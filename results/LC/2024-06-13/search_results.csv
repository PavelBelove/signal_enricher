The Most Important Logistics Tech Trends of 2021,https://ctsi-global.com/es/2021/the-logistics-tech-trends-that-should-be-on-every-shippers-radar-in-2021/,N/A,"The digital audio tape of the 1980s. Google Glass of the 2010s. Sometimes, new technology generates a whole lot of hype before ultimately sinking into obsolescence and obscurity. For logistics leaders already facing tight budgets and immense pressure to deliver results, this can make determining the right time to invest in emerging logistics tech seem like an impossible task. How can you be sure you’re not sinking huge amounts of money and staff time into a tool that will never live up to its promise?

The short answer is, you can’t. The only certainties in life are death and taxes. But by keeping up to date with the rapidly evolving logistics tech landscape and seeing how other companies are starting to put new tools into play, you can make better decisions about when and where to invest.

With that in mind, here are three logistics tech trends that are worth keeping on your radar this year.

Technology that allows for real-time visibility and data-driven decision-making

The Internet of Things (IoT) has made the whole world more connected. For shippers, the ubiquity of sensors and other IoT technology is cause for excitement because it brings real-time visibility in the supply chain within reach.

While logistics experts have been talking about this trend for years, the technology has only recently reached a level of both maturity and accessibility to make the dream of real-time visibility a reality. To take full advantage of it, though, shippers also need analytics capabilities that will enable them to rapidly make sense of all the data that their operations generate every day and extract actionable insights. That’s why at CTSI-Global, we partner with Sisense to provide shippers with business intelligence tools that empower true data-driven decision-making on a daily basis.

Technology that will make shippers more efficient and less prone to error

Artificial intelligence (AI) has been getting a lot of buzz in recent years. Still, without a robust data science team and the resources to invest in a multi-year program, it’s unlikely that many companies will unlock the full potential of AI in the supply chain for some time. The same is true of machine learning (ML); while it may one-day power revolutionary logistics tech, it takes time for the system to learn and grow enough to be helpful—time which many companies simply can’t commit to.

However, another trend that’s often mentioned in the same breath as AI and ML is much more accessible today: robotic process automation.

Robotic process automation isn’t about replacing humans. It’s about figuring out which touchpoints benefit from human input and which are better handled by automated tools. This can not only reduce errors and increase efficiency but can also minimize the amount of time employees have to spend on tedious, repetitive tasks that aren’t a good use of their skills—allowing them to focus on more strategic, business-critical work.

Technology that will enable greater business continuity in the face of future disruptions

In the wake of the pandemic, many companies are recognizing that they need to do more to ensure greater business continuity in the event of unprecedented disruptions. Just-in-time manufacturing and distribution models were especially hard hit by the global health crisis, exposing vulnerabilities and putting pressure on supply chain leaders to figure out how they can future-proof their operations.

There are no easy answers, but the pandemic may speed up the adoption of autonomous vehicles, drone delivery systems, robotic fulfillment centers, and other supply chain technologies that rely on minimal human contact. That’s not to say that companies need to rush out and invest in expensive robots and self-driving trucks right away, but keep an eye on this trend as it develops.

Uncover the top logistics tech solutions for 2023

By Martyn Verhaegen (pictured)

CTO Digital Forwarding at Magaya

For the logistics industry at large, there’s no question that digital transformation is at the top of the list in 2023 and beyond. To stay competitive in a down market, freight forwarders and logistics service providers (LSPs) need to find novel ways to lower costs and save time, improve operational performance, and enhance the customer experience.

Here are four of the top freight technology investment opportunities to consider to stimulate growth and increase market share.

1. Visibility for all stakeholders

It’s clear to see that visibility will continue to be a priority in 2023 and beyond. Visibility solutions equip forwarders and their shipper customers with timely, actionable freight data that can be used to improve supply chain performance, resilience, and agility.

Shippers are able to make data-based decisions when they matter most, achieve significant improvements to operational performance, inventory management, and efficiency with accurate visibility information. Additionally, when visibility data is shared with all supply chain stakeholders, a more effective, streamlined, and reliable flow of goods to market is achieved and a higher level of customer satisfaction. It all adds up to provide shipment partners with the competitive edge that’s so critical to business success today.

Over the next 5-10 years, forwarders and LSPs, and their customers, will see significant improvements to visibility solutions as data becomes more accurate and actionable, nearing real-time. Moreover, advancements in technology, such as machine learning and AI (artificial intelligence) will enable more predictive data to continually enhance supply chain performance.

Within warehouses, forwarders are elevating their shipper customers’ experience with online visibility tools that offer easy access to essential shipment information. This is particularly important as e-commerce transactions continue to be a preferred channel for consumers requiring companies to respond quickly, in less than 24 hours in some cases, to online purchases.

Web-based freight solutions provide shippers with self-service capabilities for functions such as, reviewing inventory in the warehouse, viewing warehouse receipts, cargo releases, and pick-up orders. There’s no need for phone calls and emails to gather this information when a shipper can quickly and easily access it online. Additionally, online reports enable shippers to review actionable product data, such as part numbers, purchase orders, inventory, and status messages for better data-based decisions.

2. An integrated and connected platform

While it once seemed like a vast improvement on paper-based communication, e-mail simply isn’t cutting it anymore in today’s fast-paced market. After all, supply chain success hinges on effective collaboration: between agents, forwarders, carriers, customers, government agencies, and more. Given the complexity of modern logistics and the volumes of data that need to be shared, digitally connecting and integrating solutions is the most effective approach to building a comprehensive freight technology platform. Selective integrations with specific digital solutions that marry up with a forwarders’ strengths and customers’ needs is the pathway to building a platform that is tailored to a forwarders’ unique qualities and offers a better customer experience and competitive advantage.

As an example, seamless integrations for shipment orchestration areas such as rate management reduces redundant, manual data entry and errors, offering faster time to value, and increased online visibility to rate data for all parties to a shipment.

3. A collaboration must – CRM

Market challenges and competitive pressures emphasize the importance for forwarders to advance their customer and sales management processes with a systematized CRM (customer relationship management) designed to address the unique sales and customer engagement requirements of their logistics business.

A system for leads, contacts, and accounts managed in a single platform helps to eliminate unproductive data silos, fosters a more efficient process, and the ability to boost sales. All staff work with the same up-to-date information and are more effective as they collaborate across teams and management.

Given the challenges of falling freight volumes, a CRM can also provide a vital opportunity to grow the business with marketing campaigns. Keep contact with existing customers to boost loyalty and reach out to prospective ones to ensure they stay top of mind.

4. Digitized customer experience

B2B customers have come to expect the same frictionless, streamlined experience in their workday as they have as a consumer. This means fast, easy, online access to useful information whenever they want it day or night.

This always-on, digitally-enabled world has created growing pressure to allow shipper customers to transact digitally when it comes to their freight execution and management processing needs. When forwarders enable shippers to transact digitally, they’re investing in the digital tools that strengthen their connection with customers, offering the best experience possible, frictionless, and responsive which is an important step in strengthening business relationships.

Digital forwarders provide a customer-facing freight execution portal that offers shipper customers immediate access to digital freight execution tools, such as online freight rates, schedules, cargo booking within minutes, and tracking information. This capability saves shippers time and gives them immediate access to timely freight data that allows them to promptly address exceptions to keep their supply chain running smoothly.

Furthermore, providing customers with digital tools strengthens a forwarders’ competitive position and ability to grow market share by adding a fresh channel to gain new customers.

Now, as we sail into 2023, it’s time to carefully evaluate if your forwarding and logistics company is meeting the stringent digital expectations of global shipping, making those important connections, and delivering the best customer experience.",logistics tech startup collaboration

This article seeks to offer insight into the substantial benefits achieved through investing in a comprehensive logistics digital transformation strategy as part of a wider plan for businesses in the transportation and logistics sector. We will also outline how this technology for logistics can help them gain a distinct advantage over competitors operating within dynamic markets alongside rapidly shifting customer expectations across multiple industries.

Benefits Of Digital Transformation for the Logistics Industry

Logistic companies adopting DX initiatives can expect several advantageous outcomes, including:

Increased Efficiency

As logistics and supply chain technology advances, the need of the hour is digital transformation in logistics. This includes cloud-based software from providers, allowing for centralized tracking and recording of transactions. With the help of this tech, logistic companies can provide customers with detailed information about progress to guarantee consistent and quality performance. As time progresses, the importance of this unified technology platform will only grow further.

Facilitates Trust Among stakeholders

The logistics industry is taking a big step forward by integrating blockchain-enabled digital shipping solutions within companies. This move builds trust between partners and helps the industry realize its ambitions of greater technological advancement.

Digital transformation in logistics has made it possible for customers to track their orders from beginning to end, offering both time and money-saving benefits. When people want to know when they can expect their shipment or if any changes have occurred, they no longer need to ask; they can head online or receive an automated message with all the relevant information included. Plus, when all parts of the process are kept informed, everyone benefits: trust increases, and bottlenecks decrease.

Enhanced Routing

Investment into state-of-the-art software has resulted in a major shift in the logistics industry – improved routing. Thanks to digital transformation in logistics and supply chains, drivers can easily identify the most efficient routes with minimal navigation and delay risks. If there are congestion issues such as road works or traffic accidents, alternative paths will be suggested to reach the destination without delays. Financially, this technology helps logistic companies save money by allowing vehicles to use shorter routes, drive fewer miles and consume less gas.

Preventive Fleet Supervision

AI-enabled predictive maintenance in supply chains and logistics is a boon for companies. It allows them to identify vehicle problems and take preventive measures remotely. With the early identification of vehicles needing repairs, teams can quickly respond to minimize downtime, reducing costs significantly. It provides a cost-benefit, and customers know the logistics firm provides reliable services for their peace of mind.

Intelligence in Transportation

Logistics processes have seen an increase in data since the digitalization of operations. As a result, businesses should consider investing in advanced analytical techniques for better decision-making in the logistics industry. Cognitive Computing and AI software development services are needed for making informed decisions regarding marketing strategies. Still, they can also provide supply chain management, process optimization, cost-efficiency, improved customer experience, and increased communication from start to finish.

The Impact of Digital Transformation in Logistics

The e-commerce industry has had a major impact of digital technologies on logistics efficiency; companies are rapidly turning to digital solutions such as improved communication systems and tracking software, which increases efficiency and easily facilitates collaboration between carriers, shippers, and cargo forwarders. Logistical projects focus on maintaining maximum efficiency at minimal costs while providing quick and hassle-free delivery to customers. Technologies such as blockchain, IoT, and AI are revolutionizing how business is conducted in logistics to accomplish this goal.

360 Logistic Supply Visibility

Companies must find efficient methods for gathering supply transport data from various sources like ERPs, spreadsheets, custom methods, and payables for maximum visibility. This is where the 360 approach proves useful. It integrates all the disparate data into a single system, giving ongoing understanding.

It lets organizations track and manage goods throughout the logistics network, giving them a timeline view of information submitted by each company involved. Utilizing the 360 approach keeps everyone using the same information which provides clear visibility to all activities and outcomes within the logistics chain.

Actual Time Information/Data

Synchronized data are a crucial component of supply network visibility, enabling organizations to observe the state as it stands in real-time. In transportation, where changes can happen unpredictably, the ability to process and source the exact data (especially regarding routes, locations, carriers, and stops) helps businesses adjust immediately.

Furthermore, this data lets Freighters generate the most efficient routes based on the current situations, reducing the possibility of being held up in major transit hubs and ports. Investing in exact insights provides an extra layer of efficiency for better service and customer experience.

Integrated Internet of Things Supply Chains

Today, IoT technologies revolutionize supply chain operations. IoT devices capture product identification and sorting data, shipment routes, location tracking, and inventory management. Combining IoT and computer vision to capture and process data instantly reduces the risk of human error associated with manual document filling.

Due to that automation, stores can track issues, wears and tear, or lost shipments in real-time without additional effort. Additionally, through AI-powered IoT vehicles, freight transport is becoming more efficient by offering optimized loading/unloading solutions and route optimization between ports.

Automation Services

In the current business landscape, automated logistics processes are imperative in streamlining the activities of couriers and shipment forwarders. With automation, an array of time taking and also error-free tasks can be facilitated—from freight identification to tracking, path planning, timeline administration, quoting, bidding, and storehouse operations. All players involved in the logistic chain stand to gain from optimized data processing and software for automation purposes.

What are the Digital Technologies used in Logistics?

The logistics and transportation sector can benefit from many technologies. These technology used in logistics:

Blockchain

Blockchain technology in logistics and supply chains can be immensely beneficial for international cargo shipments. Smart contracts and dApps are providing a much-needed increase in trust and visibility within supply chains, offering secure data distribution, decentralization, and validation. In particular, blockchain has proven incredibly useful for improving shipment visibility.

Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)

Augmented Reality has the potential to fundamentally transform the use of warehouses and cross-docking areas by revolutionizing their picking, packing, and commissioning operations – and providing a major competitive edge for logistics companies. Additionally, Virtual Reality can offer significant advantages regarding package delivery. Critical shipping info such as weight, content, and handling directions can be shown on windshields or VR glasses – meaning drivers no longer need to access handheld devices to check alternate routes, traffic jams, or blocked roads.

Big Data Analytics

Logistics companies have access to immense datasets, and sophisticated algorithms are necessary to comprehend the entirety of those data points. Deep learning is a beneficial tool, enabling them to convert large amounts of often unstructured data into actionable insights. By analyzing big data, they will be able to determine what adjustments should be made to stay ahead in the competitive market. Moreover, as deep learning can discover correlations from high-dimensional datasets, it may be instrumental in helping logistics companies spot potential problems that could result in costly delays or a negative CX.

Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning

AI and ML can address supply chain issues of governance and long-standing data silos, allowing for improved visibility and integration throughout the remote network of stakeholders. Digital logistics platforms can provide interconnected systems that enable logistic service providers to optimize operations, creating a better experience for customers.

Client Issues and Needs: The large-scale manufacturing enterprise requires complex supply chain and logistics solutions to stay competitive in an ever-changing landscape. Key issues included decentralized operations needing more visibility across the supply chain, data errors related to goods receipts and sales orders, and inefficient processes caused by disparate manual tasks. As a result, the company’s operational efficiency suffered.

Our client sought a comprehensive supply chain logistics software development solution to address these challenges, automating their processes, optimizing productivity and cost-effectiveness, streamlining the data flow between different systems, and scaling accordingly.

Our solution: Our team dived deep into this project by taking the time to understand the client’s needs comprehensively. We worked rigorously – with developers, designers, and project managers – to ideate and enact a supply chain logistics software solution that best suits their business. With multiple factors at play during this selection process (such as supply chain visibility, product deployment speed, and technological support), we eventually decided on Robotic Process Automation (RPA) coupled with data analytics.

Using AI-powered RPA paired with analytics provided insight into their supply chain. Through complete visibility into process execution and root cause analysis, our system improved the company’s operational efficiency tremendously. The bots automated manual processes, so multiple error types are now searched for records, resolved when found, and workflow completion is done automatically through an email sent to stakeholders.

FourKites Joins Consortium Streamlining Logistics Tech,https://www.miragenews.com/fourkites-joins-consortium-streamlining-1244148/,28 мая 2024 г.,"FourKites is the first real-time visibility platform participating in the SSC

CHICAGO--BUSINESS WIRE--

Leading real-time supply chain visibility provider FourKites® today announced its role as a Collaborator in the Scheduling Standards Consortium (SSC) as the first real-time visibility platform participating. FourKites joins organizations involved with the SSC - including Arrive Logistics, BlueYonder, Coyote Logistics, DHL, e2open, Echo, J.B. Hunt Transport, Lineage, Mastery, One Network Enterprises, Oracle, Ryder, TI NTG, Uber Freight, Werner and Worldwide Express - which aims to foster greater efficiency within the supply chain technology landscape.

Freight scheduling has been a pervasive problem for the supply chain, compounded by the past decade's tremendous growth and diversification in scheduling solutions. Shippers and carriers today are responsible for juggling dozens of methods of scheduling freight with shippers, each with their own interface and API, which creates friction and inefficiencies throughout the supply chain.

In response to this challenge, J.B. Hunt and Uber Freight joined forces in 2022 to establish the SSC, to create the first universal appointment scheduling standard in the form of an API. With many leading organizations now involved and driving the Standard forward, the SSC's goal is to simplify the integration of systems across the fragmented ecosystem between shippers, carriers and intermediaries to create a more efficient appointment scheduling process. The SSC has endorsed a universal standard for the API, released October 2, 2023, which eliminates the need for multiple interfaces and allows carriers to interact through a single interface.

""Embracing a universal scheduling API unlocks seamless coordination across supply chains,"" explains Viral Parekh, Head of Logistics Operations at The Kraft Heinz Company. ""As more companies endorse this unified approach, we pave the way for unparalleled system efficiency, streamlining operations and driving transformative growth throughout the industry.""

FourKites is collaborating with the SSC because of its proven commitment to optimizing ecosystem performance, carrier success and building a more user-friendly operating environment. In addition, FourKites' robust customer base and recognized industry leadership enables it to play a role in developing the API and accelerating adoption across its customer and partner network. With over 100,000 appointments scheduled in the platform every month, Appointment Manager is one of FourKites' fastest-growing products, as it significantly eliminates the friction associated with manual time slot booking.

""We're thrilled to participate in this consortium of industry heavy-hitters,"" said Mathew Elenjickal, founder and CEO of FourKites. ""A single API between our Appointment Manager solution and our shippers' carrier networks will create a frictionless operating environment for everyone involved, and will make FourKites customers Shippers of Choice, with lower cost to serve and a reliable, reputable integration.""

The SSC's main objectives are to define the API standard for sharing scheduling information, eliminate manual processes by automating interactions where possible, implement standardized interfaces and integrations across core platforms, and advocate the standard across the industry.

The Future of Transportation Management Systems (TMS),https://activantcapital.com/research/tms,N/A,"Introduction

Since their introduction more than 50 years ago, Transportation Management System (TMS) software has grown to become a mission-critical component enabling the worldwide movement of goods. Your most recent grocery haul and new home exercise equipment, along with your business’ purchase of everything from office supplies to raw materials and inventory was made possible by a TMS. Over the years, TMSs have grown in size and scale, and have permeated all of the steps in the supply chain. Yet despite their ubiquity, we believe that today’s TMSs simply aren’t enough. They are old and legacy, don’t serve the mid-market or smaller customers efficiently, are missing key features, and often create more pain points and clumsy workarounds than the number of business problems they solve.

But we believe that is changing – largely because compelling new logistics tech companies are entering the market. In this article, we offer an overview and history of the category, as well as two frameworks to understand the product and distribution of TMSs and how to think about the emerging vendors. Throughout our research, we asked ourselves: does a next generation TMS even need to be a TMS at all? Some of today’s most compelling new vendors might offer their own TMS or TMS-like features but are agnostic as to whether you use them for that or not. Their real value-add is sitting on top of existing TMS systems and leveraging data created to offer compelling new insights and actions.

Setting the Stage

What is a TMS, and why should we even care what generation we’re on? A TMS is a software platform that tracks the physical movement of goods from point A to point B – everything from planning which carrier to use and at what rate, to tendering and executing the shipment, to tracking the load’s progress, to settlement and analysis after delivery.

A TMS is a mission-critical, system-of-record workflow software that drives revenues and manages expenses in a logistics industry that can be cyclical, competitive, and low-margin. Generally, all key parties involved in the supply chain – including shipper, carrier, freight forwarder, and broker – have their own version of a TMS to support their differentiated role in the movement of goods. The TMS is used daily by anyone in these organizations that help manage freight.

Ultimately the promise of a TMS – its stated value proposition – is to optimize a business’ transportation operations. Through centralized planning and data, and improved execution and tracking, an effective TMS can provide clear visibility and analysis of freight shipments. This leads to fewer disruptions and delays, better use of resources, and improved profitability.

It’s of little surprise that the TMS market is large and growing, with analysts projecting 15% to 19% annual growth through the rest of the decade to reach a market size of between $31B to $45B globally. TMS adoption is also high. According to recent industry surveys, 90% of carriers with more than 20 trucks and 68% of brokers use a TMS. Overall, 61% of logistics professionals, irrespective of firm size, use some form of TMS today, vs. 15% in 2005.

$45B Projected TMS Market Size by 2030

TMSs have created an incredible amount of value to date. Today, the leading providers have valuations in the tens of billions on hundreds of millions or more of revenue. Blue Yonder had over $500M of annualized recurring revenue at the time of their sale to Panasonic, Descartes boasts nearly $500M of annualized services revenue from their most recent quarter, and WiseTech’s market cap stands at $17B. The top 5 vendors in this massive market control ~17% market share.

History

But today’s TMSs are old. The leading TMS vendors were mostly founded in the 1970s and 80s, built on inflexible mainframes from suppliers like IBM. They started by digitizing manual processes and paper-based workflows. They offered basic features like planning, visibility, and execution, while centralizing shipment data. And they focused on serving the enterprise, particularly the enterprise shipper, who ultimately controlled the budget on shipping spend.

Legacy players fall into three groups:

The original supply chain management software vendors who started in the 1970s, like E2Open and Descartes; Enterprise software vendors who have expanded into logistics, like SAP and Oracle; More “recent” TMS vendors like Mercury Gate, who launched their solution in 2000, over two decades ago.

Limitations and Pain Points

Over the years, the legacy TMS options have not kept up with the needs of their customers. Incumbent solutions are challenging to use, limited in features, expensive, and slow. Their UI/UX is dated and feels ‘Web 1.0’. Implementation times and ramp-up periods are long and cumbersome.

As the supply chain grows ever more complex, customers have asked for greater functionality – such as procuring freight capacity, offering real-time visibility, extending into the warehouse, and handling multiple transportation modalities. However, TMS vendors have been unable to follow through, and meaningful gaps have emerged in their solutions. According to a recent survey, only 60% of current TMS providers offer procurement & sourcing, only 50% offer warehouse management capabilities, and visibility solutions remain surprisingly simplistic, a lot of ‘dots on a map’, as do post-shipment reporting and analytics.

In addition, the incumbents have not served the mid-market or smaller customers well. They have yet to fully adapt their offerings for the cloud in order to lower the upfront investment to smaller customers. High fees, long deployments, slow product development, and poor customer support have inhibited adoption.

Like many other software categories dominated by incumbents, the legacy players have been more focused on M&A to acquire products and customers rather than investing in R&D. This trend has been accelerating. From the end of Q1 2021 to the end of Q2 2022, there were 115 acquisitions as the leading vendors continue to roll up the industry. In the first half of 2023, CargoWise (part of WiseTech) spent nearly 6x more on M&A than on R&D (i.e., AU$ 115M on R&D vs AU$ 644M on M&A).

115 Acquisitions by leading TMS vendors from Q1'21 to Q2'22

It’s no surprise, then, that nobody likes their existing legacy TMS platform. We’ve heard complaints in nearly all of our conversations with supply chain companies and users. Everyone is on the spectrum between growing dissatisfaction to outright dislike. But remember the system-of-record nature of TMSs. Despite their issues, legacy TMS vendors have continued to dominate and claim the lion’s share of the market, simply because “nobody gets fired for buying IBM.”

The Rise of the Next Generation

But there is good news.

We see an incredible opportunity in the market to build a better TMS to address customer pain points and better serve unhappy customers, large and small. The stars have aligned for next-generation TMS vendors to gain real traction, challenge the incumbents, and build foundational businesses.

Beyond the shortcomings of the existing solutions, several more factors have helped create this opportunity:

Over the last few years, we’ve seen increasing complexity and vulnerability in the supply chain , made evident by the disruptions caused by COVID, geo-political conflicts, and big headline-grabbing events like the blockages in the Suez Canal.

We have spent a lot of time in this category and have talked to many leading TMS vendors and their customers. Before jumping in, it’s worth stepping back and noting that there are 1500+ TMS vendors globally. To simplify this market, we have segmented the world based on key criteria, including target market and geography, tech offering, number of features, and model complexity. This resulted in 4 broad non-mutually exclusive categories: Legacy Incumbents; Specialized Tech-Natives; Cross-Stakeholder Tech-Natives; and TMS Orchestrators.

We think of the Legacy Incumbents as both the initial providers of TMS solutions and multinational enterprise software players. Their solutions are often part of a larger tech suite and face many of the challenges we’ve discussed above.

as both the initial providers of TMS solutions and multinational enterprise software players. Their solutions are often part of a larger tech suite and face many of the challenges we’ve discussed above. The Tech-Natives generally have more streamlined and flexible interfaces, which makes for a better user experience. Amongst these, the Specialized providers typically focus on a specific stakeholder in the supply chain, at least to start, offering a differentiated and richer solution to that segment. By contrast, the Cross-Stakeholder platforms focus on connecting multiple stakeholders across the supply chain.

Amongst these, the providers typically focus on a specific stakeholder in the supply chain, at least to start, offering a differentiated and richer solution to that segment. By contrast, the platforms focus on connecting multiple stakeholders across the supply chain. The Orchestrators usually integrate into and improve existing TMS solutions, whether through simplifying cross-platform communication, plugging feature gaps, or scaling across adjacent segments of the supply chain.

Back to the Basics: Product and Distribution

Now armed with our Market Map, we want to double click on the interesting categories and companies to help emerging TMS vendors think about how to tactically approach the market and grow their business. We believe every TMS vendor should be thinking about two major considerations: (1) product features, and (2) distribution approaches. We highlight these approaches to building product, tied together by our TMS Features Pyramid framework below, and discuss three approaches to distribution.

The Activant Product Pyramid

Our Product Pyramid framework presents how to think about the various products and features that a TMS can offer:

Activant Capital Framework TMS Product Pyramid

At the bottom of the pyramid, Core features include optimizing loads, identifying and selecting the best carriers and routes, shipment tracking through connectivity and communication, settlement, and reporting, and analysis. These are the basic tools to get shipments from A to B.

In the middle layer, Advanced features deliver improved forecasting, planning, management, and automation for users. They address the demand for increased resilience, globalization, and sustainability.

Finally, at the top of the pyramid, Orchestrator features include making better use of large data sets, usually with artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as deeper integrations with other systems to enable automated changes, transactions, and execution to reduce humans-in-the-loop. These features are still less common, though many vendors are actively building and refining them.

The Orchestrators

Supply chain software vendors focused on the top of the pyramid are looking to be the intelligence or orchestration layer. They usually don’t offer a TMS, and instead look to integrate with a customers’ existing TMS vendors to generate insights that the TMSs themselves don’t have and can’t offer. In doing so, they provide the final layer of features required to elevate a TMS to the next generation, but they do so without providing a TMS themselves – hence the next-gen TMS may not be a TMS. This segment is tied to the ""Orchestrators"" segment in our Activant TMS Market Map.

The primary benefit of this approach is to simplify a customer’s fragmented supply chain tech stack, allowing for a ‘single pane of glass’ to monitor and control everything. There isn’t a need to replace entrenched incumbents, minimizing cost and disruption, as well as shortening sales cycles. However, these solutions are not typically the system of record – relegating that task to the legacy TMS – and this could reduce the overall stickiness of the platform.

Logixboard enables previously analog freight forwarders and carriers to become competitive digital freight players. They provide a white label solution for their customers, while taking care of all the back-end integrations and functionality. A big plus and driver of adoption is the ease with which they can integrate the TMSs of their customer's shippers.

Pando has developed their TMS product over the past five years, to what is now their Fulfilment Cloud. This delivers an AI-powered no-code platform with end-to-end collaboration from shipper to customer. In addition to providing many of the solutions expected of a next-gen TMS, their products attempt to unlock customer benefits like new GTM channels, circular economy and ESG solutions, digitization, manufacturing innovation, supply chain integrations for M&A, etc.

Optimal Dynamics is a leading innovator in automated decision-making for freight management. They integrate into existing TMS systems and build digital twins of a supply chain network, thus aiding decision-making by predicting loads to increase the probability of being profitable. Our discussions with clients and experts suggest their solution is highly accurate and offers significant depth and breadth of information.

Leaf Logistics is the ‘air traffic control’ that sits agnostically on top of multiple TMSs. Their two main products are Flex and Adapt. Flex helps shippers identify future transport needs and locks in carriers at fixed rates to ensure consistent demand and lower costs. Adapt is a shipper software monitoring timeliness, savings, and sustainability. The company also plans to launch Pay to help pay LSPs in 30 vs 120 days.

ISO.io is a performance management solution. By mapping internal & customer SLAs and aggregating data from a company’s TMS, ERP, and other core systems. ISO.io benchmarks and identifies discrepancies to generate carrier scorecards. ISO then allows carriers to refute a claim, which often translates to real dollars in carrier’s pockets. Additionally, this data is available to the whole organization, breaking down silos between transport, sales, finance, and customer service.

As technology enables better visibility in this industry, focusing on multiple stakeholders and systems to orchestrate the flow of data is key."" Julian Alvarez, Founder & CEO, Logixboard

The Vertical Approach

Companies with a vertical focus are building solutions for a specific segment (e.g. customer type, part of the value chain, modality, or business model). Nonetheless, they can evolve to serve more segments over time. This segment ties most closely to the ""Specialized Tech-Natives"" segment in our Activant TMS Market Map.

Specific problems are more easily addressed by specialized solutions, allowing for a quicker and cheaper GTM strategy, as well as easier upsell opportunities. They are more effective at solving market-specific needs, which makes them valuable for companies growing beyond ‘off the shelf’ standard solutions. The biggest drawbacks could be a smaller addressable market, limited diversification potential, and subsequent niche concentration risk. Companies to highlight:

MyCarrier started out as offering a TMS to SMBs who needed to ship LTL (less than truckload). By partnering with many LTL carriers, they serve shippers, who can more easily connect and automate shipment execution. They are now expanding into ERP order integration and freight audit.

Exo Freight focuses on the open-deck shipping segment . Their own, or clients internal, shipper-focused TMSs combine with a carrier management portal to provide an extensive marketplace and network.

Cargoful is a next-generation TMS enabling E2E (end-to-end) order management for carriers. A differentiator is their use of machine learning and operations-research tech to support long haul, last mile, and urban delivery.

The Whole Shebang

“The Whole Shebang” approach is exactly what it sounds like – the construction of an entire TMS from the ground up. Naturally, building from the ground up requires significantly more time and invested capital than either of the other to Product approaches, but in replacing the incumbent TMS, these players will enjoy a hire stickiness than pure Orchestrators. However, success also requires (1) clear product market fit, (2) the flexibility to tailor the product to multiple stakeholders and (3) the ability to overcome the stickiness of the incumbents.

To our knowledge, the only player currently exploring this route is Mastery Logistics Systems. They are building an enterprise-level platform which attempts to roll up all customers’ (initially carriers & brokers) existing TMSs and functionality, irrespective of mode.

Building a TMS from scratch is really ******* hard, which is why it’s worth doing! Nobody has been able to build a TMS in decades that provides the whole solution for the enterprise – we are uniquely capable of delivering what the industry badly needs."" Jeff Silver, Co-Founder & CEO, Mastery

Distribution

While Product remains an axis we use to index companies, we have found Distribution strategy to be an equally compelling tool for segmentation. Here, we highlight three notable approaches to distribution that we have consistently seen from current TMS vendors. Our Distribution graphic below captures these strategies and illustrates how the core offering starts near the center but then grows outwards into untapped markets.

Multiple Stakeholders

These vendors aim to provide solutions for different stakeholders (e.g. shippers, carriers, brokers, forwarders, 3PLs, NVOCCs). They often start with one key relationship, which in turn generates a client-driven cross-sell. The strength of these products is in their cross-sell potential, which in turn can lead to network effects between stakeholders. However, in building for multiple parties, this approach risks creating misaligned incentives in product-market fit – where multiple parties have different product requirements. This segment ties most closely to the ""Cross-Stakeholder Tech-Natives"" segment in our Activant TMS Market Map.

FreightPop provides a TMS with a comprehensive feature set that addresses a wide range of stakeholders (from manufacturers to 3PLs). Notably, they provide rate shopping, freight visibility, freight planning, and freight audit.

Rose Rocket offers a TMS with a menu of integrations that allow their clients to quickly automate and connect data internally and, importantly, across their network of customers, drivers, and partners.

Turvo, an Activant portfolio company that is now part of Lineage Logistics, was one of the early next-gen TMS companies. It was built on the premise of collaboration by breaking down the walls between different stakeholders, systems, and processes.

Pallet, an Activant Portfolio company, offers an integrated platform that combines a Transportation Management System (TMS), a Warehouse Management System (WMS) and a Billing System. Over time, the company also plans to build and integrate an Order Management System (OMS). This unified SaaS platform becomes the “Operating System” for 3PLs that eliminates the need for customers to reinput data across multiple siloed platforms that individually accomplish a segment of the solution.

Alternative Monetization

These vendors use their TMS as a wedge into a customer and monetize indirectly (but not with TMS fees). So, the TMS might be almost free and then revenues are generated via alternate embedded products or monetizing different stakeholders. Obviously, it is hard to beat free, which also shortens sales cycles. Additionally, new technology makes it easier to embed solutions, and there is greater potential to align incentives with customers. A drawback could be a perception of a less valuable product, with customers wondering ""what's the catch?"" MVMNT offers their TMS for a minimal cost and monetize via financial services tools like factoring, and insurance which allows SMB brokers to become more attractive & competitive.

MVMNT offers their TMS for a minimal cost and monetize via financial services tools like factoring, and insurance which allows SMB brokers to become more attractive & competitive.

Emerge uses their (essentially free) TMS to provide dynamic RFPs to shippers. This in turn attracts carriers to their marketplace – from which they monetize based on transactions.

Zuum provides a free TMS which integrates to their digital freight marketplace. In doing so, they enable all stakeholders to effectively become digital brokers and capture capacity, carriers and data.

Land & Expand

Somewhat like Orchestrators, these vendors have created solutions that aren’t typical TMSs, but enhance their functionality. The strength of these products is in their speed to market and shortened sales cycle. Furthermore, they offer classic ‘land and expand’ opportunities (both within a customer and across the value chain). However, they carry the risk of being perceived as a point solution initially.

Leverage.ai promises one platform that easily integrates into existing systems, providing end-to-end visibility across the entire supply chain lifecycle. We like the customization, flexibility, and scalability – all of which we think are necessary for a next-gen TMS solution.

Conclusion

We’re excited about the next five years – the next 50 years even – for TMS. There will always be physical goods to move, and there will always need to be systems to enable that. We’re eager to see what those new systems will look like, and what the leading next-generation TMS vendors are already building today. And if we’re right, many of those next-gen TMS’s won’t need to be a TMS at all!",logistics tech startup collaboration
Transparency: The Most Important Pillar Of Future Logistics,https://www.freightify.com/blog/transparency-important-pillar-of-future-logistics,N/A,"It is common to find mentions in sectoral environments of ""visibility"" and ""transparency.â However, not all the companiesâ visible data is shared with their partners. This is one of the reasons why greater transparency in supply chains is demanded.

Many suppliers, transporters, freight forwarders, or logistics operators raise doubts about being totally transparent with their customers. Often companies detect deficiencies through this information. However, they prefer to manage problems before the customer realizes them.

On the other hand, many shippers are not comfortable sharing data with their suppliers or vendors. In these cases, there is a concern about intellectual property, financial margins, or security risks. This is understandable since this information allows the situation to be detected and controlled at all times. However, this behaviour can translate into a lack of trust between the different links in the supply chain.

There is no doubt that when there is a collaboration between a supplier and a customer, transparency helps to create trust. When agents can demonstrate that they have the tools and capacity to deal with potential contingencies, they are excellent supply chain partners.

In this way, the visibility and transparency of these partners create an atmosphere of genuine collaboration. Over time, the links in the supply chain learn to complement each other and drive efficient practices for all parties.

Many of the actors in the supply chain already have Big Data tools or systems to monitor their operations.

SUPPLY CHAIN ââAGENTS

However, there are still many actors who cannot collect data or give it visibility. They simply don't have enough tools or structure. It is obvious that to solve this situation, it is necessary to go step by step. As individual and local supply chains gain visibility and trust, their models can be integrated into new trends in efficiency and transparency. It is a matter of furthering the relationships between the partners. This will take a step forward in achieving collaborative logistics.

Today, most of the actors involved in the supply chain are familiar with this concept. In reality, many shippers and customers can track their incoming and outgoing shipments or deliveries in real-time. There is even a sea of ââdata thanks to the development of cloud storage technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (MLS), the internet of things (IoT), and other technologies such as the blockchain. However, less than 10% of current supply chain data is used effectively.

It is not enough to monitor the data. Proactive and helpful monitoring is achieved when we can make decisions through that data. Data analytics systems are in full development, but they are still imprecise. It takes an effort to address both planned and unplanned situations and execute accurate decisions. Currently, these systems are capable of making decisions to expedite a shipment or to find alternative routes. By analyzing data from past and current operations, companies can make reasonable predictions to optimize existing functions in the supply chain and avoid predictable risks.



INTEGRABLE ASPECTS

Some of the aspects that are part of the supply chain present available data. It is really about making an effort to integrate them. Some of these aspects are discussed below.

Flow of goods

Most modern operators have constant data monitoring systems, for example, from transportation management systems (TMS), resource planning solutions (ERP), warehouse management systems (WMS), partner networks, and many other sources. The aggregation and integration of this disparate data can be used to address a wide range of problems across different facets of the supply chain.

Route planning

Transportation departments generate perfectly planned routes. The objectives are to optimize times, save fuel, achieve JIT shipments, manage full loads, optimize service hours, driving and rest times, avoid empty returns, and other aspects. The management of this data can be used in collaborative logistics.

Performance of operations

Optimizing global supply chains is very complex. Typically, manufacturers are influenced by manufacturers, who monitor their internal assets, operations, and suppliers and identify areas for improvement or cost savings. The operations of third-party agents that must move in a coordinated manner, such as carriers, warehousing, customs managers, legalization agents, insurers, etc., also influence. Data management is a valuable tool for performance monitoring. The optimum of each link does not always lead to the optimum of the global chain.

Risk management

Tracking data management makes it easy to identify potential risks. The visibility of this data also helps to plan corrective and preventive actions. They are essential to avoid delays or inappropriate practices. In supply chains, tracking data enables future shipments to be planned based on the results obtained from monitoring past shipments. Similarly, manufacturers and service providers can plan their operations based on monitoring histories.

Sustainability

The environmental management of companies or their impacts extend beyond their facilities. Most of the aspects that contribute to the carbon footprint are related to the movement of consumer products. The visibility and monitoring of the data allow you to make ethical and sustainable decisions for your business practices. Also, they must be taken into account in the search for partners, suppliers, and the rest of the agents involved in the supply chain. It is convenient to generate positive corporate visibility of its brand, its clients, and society.

Automation

Artificial intelligence, machine learning, IoT, or blockchain tools, allow organizations to improve drastically. Adequate data analysis corresponds to greater rigor in determining demand forecasts. Analyzing market trends, sales, shipping information, and other factors leads to accurate predictions and decision-making. Autonomous learning systems require large volumes of data.

Continuous improvement

Thanks to quality management, this look has already become a classic. Supply chain professionals have vast amounts of data at their disposal. Daily, they are used to solving quality-related challenges or problems. What is not measured cannot be improved. Therefore, sharing with supply chain partners will be a guarantee to finding solutions to new challenges.

VISIBILITY AND TRANSPARENCY

It is important to note that unlocking the full potential of data requires transparency. Visibility of some data is not enough. Improvements won't happen overnight. Take the time to understand where the supply chain improvement opportunities lie.

The importance of starting to address small opportunities is vital. Working step by step is the most reasonable thing to do. If a company manages its problems, applying data analysis to small projects, it will grow in global monitoring.

Large-scale data management is essential: each agent involved in the supply chain must be aware of teamwork. Every plant operation, every management, every transshipment or mode change is critical. Using data to identify these critical areas can only translate into opportunities for improvement. A complete solution like Freightify can be a game-changer for organizations that want to keep track of every detail of their operations.

What we yearn for today as end-to-end visibility or tracking is probably a goal that is never achieved. The first step is internal visibility and integration with vendor visibility. Later, it will be necessary to integrate the visibility of the rest of the agents. The challenge will be different for each company, as the factors will depend on the local practices of each site. The important thing is that the visibility of the shared data will allow companies to identify the critical areas and anticipate the risks of each supply chain.

State of Logistics: Taking Collaboration to the Next Level?,https://www.cargobusinessnews.com/featured_stories/State-of-Logistics-Taking-Collaboration-to-the-Next-Level.html,N/A,"By William DiBenedetto, CBN Feature Editor



Yes, the logistics industry is on the upswing, but there are some stubborn issues out there that could add a layer of uncertainty for even the top companies in 2016.



Those issues include pressures on margin and equipment performance due to environmental regulation, regional trade disparities, driver shortages, capacity issues, port congestion and the increasing and welcome realization that collaboration is a necessityânot just ""nice to have.""



According to the Council of Supply Chain Managementâs 26th annual ""State of Logistics Report,"" which was issued in mid-2015, the transportation sector of the logistics industry grew by 3.6 percent in 2014. ""This is largely due to consistent new job creation, higher net income of individuals, and increasing household net worth, lower rates of inflation, and reduction in the cost of gas prices."" As a result, ""the link between the cost of crude oil, gas prices, and consumer spending comes back to the forefront of the transportation industry. As consumers spend less on personal and work-related travel, they have more money to spend on other items, which strengthens the logistics industry, especially the trucking sector.""



If that sounds a somewhat fragileâdue to the continuing ""softness of the economy"" said economist Rosalyn Wilson, who wrote the CSCMP report, and because faith in low gas prices seems to be a constantâitâs because it is. The message? Keep a tight and continuous rein on spending.



The 2016 20th Annual Third Party Logistics Study shows continued collaborative and positive relationships between shippers and third-party logistics providers. This survey suggests that 3PLs and their customers are becoming more proficient at what they do, individually as well as together, which is improving the quality of their relationships. Both partiesâ93 percent of 3PL users and 94 percent of 3PL providersâreported that their relationships are successful and that their work is yielding positive results.



The study revealed that 70 percent of those who use logistics servicesâshippersâand 85 percent of 3PL providers said the use of 3PL services has contributed to overall logistics cost reductions, and 83% of shippers and 94 percent of 3PL providers said the use of 3PLs has contributed to improved customer service.



In addition, the majority of both groupsâ75 percent of shippers and 88 percent of 3PL providersâsaid 3PLs offer new and innovative ways to improve logistics effectiveness.



That said, thereâs a looming transportation capacity crisis, this has gone on for at least 20 years but could reach critical mass by 2017.



In addition, the truck driver shortage remains a

major concern for the logistics sector. The American Trucking Associations has estimated the current shortage ranges from 35,000 to 40,000 drivers. A key indicator of is driver turnover rate, which is running at more than 95 percent on an annualized basis.



The recent spate of huge mergers and acquisitions, such the $3 billion XPO Logistics purchase of Con-way late this year, is already in the rear view mirror, but the focus is likely to shift to deals involving smaller 3PLs in 2016. The hunt is apparently on for companies with IT and process capabilities to support e-commerce. In an article in Material, Handling and Logistics magazine, Frank F. Mountcastle III, managing director of the middle market M&A advisory firm Harris Williams & Co., was quoted saying, ""2016 will be very busy but it will be the year of the smaller deal"" as companies seek out add-ons to fill gaps in their transportation management and e-commerce capabilities.



The continuing climate of 3PL consolidation is seen as a defensive posture to preserve market share, become more tech-savvy, and better manage risk. A major watchword in this mix is collaboration.



As noted in a recent Amber Road white paper, many companies have not explored effective collaboration with supply chain partners because of a lack of trust. The lack of trust and control ""prevented retailers from collaborating closely with suppliers, causing friction and redundancy when both parties duplicated the same tasks,"" Amber Road said. ""With the transparency of shared data and mutual collaboration, retailers are more comfortable sharing responsibilities with suppliers.""



But recent trends toward more open and bi-lateral communication have made this challenge a non-issue, the paper continues. ""The trust factor is no longer a barrier for developing and maintaining collaborative relationships and most retailers have dismissed this as a concern.""



A growing percentage of enterprises are also rethinking their supply chain execution software portfolios, and adopting cross-functional platforms that support integrated, end-to-end business processes. That sounds a lot like collaboration.



Does consolidation help spur even deeper collaboration, or vice-versa? Actually, the two should go hand in hand. What seems certain is that an M&A canât be very successful without the willingness to collaborate.",logistics tech startup collaboration

"""The Impact of Supply Chain Innovation on Organizational ...",https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/businessdiss/17/,Автор: DH Lee,"Abstract

Supply chain management (SCM) has drawn significant attention in the health care industry in recent years because of its significant impact on hospital performance and quality of care. Since SCM is a complex system that interfaces with many different dimensions within a hospital and with suppliers, organizations need to first innovate their business processes while also considering their suppliers’ processes to accomplish effective SCM. Supply chain (SC) innovation helps organizations achieve efficiency and quality management practices for new customer value creation, which is expected to result in improved organizational performance.

This study examines the effects of innovation leadership, SC innovation, SC efficiency, and QM practices on organizational performance in the health care organization. More specifically, this study explores relationships among several factors that may influence organizational performance. Also, this study attempts to investigate differences between two health care organization groups: more than 500 and less than 500 beds.

The structural equation modeling (SEM) techniquewith AMOS 17.0 was usedto test hypotheses in the research model. The results confirmed the effect of innovation leadership on process improvement and IT application for SC innovation. The study also found positive relationships between process improvement and IT application as part of SC innovation; and SC efficiency and QM practices. In addition, the results showed the effect of operational improvement as a result of SC efficiency and QM practices on organizational performance.

International Development and Supply Chain Innovation,https://sais.jhu.edu/international-development-and-supply-chain-innovation,N/A,"Jennifer Gootman, Vice President of Social Consciousness and Innovation at West Elm

March 15, 2017

West Elm's Jennifer Gootman joined students, alumni, and guests for a discussion on how the home furnishings retailer embeds innovative programs around craft, supply chain transparency, and sustainability into its business model.

For West Elm, corporate social responsibility is about how to use business to create change in communities and think creatively about its sourcing. For instance, the company has made commitments to artisan groups, which produce about 20% of the company’s offerings. By including the artisanal products, West Elm integrates the products into its design concepts. The company is a member of Fair Trade USA’s factory certification program and in 2014, it became the first-ever home retailer to offer fair trade certified products. With nine factories around the world and over 2,300 workers, its fair trade structure allows the company to explore new and flexible ways to support the workers in its supply chain.

Addressing students, Gootman shared a story about how she landed her job. She met the company's leadership at an Aspen Institute event and actually pitched the new role to them on the spot. She believed in the direction of the company and knew her nonprofit experience would add value. She reminded students that often the most exciting opportunities are those that do not exist yet and encouraged them to seek their own path.",supply chain innovation partnership

The Logistics and Supply Chain Innovation Handbook,https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Logistics_and_Supply_Chain_Innovatio.html?id=dxJNugEACAAJ,N/A,"The Fourth Industrial Revolution is now transforming logistics and supply chain industries. Consumer habits are changing fast and supply chains are having to adapt to meet the challenges created by this dynamic new environment. Traditional logistics operating models are under threat.

Incumbent freight operators across the entire transport and warehousing spectrum have been forced to develop strategies to effectively compete with new start-ups. The Logistics and Supply Chain Innovation Handbook provides a comprehensive overview of all the major new technologies and business models currently under development and looks at this process of disruption in detail.

The Logistics and Supply Chain Innovation Handbook covers many important topics, such as crowd sourcing and shipping, on-demand delivery, autonomous vehicles, automation in the warehouse, electric vehicles and alternative fuels. It provides readers with a straightforward and easy to understand assessment of these innovations and their impact on the industry. Online supporting resources include PowerPoints and sample case studies.",supply chain innovation partnership
Supply chain collaboration,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain_collaboration,N/A,"In supply chain management, supply chain collaboration is defined as two or more autonomous firms working jointly to plan and execute supply chain operations. It can deliver substantial benefits and advantages to collaborators.[1] It is known as a cooperative strategy when one or more companies or business units work together to create mutual benefits.[2] There are two main types of supply chain collaboration: vertical collaboration and horizontal collaboration. Vertical collaboration is the collaboration when two or more organizations from different levels or stages in supply chain share their responsibilities, resources, and performance information to serve relatively similar end customers; while horizontal collaboration is an inter-organizational systemrelationship between two or more companies at the same level or stage in the supply chain in order to allow greater ease of work and cooperation towards achieving a common objective.[3]

Supply chain collaboration should not be confused with 'Operational Collaboration'. Operational Collaboration is when a supplier checks in with a buying organization for example. Supplier Collaboration focuses on collaborative goals that deliver value to both the buying and selling organization.[4]

Different forms and approaches of supply chain collaboration [ edit ]

Collaborative communication [ edit ]

Collaborative communication is the contact and message transmission process among supply chain partners in terms of frequency, direction, mode, and influence strategy. Open, frequent, balanced, two-way, multilevel communications indicate close inter-firm relationships.[5]

Collaborative Execution [ edit ]

Collaborative execution is the process of executing supply chain transactions in a collaborative manner.[5] Suppliers will work with buyers to ensure the right quantity of materials is delivered in the right time as per the contract. As the purchase order goes through its life cycle of order to delivery, at each stage there needs to be a tight collaboration between the trading partners for correct and efficient execution.

Open Supply Chain Innovation [ edit ]

Inspired by the Open Innovation approach, supply chain networks can facilitate innovation platforms where n-tier supplier chain actors and partners beyond the supply chain network can collaborate, co-create, and co-innovate. The open supply chain collaboration builds upon three ambidextrous capabilities: knowledge exploration and exploitation, horizontal and vertical collaboration, incremental and radical innovation.[6]

Coordinating contract [ edit ]

Coordinating contract is defined as a coordination mechanism that provides incentives to all of its members so that the decentralized supply chain behaves nearly or exactly the same as the integrated one, by specifying contract parameters such as quantity, price, quality and deadlines, contracts are designed to improve supplier-buyer relationship.[7]

Information sharing [ edit ]

Information sharing is the extent to which a firm shares a variety of relevant, accurate, complete, and confidential ideas, plans, and procedures with its supply chain partners in a timely manner.[8]

Joint decision making [ edit ]

Joint decision making refers to the process where supply chain partners orchestrate decisions in supply chain planning and operations that optimize supply chain benefits.[9]

Joint knowledge creation [ edit ]

Joint knowledge creation is the extent to which supply chain partners develop a better understanding of and response to the market and competitive environment by working together.[10]

Resource sharing [ edit ]

Resource sharing is the process of leveraging capabilities and assets and investing in capabilities and assets with supply chain partners.[8]",supply chain innovation partnership

CargoSense Raises $8 Million for Supply Chain Automation,https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2024/cargosense-raises-8-million-to-enhance-supply-chain-automation/,7 часов назад,"Supply chain automation firm CargoSense has raised $8 million in new funding.

The Series A round was led by Lanza techVentures and included participation from Merck Global Health Innovation Fund (MGHIF), according to a Wednesday (June 12) press release.

The company said the new funding will help it expand its partner network of integrated management systems, data sources, and industrial Internet of Things (IoT) platforms available to digital agents running on the CargoSense Visibility operating system.

“This will empower CargoSense’s global customers with the tools to automate and simplify additional aspects of their supply chain operations,” the company said in the release.

“The freight tech landscape continues to grow, and so have the complexities involved with incorporating new innovations into the technology stacks that supply chain teams depend on.”

Among those teams is one at pharmaceutical giant Merck, which worked with CargoSense to automate analysis of its parcel program to catch delivery problems in real time, and optimize decisions around distribution and packaging at the individual parcel level.

The results of this effort, the release said, led to the MGHIF investment in CargoSense to help automate supply chains throughout the pharmaceutical industry.

“Buyers of visibility data and related supply chain technologies for manufacturers and distributors all share an expectation: that it will reduce workloads for their supply chain teams,” said CargoSense founder and CEO Richard Kilmer.

“The reality is frequently the opposite, where there’s a large gap between new technology and their day-to-day operations, and people bridge the gap with additional manual effort and process complexity.”

PYMNTS looked at efforts to update supply chain models earlier this year, noting that they often rely on manual processes and disjointed communication, causing them to struggle to keep up with the demands of 2024’s dynamic markets.

“Recognizing this gap, businesses are increasingly turning to advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), automation and blockchain to transform and modernize every aspect of their supply chain processes,” that report said.

And in an interview with PYMNTS, GreyOrange CEO Akash Gupta shed light on how these advanced technologies, including robotics, AI and what he termed “an intelligent software orchestration layer,” have been instrumental in streamlining warehousing and fulfillment processes, while efficiently managing inventory flow and data.

He pointed to this company’s AI-driven platform, which he said models optimal decisions and outcomes to ensure seamless workflow management, and its single-view format for inventory nodes, providing visibility and control of the entire supply chain network.

“You’re getting a holistic view of what’s happening in the network,” Gupta said, “rather than looking at a bunch of Excel files … and it helps the interaction between sales managers and warehouse managers.”

"USDA, FFAR Launch Innovation Challenge to Catalyze ...",https://www.foodmanufacturing.com/supply-chain/news/22912415/usda-ffar-launch-innovation-challenge-to-catalyze-agricultural-solutions,20 часов назад,"WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research (FFAR) today launched a global challenge to advance scientific research that will produce major breakthroughs for nutrition security while mitigating climate change impacts and advancing equity for underserved communities. The “Nourishing Next Generation Agrifood Breakthroughs” (Innovation Challenge) funding opportunity will fund transdisciplinary teams led by early-career scientists (those who have received a Ph.D. within the past ten years) to catalyze new discoveries and mobilize transformative research that simultaneously tackle our most important societal challenges.

This competitive Innovation Challenge will spark high-risk, high-reward research through innovations at the intersection of nutrition security, equity and justice, and climate-smart agriculture. With a focus on the next generation of research, this opportunity emphasizes providing resources to support highly creative and highly promising early-career researchers. USDA and FFAR will award up to $2 million to successful applicants across multiple teams who propose a compelling vision for how their research can support sustainable food production, promote human health, and reduce inequities while enhancing real-world nutrition security.

Secretary Vilsack made the announcement during Harvesting Hope: USDA’s Agrifood Innovation Symposium, an interactive, science-focused event at the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium in Washington, D.C. The Symposium, hosted in partnership with FFAR, featured innovation showcases and lightning talks on transformative scientific solutions made possible by USDA investments to enhance collective efforts towards a more nutritious, sustainable, and equitable agrifood system.

The Innovation Challenge invites eligible researchers from domestic and international higher education institutions, non-profit and for-profit organizations, and government-affiliated research agencies to propose projects that advance disruptive approaches and technologies in alignment with USDA’s Science & Research Strategy, 2023 - 2026: Cultivating Scientific Innovation (S&RS) and FFAR’s Research Strategy. Climate, nutrition security and equity are often seen and addressed as three distinct challenges, but this new Innovation Challenge asks teams to see these problems as interconnected. The $1 million share of funding USDA is providing for this opportunity comes from funding Congress appropriated to the Office of the Chief Scientist.

Innovation Challenge applications are due Monday, July 29, 2024. For more information about the Challenge and to start the application process, you may visit the following page: USDA/FFAR Innovation Challenge page. You may also view the Zoom registration page to register to attend the June 13, 2024, USDA/FFAR webinar for prospective applicants that will offer detailed information about the application and selection process.

The Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research (FFAR) builds public-private partnerships to fund bold research addressing big food and agriculture challenges. FFAR was established in the 2014 Farm Bill to increase public agriculture research investments and complement the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s research agenda. FFAR’s model matches federal funding from Congress with private funding, delivering a powerful return on taxpayer investment. Through collaboration and partnerships, FFAR advances actionable science benefiting farmers, consumers, and the environment.",supply chain innovation partnership

Reducing post-harvest food loss and waste is a major sustainability challenge in low- and middle-income countries, some of which are major agrarian economies supplying global value chains. However, there is insufficient research in this field even today.

A new study published in Supply Chain Management: An International Journal by the University of Eastern Finland and international partners found that developing sustainable business models that are multi-actor networked for integrating them with agricultural innovation systems initiatives can enable a systemic approach for reducing food loss and value loss at the post-harvest stage.

The study was carried out in India, which is an emerging economy and has food loss challenges in the post-harvest supply chain. Data was collected through multiple rounds of field work, interviews, and focus groups over four years. The study participants were several value chain actors with long experience of working in the agri-food supply chain with multiple stakeholders (both public and private) at the local and regional level.

It was found that the challenges faced in the current business model led to losses that happened through cumulative effects, hampering everyday value creation. The experiences of the actors facing these losses tell us what kinds of strategies are needed for transitioning to a networked sustainable business model, which need to be aligned with agricultural innovation systems initiatives for reducing the multiplier and stacking losses.

""The study offers a framework for enabling agri-sector practitioners, agri-innovation entrepreneurs, and regional authorities in their aim at reducing food loss and waste at early stages of the agri-food supply chain and value chain, which is the first step towards a regenerative economy in the sector,"" says Postdoctoral Researcher Subhanjan Sengupta from the University of Eastern Finland.

It was found that a sustainable business model at the ground-level for reducing food loss would mean moving from being a single-actor-centric business model to a multi-actor-networked business model in the agri-food value chain.

The actors in control need to re-organize the supply chain by including actors that are small and informal, and re-align themselves with increased interconnectedness for operationalizing food systems innovations.

The institutional implications of the study are crucial as the small- and medium-sized actors are affected most by the loss of food and value but have lesser agency in bringing systemic change.

""We offer future researchers a set of testable propositions and future research questions to explore this topic further, in different country contexts, and contribute to developing business-oriented and innovative solutions to the problem,"" Subhanjan Sengupta further adds.

The broker said its recent survey of 1,000 U.S. business owners showed 80% are worried their business insurance will not cover a specific event or loss. The same percentage said their business had experienced financial growth over the last 12 months

Ninety-one percent of respondents identified extreme weather conditions or natural disasters as the top threat that could impact their business.

More than two thirds, 69%, said they’re concerned about the impact of a cyberattack on their business, despite the fact that only 32% of business owners surveyed have cyber coverage, Gallagher said.

Almost the same proportion, 68%, expressed “extreme concern” about supply chain disruptions and how they could affect their business.

Election year jitters ranked fourth, with 63% of respondents “very concerned” about the election results affecting their business.

Increasing concerns about their business and growth have led 96% of owners to put risk management strategies or practices in place.

Even with their concerns about technology, 81% of business owners are looking to maintain or even increase their investments in artificial intelligence this year, and half of those are looking to the technology to bolster their IT capabilities.

Meanwhile, business owners also see risks associated with deploying technology, with 37% concerned about exposing sensitive information and 35% about regulatory risks. Thirty-five percent said they fear tech may make their work obsolete.",supply chain innovation partnership

Maritime Master Plan,https://maritiemland.nl/en/maritime-master-plan/,N/A,"Maritime Master Plan for a future-oriented maritime sector

The maritime sector is extremely broad: from ports to offshore, from fishing to shipping and from maritime research institutes to maritime services. But the sector has one common denominator: ships. These are essential for transport, food production, coastal protection, and defense. In addition, they play a fundamental role in the generation of renewable energy at sea.

The Maritime Master Plan focuses on the development, construction, and operation of climate-neutral ships. By investing in this now, the Netherlands can bridge the gap between R&D and broad market upscaling, thereby strengthening and expanding its international competitive position in four strategic markets: coastal and inland shipping, hydraulic engineering, offshore wind, and maritime safety and security.

The Maritime Master Plan aims to develop, build and use 40 reliable and competitive climate-neutral demonstration ships for this purpose. In doing so, the plan kickstarts the energy transition of the maritime sector in the Netherlands, boosts the Dutch economy and invests in the maritime autonomy of the Netherlands and Europe.

Why do we need the Maritime Master Plan?

Energy Transition

International shipping (national and international) is responsible for 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, including CO2. This makes shipping one of the fastest growing causes of CO2 emissions, thereby contributing to climate change. Shipping causes emissions of 1076 million tons of CO2 on an annual basis. If shipping was a country, it would be the fifth largest polluter in the world. To achieve the climate objectives and keep our planet habitable, emissions, including from shipping, must be drastically reduced.

In numbers:

The Maritime Master Plan contributes to the reduction of 230 billion tons of CO2 until 2050 and thus a healthier environment for everyone.

Autonomy

The Netherlands needs a strong national maritime sector to protect its own public interests: a reliable (climate-neutral) energy supply, transport and (coastal) defense. This is especially important in times of rising geopolitical tensions. As a member of the European Union, the Netherlands must contribute to European strategic autonomy. Therefore, it is

essential that the country has the knowledge and skills to develop, build and operate climate-neutral ships. This ensures independence from countries outside Europe.

Economy

Internationally, the maritime energy transition is still in its infancy. Thanks to its leading maritime ecosystem The Netherlands is in an excellent starting position to become a leader in this transition. In doing so, we gain market share in four promising value chains:

coastal and inland shipping;

hydraulic engineering;

offshore wind;

maritime safety and security

In numbers:

According to economic analyses, the Maritime Master Plan provides an additional added value of 33 to 40 billion euros by 2050. The number of ships built in the Netherlands will double in the same period from approximately 80 to about 160 ships per year.

How does the Maritime Master Plan achieve this?

Forty demonstration ships

The plan focuses on the development, construction, and operation of forty demonstration ships that run on three alternative fuels: hydrogen, methanol, and LNG with carbon capture. These vessels will be used in coastal and inland shipping, hydraulic engineering, offshore wind, and maritime safety and security.

Digital platform

The processes of developing, constructing, and operating the demonstration ships are supported by a digital platform on which data is shared and stored. This platform ensures effective cooperation in the value chain and allows partners to build on each other’s progress. Gained knowledge is continuously updated on the platform. This creates a cyclical innovation process enabling efficiency gains.

In numbers:

The use of the digital platform saves up to 80% engineering hours and reduces development lead time by 50%. This will eventually reduce the cost of ships leading to a more competitive Dutch maritime manufacturing industry.

Human Capital program

The Human Capital program aims to increase the labor productivity of the maritime workforce. The digital skills in the sector are strengthened by using the digital platform. Employees are trained and develop their knowledge of climate-neutral shipping. People are also optimally prepared for the labor market of the future through targeted research into new work and management processes as well as lifelong learning.

In numbers:

Without intervention, the expectation is that the number of students in maritime education will drop by approximately 13% over 10 years. This concerns both the design and manufacturing industry as well as the operational professions on board. If maritime education is not stimulated, it is expected that in 2030 there will be a labor shortage of approximately 6,000 people in the maritime labor market.

The investment in the Maritime Master Plan

To realize the total added value of 33 to 40 billion euros, the initial investment amounts to 1.1 billion euros. Of this, approximately 926 million euros will be financed by public and private partners. A contribution from the National Growth Fund is requested for the remaining 255 million euros. This contribution is necessary to address three bottlenecks:

Climate-neutral energy systems are more complex than the current systems and not yet reliable enough. Ships are unique and often too large and expensive to first build a prototype to test innovations. Information is not shared efficiently enough, and the cooperation potential is insufficiently exploited. The supply of alternative fuels is limited because of a lack of demand. Climate-neutral ships must first be built to create that demand

Solving these three bottlenecks is expensive and involves risks. As a result, private enterprises cannot obtain sufficient financing. With a contribution from the National Growth Fund, the risks can be spread, and the costs shared. This will allow the maritime energy transition to proceed quickly.",shipping technology investment
Information technology for competitive advantage within ...,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/transe/v99y2017icp14-33.html,Автор: A Gunasekaran,"This paper offers a systematic review of the literature on the use of information technology (IT) in logistics and supply chain management to achieve competitive advantage.

The Future of Transportation Management Systems (TMS),https://activantcapital.com/research/tms,N/A,"Introduction

Since their introduction more than 50 years ago, Transportation Management System (TMS) software has grown to become a mission-critical component enabling the worldwide movement of goods. Your most recent grocery haul and new home exercise equipment, along with your business’ purchase of everything from office supplies to raw materials and inventory was made possible by a TMS. Over the years, TMSs have grown in size and scale, and have permeated all of the steps in the supply chain. Yet despite their ubiquity, we believe that today’s TMSs simply aren’t enough. They are old and legacy, don’t serve the mid-market or smaller customers efficiently, are missing key features, and often create more pain points and clumsy workarounds than the number of business problems they solve.

But we believe that is changing – largely because compelling new logistics tech companies are entering the market. In this article, we offer an overview and history of the category, as well as two frameworks to understand the product and distribution of TMSs and how to think about the emerging vendors. Throughout our research, we asked ourselves: does a next generation TMS even need to be a TMS at all? Some of today’s most compelling new vendors might offer their own TMS or TMS-like features but are agnostic as to whether you use them for that or not. Their real value-add is sitting on top of existing TMS systems and leveraging data created to offer compelling new insights and actions.

Setting the Stage

What is a TMS, and why should we even care what generation we’re on? A TMS is a software platform that tracks the physical movement of goods from point A to point B – everything from planning which carrier to use and at what rate, to tendering and executing the shipment, to tracking the load’s progress, to settlement and analysis after delivery.

A TMS is a mission-critical, system-of-record workflow software that drives revenues and manages expenses in a logistics industry that can be cyclical, competitive, and low-margin. Generally, all key parties involved in the supply chain – including shipper, carrier, freight forwarder, and broker – have their own version of a TMS to support their differentiated role in the movement of goods. The TMS is used daily by anyone in these organizations that help manage freight.

Ultimately the promise of a TMS – its stated value proposition – is to optimize a business’ transportation operations. Through centralized planning and data, and improved execution and tracking, an effective TMS can provide clear visibility and analysis of freight shipments. This leads to fewer disruptions and delays, better use of resources, and improved profitability.

It’s of little surprise that the TMS market is large and growing, with analysts projecting 15% to 19% annual growth through the rest of the decade to reach a market size of between $31B to $45B globally. TMS adoption is also high. According to recent industry surveys, 90% of carriers with more than 20 trucks and 68% of brokers use a TMS. Overall, 61% of logistics professionals, irrespective of firm size, use some form of TMS today, vs. 15% in 2005.

$45B Projected TMS Market Size by 2030

TMSs have created an incredible amount of value to date. Today, the leading providers have valuations in the tens of billions on hundreds of millions or more of revenue.

History

But today’s TMSs are old. The leading TMS vendors were mostly founded in the 1970s and 80s, built on inflexible mainframes from suppliers like IBM. They started by digitizing manual processes and paper-based workflows. They offered basic features like planning, visibility, and execution, while centralizing shipment data. And they focused on serving the enterprise, particularly the enterprise shipper, who ultimately controlled the budget on shipping spend.

Legacy players fall into three groups:

The original supply chain management software vendors who started in the 1970s, like E2Open and Descartes; Enterprise software vendors who have expanded into logistics, like SAP and Oracle; More “recent” TMS vendors like Mercury Gate, who launched their solution in 2000, over two decades ago.

Limitations and Pain Points

Over the years, the legacy TMS options have not kept up with the needs of their customers. Incumbent solutions are challenging to use, limited in features, expensive, and slow. Their UI/UX is dated and feels ‘Web 1.0’. Implementation times and ramp-up periods are long and cumbersome.

As the supply chain grows ever more complex, customers have asked for greater functionality – such as procuring freight capacity, offering real-time visibility, extending into the warehouse, and handling multiple transportation modalities. However, TMS vendors have been unable to follow through, and meaningful gaps have emerged in their solutions. According to a recent survey, only 60% of current TMS providers offer procurement & sourcing, only 50% offer warehouse management capabilities, and visibility solutions remain surprisingly simplistic, a lot of ‘dots on a map’, as do post-shipment reporting and analytics.

In addition, the incumbents have not served the mid-market or smaller customers well. They have yet to fully adapt their offerings for the cloud in order to lower the upfront investment to smaller customers. High fees, long deployments, slow product development, and poor customer support have inhibited adoption.

Like many other software categories dominated by incumbents, the legacy players have been more focused on M&A to acquire products and customers rather than investing in R&D. This trend has been accelerating. From the end of Q1 2021 to the end of Q2 2022, there were 115 acquisitions as the leading vendors continue to roll up the industry. In the first half of 2023, CargoWise (part of WiseTech) spent nearly 6x more on M&A than on R&D (i.e., AU$ 115M on R&D vs AU$ 644M on M&A).

115 Acquisitions by leading TMS vendors from Q1'21 to Q2'22

It’s no surprise, then, that nobody likes their existing legacy TMS platform. We’ve heard complaints in nearly all of our conversations with supply chain companies and users. Everyone is on the spectrum between growing dissatisfaction to outright dislike. But remember the system-of-record nature of TMSs. Despite their issues, legacy TMS vendors have continued to dominate and claim the lion’s share of the market, simply because “nobody gets fired for buying IBM.”

The Rise of the Next Generation

But there is good news.

We see an incredible opportunity in the market to build a better TMS to address customer pain points and better serve unhappy customers, large and small. The stars have aligned for next-generation TMS vendors to gain real traction, challenge the incumbents, and build foundational businesses.

Beyond the shortcomings of the existing solutions, several more factors have helped create this opportunity:

Over the last few years, we’ve seen increasing complexity and vulnerability in the supply chain , made evident by the disruptions caused by COVID, geo-political conflicts, and big headline-grabbing events like the blockages in the Suez Canal.

Activant TMS Market Map

So, who are the emerging TMS vendors looking to take advantage of this opportunity? Introducing the Activant TMS Market Map:

Activant Capital Market Map Transportation Management Software Note that this market map is a work-in-progress. Our understanding of the market is rapidly evolving - if you have a differing view, or want to share your perspective, please reach out!

We have spent a lot of time in this category and have talked to many leading TMS vendors and their customers. Before jumping in, it’s worth stepping back and noting that there are 1500+ TMS vendors globally. To simplify this market, we have segmented the world based on key criteria, including target market and geography, tech offering, number of features, and model complexity. This resulted in 4 broad non-mutually exclusive categories: Legacy Incumbents; Specialized Tech-Natives; Cross-Stakeholder Tech-Natives; and TMS Orchestrators.

We think of the Legacy Incumbents as both the initial providers of TMS solutions and multinational enterprise software players. Their solutions are often part of a larger tech suite and face many of the challenges we’ve discussed above.

as both the initial providers of TMS solutions and multinational enterprise software players. Their solutions are often part of a larger tech suite and face many of the challenges we’ve discussed above. The Tech-Natives generally have more streamlined and flexible interfaces, which makes for a better user experience. Amongst these, the Specialized providers typically focus on a specific stakeholder in the supply chain, at least to start, offering a differentiated and richer solution to that segment. By contrast, the Cross-Stakeholder platforms focus on connecting multiple stakeholders across the supply chain.

Amongst these, the providers typically focus on a specific stakeholder in the supply chain, at least to start, offering a differentiated and richer solution to that segment. By contrast, the platforms focus on connecting multiple stakeholders across the supply chain. The Orchestrators usually integrate into and improve existing TMS solutions, whether through simplifying cross-platform communication, plugging feature gaps, or scaling across adjacent segments of the supply chain.

Back to the Basics: Product and Distribution

Now armed with our Market Map, we want to double click on the interesting categories and companies to help emerging TMS vendors think about how to tactically approach the market and grow their business. We believe every TMS vendor should be thinking about two major considerations: (1) product features, and (2) distribution approaches. We highlight these approaches to building product, tied together by our TMS Features Pyramid framework below, and discuss three approaches to distribution.

The Activant Product Pyramid

Our Product Pyramid framework presents how to think about the various products and features that a TMS can offer:

Activant Capital Framework TMS Product Pyramid

At the bottom of the pyramid, Core features include optimizing loads, identifying and selecting the best carriers and routes, shipment tracking through connectivity and communication, settlement, and reporting, and analysis. These are the basic tools to get shipments from A to B.

In the middle layer, Advanced features deliver improved forecasting, planning, management, and automation for users. They address the demand for increased resilience, globalization, and sustainability.

Finally, at the top of the pyramid, Orchestrator features include making better use of large data sets, usually with artificial intelligence and machine learning, as well as deeper integrations with other systems to enable automated changes, transactions, and execution to reduce humans-in-the-loop. These features are still less common, though many vendors are actively building and refining them.

The Orchestrators

Supply chain software vendors focused on the top of the pyramid are looking to be the intelligence or orchestration layer. They usually don’t offer a TMS, and instead look to integrate with a customers’ existing TMS vendors to generate insights that the TMSs themselves don’t have and can’t offer. In doing so, they provide the final layer of features required to elevate a TMS to the next generation, but they do so without providing a TMS themselves – hence the next-gen TMS may not be a TMS. This segment is tied to the ""Orchestrators"" segment in our Activant TMS Market Map.

The primary benefit of this approach is to simplify a customer’s fragmented supply chain tech stack, allowing for a ‘single pane of glass’ to monitor and control everything. There isn’t a need to replace entrenched incumbents, minimizing cost and disruption, as well as shortening sales cycles. However, these solutions are not typically the system of record – relegating that task to the legacy TMS – and this could reduce the overall stickiness of the platform.

Logixboard enables previously analog freight forwarders and carriers to become competitive digital freight players. They provide a white label solution for their customers, while taking care of all the back-end integrations and functionality. A big plus and driver of adoption is the ease with which they can integrate the TMSs of their customer's shippers.

Pando has developed their TMS product over the past five years, to what is now their Fulfilment Cloud. This delivers an AI-powered no-code platform with end-to-end collaboration from shipper to customer. In addition to providing many of the solutions expected of a next-gen TMS, their products attempt to unlock customer benefits like new GTM channels, circular economy and ESG solutions, digitization, manufacturing innovation, supply chain integrations for M&A, etc.

Optimal Dynamics is a leading innovator in automated decision-making for freight management. They integrate into existing TMS systems and build digital twins of a supply chain network, thus aiding decision-making by predicting loads to increase the probability of being profitable. Our discussions with clients and experts suggest their solution is highly accurate and offers significant depth and breadth of information.

Leaf Logistics is the ‘air traffic control’ that sits agnostically on top of multiple TMSs. Their two main products are Flex and Adapt. Flex helps shippers identify future transport needs and locks in carriers at fixed rates to ensure consistent demand and lower costs. Adapt is a shipper software monitoring timeliness, savings, and sustainability. The company also plans to launch Pay to help pay LSPs in 30 vs 120 days.

ISO.io is a performance management solution. By mapping internal & customer SLAs and aggregating data from a company’s TMS, ERP, and other core systems. ISO.io benchmarks and identifies discrepancies to generate carrier scorecards. ISO then allows carriers to refute a claim, which often translates to real dollars in carrier’s pockets. Additionally, this data is available to the whole organization, breaking down silos between transport, sales, finance, and customer service.

As technology enables better visibility in this industry, focusing on multiple stakeholders and systems to orchestrate the flow of data is key."" Julian Alvarez, Founder & CEO, Logixboard

The Vertical Approach

Companies with a vertical focus are building solutions for a specific segment (e.g. customer type, part of the value chain, modality, or business model). Nonetheless, they can evolve to serve more segments over time. This segment ties most closely to the ""Specialized Tech-Natives"" segment in our Activant TMS Market Map.

Specific problems are more easily addressed by specialized solutions, allowing for a quicker and cheaper GTM strategy, as well as easier upsell opportunities. They are more effective at solving market-specific needs, which makes them valuable for companies growing beyond ‘off the shelf’ standard solutions. The biggest drawbacks could be a smaller addressable market, limited diversification potential, and subsequent niche concentration risk. Companies to highlight:

MyCarrier started out as offering a TMS to SMBs who needed to ship LTL (less than truckload). By partnering with many LTL carriers, they serve shippers, who can more easily connect and automate shipment execution. They are now expanding into ERP order integration and freight audit.

Exo Freight focuses on the open-deck shipping segment . Their own, or clients internal, shipper-focused TMSs combine with a carrier management portal to provide an extensive marketplace and network.

Cargoful is a next-generation TMS enabling E2E (end-to-end) order management for carriers. A differentiator is their use of machine learning and operations-research tech to support long haul, last mile, and urban delivery.

The Whole Shebang

“The Whole Shebang” approach is exactly what it sounds like – the construction of an entire TMS from the ground up. Naturally, building from the ground up requires significantly more time and invested capital than either of the other to Product approaches, but in replacing the incumbent TMS, these players will enjoy a hire stickiness than pure Orchestrators. However, success also requires (1) clear product market fit, (2) the flexibility to tailor the product to multiple stakeholders and (3) the ability to overcome the stickiness of the incumbents.

To our knowledge, the only player currently exploring this route is Mastery Logistics Systems. They are building an enterprise-level platform which attempts to roll up all customers’ (initially carriers & brokers) existing TMSs and functionality, irrespective of mode.

Building a TMS from scratch is really ******* hard, which is why it’s worth doing! Nobody has been able to build a TMS in decades that provides the whole solution for the enterprise – we are uniquely capable of delivering what the industry badly needs."" Jeff Silver, Co-Founder & CEO, Mastery

Distribution

While Product remains an axis we use to index companies, we have found Distribution strategy to be an equally compelling tool for segmentation. Here, we highlight three notable approaches to distribution that we have consistently seen from current TMS vendors. Our Distribution graphic below captures these strategies and illustrates how the core offering starts near the center but then grows outwards into untapped markets.

Multiple Stakeholders

These vendors aim to provide solutions for different stakeholders (e.g. shippers, carriers, brokers, forwarders, 3PLs, NVOCCs). They often start with one key relationship, which in turn generates a client-driven cross-sell. The strength of these products is in their cross-sell potential, which in turn can lead to network effects between stakeholders. However, in building for multiple parties, this approach risks creating misaligned incentives in product-market fit – where multiple parties have different product requirements. This segment ties most closely to the ""Cross-Stakeholder Tech-Natives"" segment in our Activant TMS Market Map.

FreightPop provides a TMS with a comprehensive feature set that addresses a wide range of stakeholders (from manufacturers to 3PLs). Notably, they provide rate shopping, freight visibility, freight planning, and freight audit.

Rose Rocket offers a TMS with a menu of integrations that allow their clients to quickly automate and connect data internally and, importantly, across their network of customers, drivers, and partners.

Turvo, an Activant portfolio company that is now part of Lineage Logistics, was one of the early next-gen TMS companies. It was built on the premise of collaboration by breaking down the walls between different stakeholders, systems, and processes.

Pallet, an Activant Portfolio company, offers an integrated platform that combines a Transportation Management System (TMS), a Warehouse Management System (WMS) and a Billing System. Over time, the company also plans to build and integrate an Order Management System (OMS). This unified SaaS platform becomes the “Operating System” for 3PLs that eliminates the need for customers to reinput data across multiple siloed platforms that individually accomplish a segment of the solution.

Alternative Monetization

These vendors use their TMS as a wedge into a customer and monetize indirectly (but not with TMS fees). So, the TMS might be almost free and then revenues are generated via alternate embedded products or monetizing different stakeholders. Obviously, it is hard to beat free, which also shortens sales cycles. Additionally, new technology makes it easier to embed solutions, and there is greater potential to align incentives with customers. A drawback could be a perception of a less valuable product, with customers wondering ""what's the catch?"" MVMNT offers their TMS for a minimal cost and monetize via financial services tools like factoring, and insurance which allows SMB brokers to become more attractive & competitive.

MVMNT offers their TMS for a minimal cost and monetize via financial services tools like factoring, and insurance which allows SMB brokers to become more attractive & competitive.

Emerge uses their (essentially free) TMS to provide dynamic RFPs to shippers. This in turn attracts carriers to their marketplace – from which they monetize based on transactions.

Zuum provides a free TMS which integrates to their digital freight marketplace. In doing so, they enable all stakeholders to effectively become digital brokers and capture capacity, carriers and data.

Land & Expand

Somewhat like Orchestrators, these vendors have created solutions that aren’t typical TMSs, but enhance their functionality. The strength of these products is in their speed to market and shortened sales cycle. Furthermore, they offer classic ‘land and expand’ opportunities (both within a customer and across the value chain). However, they carry the risk of being perceived as a point solution initially.

Leverage.ai promises one platform that easily integrates into existing systems, providing end-to-end visibility across the entire supply chain lifecycle. We like the customization, flexibility, and scalability – all of which we think are necessary for a next-gen TMS solution.

Conclusion

We’re excited about the next five years – the next 50 years even – for TMS. There will always be physical goods to move, and there will always need to be systems to enable that. We’re eager to see what those new systems will look like, and what the leading next-generation TMS vendors are already building today. And if we’re right, many of those next-gen TMS’s won’t need to be a TMS at all!",shipping technology investment

Shipping Technology Startups May Get Boost From Hanjin Woes,https://www.ttnews.com/articles/shipping-technology-startups-may-get-boost-hanjin-woes,N/A,"jgmorard/Flickr

SINGAPORE — The global shipping industry, ravaged by collapsing revenues, defensive mergers and the failure of major player South Korea's Hanjin Shipping Co. slowly is waking up to the redeeming potential of technology.

While sensor-laden containers, smart ships and 3D printing have grabbed the headlines, the startups making the biggest inroads are those working on something more basic — streamlining the interaction among shippers, freight forwarders and those actually transporting the goods.

""This is way up there on the list of insanely complex systems with enormous impact on the global economy,"" said Trae Stephens of Founders Fund, which this week led a $65 million investment round in Flexport, a startup focusing on providing logistics services and data.

RELATED: McLeod CEO sees opportunities in ‘uncertain times’

""We believe doing this in a more efficient way can really move the needle on every part of the economy,"" said Stephens, who will join Flexport's board as part of the investment round.

Container ocean trade is likely to grow no more than 3% over the next few years — at a compound annual growth rate — compared to 10% in 2000 to 2005 and 5% in 2005 to 2010, according to Seabury, a transportation consultancy, and McKinsey predicts shipping oversupply will stay above 20% this year and next.

Zvi Schreiber, CEO of Freightos, a Hong Kong startup that offers Expedia-like quotes for end-to-end freight shipping, says the shipping industry is ""manual, inefficient and opaque.""

RELATED: Hanjin clients report price-gouging, container pileups

KPMG found that a quotation for shipping freight typically involved 20 associated fees and, according to the Journal of Commerce, shippers each lose up to $150,000 a year when price volatility and staffing cuts force invoicing errors.

""This industry is broken, there's no question we have a serious issue,"" Jesper Kjaedegaard, partner at shipping and logistics firm Mercator International, said at a recent shipping conference in Singapore. ""Without technology, this industry is not going to move much further.""

Kjaedegaard pointed to startups such as Xeneta, set up by two industry veterans after they failed to persuade their employer, shipping giant Kuehne + Nagel, to introduce greater transparency into rates charged.

RELATED: Freightos acquires WebCargoNet to expand instant freight quotes

""Transparency is viewed by a lot of people in the industry as destructive in that it would negatively affect margins,"" co-founder Thomas Sorbo said.

Xeneta's solution was drawn from the world of consumer startups: Encourage all those in the industry to contribute rates, creating a crowdsourced database of some 17 million contracted sea-freight rates worldwide.

By providing real-time data, shippers can see what they should be paying.

""Suddenly, [they] can compare their contracts with others and find out if they're being ripped off,"" Sorbo said.

Venture capital interest in the broad supply chain and logistics industry has been growing, at least until last year. In 2015, consultancy CB Insights counted more than $1.7 billion of investment in startups, triple that in 2014. An additional $500 million or so was invested in the first half of this year.

Startups range from those trying to Uber-ize the industry to those like Natilus, which plans a Boeing 777-size cargo drone which lands and takes off in water. CEO Aleksey Matyushev envisions a world where the cost of transporting goods by air could do away with a lot of the ocean-bound shipping, which accounts for around 98% of container freight, according to Seabury.

But, for now, it's startups such as Xenetas, nibbling away at the industry's inefficiencies that are making waves.

Freightos, for example, provides software that allows logistics firms to manage contracts and automate the quotation and sales process. Last month, it bought WebCargoNet, a Spanish network of air cargo rates.

GT Nexus, which allows shippers to manage their supply chain online, was bought last year by Infor, one of the world's largest software companies.

Not everyone in the industry is happy with the attention and question whether such startups will be able to carve out much more than a niche.

""They think they've reinvented the wheel, and they haven't,"" said Nick Coverdale, a Hong Kong-based industry veteran. The industry ""is not as backward as people claim.""

But he acknowledged that technology could play a role and pointed to a service he will launch next month. It would enable freight buyers to choose a sailing online and agree to a deal in seconds.

Others have noticed the benefits of embracing such services.

Eddie Soh of Singapore-based Global Air Cargo International, said using Freightos allows him to give a customer a quote quickly, even if he's on the road, just by pulling out his iPad.

Previously, he said, that involved going back to the office and trawling through e-mails and Excel spreadsheets.",shipping technology investment

Peel Ports to use satellites for safer shipping,https://www.drycargomag.com/peel-ports-to-use-satellites-for-safer-shipping,1 день назад,"A UK-first collaboration is set to use satellites to monitor coastal changes in a bid to create safer shipping navigation channels.

The project will see Peel Ports, the UK’s second largest port operator, partner with the National Oceanography Centre (NOC) and Channel Coastal Observatory (CCO) to employ satellite surveillance and assess where maintenance is needed over a six-month period.

Funded by UK Space Agency Small Business Research (SBRI), the NOC will use its patented coastal mapping technology to support Peel Ports in building targeted dredging operations across the Mersey and Medway estuaries.

Offering greater insight into changes to the marine environments around two of the UK’s most important waterways, Peel Ports will use the data to ensure safer access to the Port of Liverpool and Port of Medway for arriving ships.

Traditionally, marine observation and maintenance is carried out using environmental surveys and annual dredging programmes, which come at high cost and provide limited data.

However, using the coastal mapping capabilities developed by the NOC’s Dr Paul Bell and Clive Neil, Peel Ports will be more informed with accessible data which maps marine features, including challenging intertidal areas that see the most changes.

As a result, Peel Ports will be able to identify issues and take action quicker and more effectively than before.

Gary Doyle, Group Harbour Master at Peel Ports Group, said: “Like any statutory harbour authority, we have a duty to provide accurate timely navigational information . Understanding the dynamics across our sites, and publishing accurate information, is vitally important to us and all those who rely on the waterways under our responsibility.

“We are constantly evaluating new technologies and this project will provide information on adding an additional flexible asset to our inventory. It will also allow us to assess what impact it will have in support of our marine decarbonisation plan. .”

Christine Sams, Head of Research Engagement, NOC: “This collaboration is something that has never been done in the UK before and we are excited to provide valuable insight into the areas in which Peel Ports operates in.

“Not only will it give them a comprehensive overview of the Mersey and Medway estuaries, but it will also support Peel Ports to develop proactive dredging and maintenance strategies which will deliver a safer shipping environment for everyone.”

Charlie Thompson, Director, CCO: said: “Using satellites is an evolution on traditional survey methods with the potential to bring unparalleled data that can inform the actions required when reviewing coastal maintenance of challenging intertidal areas.

“We’re looking forward to supporting Peel Ports and the NOC to deliver this project.”

The SBRI’s funding for the project came from its Unlocking Space for Business initiative, which offers applicants a share of £2m to combine terrestrial technologies with satellite data for transport, logistics, and financial services.",shipping technology investment

What is cleantech?,https://www.cleantechforeurope.com/explainers/what-is-cleantech,N/A,"According to the IEA, more than half of the cumulative emission reductions necessary to shift to a net-zero economy path come from technologies that are still not commercially available. Scaling up clean technology is therefore a crucial objective in the race to net zero. However, industrial scale-up takes time and significant investment. Some clean technologies, like solar and wind, are now fully mature and at cost parity with incumbent technologies such as coal or natural gas. Others, like floating offshore wind or green steel, still have a ""green premium"" compared to incumbent technology, and need further support to scale.



Clean technologies can have a long lead time to commercialisation, which may not be suited to the traditional venture capital model of 5-year cycles. Public policy has an important role to play to de-risk these investments, create demand for clean technologies and phase out incumbent technology.

18 October 2022. The team of bpv GRIGORESCU STEFANICA advised Innoship Technology, its co-founders and the investor Gapminder VC, in relation to the investment by Alsendo Group, an Abris Capital portfolio company.

The transaction was completed in October 2022 and sees Alsendo Group becoming a majority shareholder in the company, with the co-founders retaining the remaining shareholding. Venture capital investor Gapminder VC, a leading venture capital fund investing in technology companies, has exited its investment. The co-founders will continue to run and expand the business of Innoship throughout Europe, while taking additional responsibilities at the level of Alsendo Group.

Our team advised comprehensively on all stages of the transaction and was led by Cătălin Grigorescu, Partner (Corporate, M&A, Technology). Cătălin will continue to support Innoship and its business as a member of the newly-formed Supervisory Board.

Our firm advised Innoship and its co-founders since the company’s initial set-up in 2019 on all corporate, commercial, employment and regulatory matters. In 2020, we advised on Innoship’s seed financing round from GapMinder VC, which accelerated the growth of the business and the technological development of the Innoship platform.

Cătălin Grigorescu, Managing Partner bpv GRIGORESCU ȘTEFĂNICĂ: Witnessing Innoship’s impressing success story first-hand and working with the co-founders and the investors throughout the entire existence of the company so far is a great professional privilege. We are grateful for the trust the co-founders and Gapminder have placed in our team to advise them in this transaction that opened a new chapter in the company’s life. The tie-up with Alsendo and the backing of Abris Capital will see the combined businesses transform into a European powerhouse for advanced technology solutions for end-to-end shipping management in the near future.

Daniel Nicolae, Managing Partner INNOSHIP: Innoship is a fast-growing, innovative company, redefining its sector and we needed advisors with the same attitude and capabilities. Catalin and bpv GRIGORESCU STEFANICA have accompanied our team since the very beginning. Their legal skills and deep roots in the technology sector as well as their outstanding business acumen were invaluable in achieving exceptional results for the company and for the founders on several occasions, including in this transaction.

Cosmin Ochisor, Partner GAPMINDER VC: Our first interaction with Innoship was an introduction made by Catalin to the co-founders and we are very happy with the investment decision we took two years ago, which led to a very profitable exit for our fund. Catalin was also instrumental in aligning all existing shareholders for in pursuing the route of a transaction with a private equity fund. Working with Catalin and his team on this transaction was a no brainer for us.

The year 2022 continues to be a highlight year for our firm’s technology transactions practice.

Wind Propulsion (WP) & Wind Assist Shipping Projects ...,https://www.wind-ship.org/en/wind-propulsion-wp-wind-assist-shipping-projects-wasp/,N/A,"The use of wind propulsion in modern commercial shipping covers a wide spectrum – from wind-assisted motor vessels, where auxiliary propulsion is provided by wind to primary wind ships with auxiliary engines, where primary propulsion is from the wind, augmented by engines to ensure just-in-time schedules are maintained .

Motor Vessels – The standard vessels that make up the vast majority of the current world fleet of ocean going vessels. Improvements in efficiency and savings in fuel costs and emissions have been achieved by increasing the size of vessels, improving hull design, increased engine efficiency and other modifications and to a limited extent by the use of renewable energy options for ancillary power. Operational changes have also been made, especially slow steaming, with reductions in speed to c.18knots and super slow steaming (14-16 knots). This slow steaming approach is especially effective for bulk cargos being delivered without tight time constraints, however slow steaming is less attractive when oil (bunker prices) drop.

Wind-Assisted Motor Vessels – primarily employing auxiliary-wind propulsion systems retrofitted onto existing vessels. These systems offer fuel savings in the 10-30% range, with lower initial retro-fit investment costs than new build options. The addition of these systems can also have other benefits such as reduced engine and machinery wear and tear, improved stability, reduction in vibration etc.)

Hybrid Wind/Motor Vessels – these designs combine fuel and emissions reduction benefits of wind propulsion options with the capabilities and performance of motor vessels allowing predictable scheduling. In favorable winds savings can be in excess of 60-70%, in less accommodating conditions vessels use a mix of wind/motor propulsion or motor alone. With good weather routing and handling, new build sailing hybrid vessels are defined as offering fuel savings on an annual basis of over 50%.

Purely Wind Vessel (+Auxiliary Motor) – these vessels can deliver up to 100% savings, with standard maintenance costs etc. however the challenge of maintaining schedules and being susceptible to weather conditions is an important consideration. Some routes will obviously be more favourable to this type of vessel and operation.

Weather Routing – The development of increasingly reliable weather/wind routing software helps to both predict, plan and operationally adjust sailing routes to maximize the benefits from wind and minimize the disruption from adverse weather conditions.

How Is China Influencing Global Maritime Connectivity?,https://chinapower.csis.org/china-ports-connectivity/,N/A,"Decades of economic growth and government prioritization have enabled China to position itself at the nexus of global maritime trade. Enhanced maritime connectivity has generated considerable economic benefits for China and offered Beijing greater influence over the flow of goods around the world. Chinese leaders are pushing to leverage the nation’s resources to further strengthen connectivity, with a key emphasis on enhancing port infrastructure.

China’s World-Leading Ports

The rapid rise of China’s economy on the world stage has largely been fueled by decades of surging exports. With roughly 80 percent of global trade moving by sea, tapping into maritime shipping networks has been central to China’s strategy of export-led economic development.

To facilitate the flow of goods in and out of the country, China has developed some of the world’s largest and busiest ports. According to the Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (LSCI), which scores countries and their respective container ports based on their level of integration into established liner shipping routes, several of China’s container ports rank among the most connected in the world.

Expand to learn more about the LSCI. Jointly developed by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and MDS Transmodal, the LSCI scores more than 900 container ports around the world based on six indicators: The number of scheduled ship calls per week in the port Deployed annual capacity in twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) The number or regular liner shipping services to and from the port The number of liner shipping companies that provide services to and from the port. The average size in TEU of the ships deployed by the scheduled service with the largest average vessel size. The number of other ports that are connected to the port through direct liner shipping services. The LSCI also provides overall country scores based on equivalent indicators. Additional details about the LSCI’s methodology can be found here.

As of the first quarter (Q1) of 2021, China possesses 10 of the top 100 ports in the LSCI. That figure rises to 11 ports when including Hong Kong. Only the United States, with nine ports in the top 100, comes close to matching China. However, China’s 11 ports boast an average connectivity score of 60.6, which is significantly higher than the average score of US ports (44.5).

The World’s Most Connected Ports Share The World’s Most Connected Ports

China’s lead in maritime connectivity is even more pronounced at the national level, where the LSCI assigns an overall connectivity score for each country. In Q1 2021, China’s LSCI country score stood at 164, well ahead of other top countries, including Singapore (113), South Korea (108), the United States (106), and Malaysia (100).

Notably, China’s lead has grown over time. Its LSCI score surged nearly 64 percent from Q1 2006 to Q1 2021, while other top-five countries saw their scores grow at a slower clip (a collective average of 46 percent). The United States’ score grew the slowest – just 33 percent, or about half as fast as China’s.

Share China’s Growing Lead in Maritime Connectivity

Critical to China’s strong performance in the LSCI is its capacity to handle high container throughput, which is a measure of the amount of containerized goods processed by a port. In 2019, Chinese ports handled 242 million TEUs (twenty-foot equivalent units) worth of goods. This is considerably more than all other East Asia and Pacific countries combined (212.1 million TEUs) and more than four times higher than US throughput (55.5 million TEUs). Additionally, China’s share of global throughput rose steadily from 24.3 percent in 2010 to 29.8 percent in 2019.

The Port of Shanghai alone handled 16.6 percent of China’s total container throughput in 2019. In addition to being China’s top port, it has also reigned as the world’s busiest container port since 2010, when it eclipsed the Port of Singapore. Besides Shanghai, six other Chinese ports ranked among the 10 most-active container ports in the world in 2019, including Ningbo-Zhoushan (3rd), Shenzhen (4th), Guangzhou (5th), Qingdao (7th), Hong Kong (8th), and Tianjin (9th). The only non-Chinese ports to make it into the top 10 were Singapore (2nd), Busan (6th), and Rotterdam (10th). Unsurprisingly, all of these ports score highly in the LSCI.

Share Global Container Port Throughput

The prominence of China’s ports is not simply the result of their size. They are also more efficient than their counterparts. According to data from UNCTAD, the median time spent at Chinese ports by container vessels was 0.62 days in 2020. While that is slower than some countries, such as Japan (0.34) and Denmark (0.45), it is faster than other competitors such as Singapore (0.80) and the US (1.03). However, the size of a ship significantly determines the speed at which containers can be loaded and unloaded. Factoring in the larger size of the ships calling in China, Chinese ports are considerably more efficient than their competitors.

Efficiency of Container Ports in Select Countries (2020) Country Median Time in Port (Days) Average Capacity per Ship (TEU) Efficiency (TEU/Day)* China 0.62 4,637 7,479 Singapore 0.80 5,228 6,535 United States 1.03 5,347 5,191 Denmark 0.44 1,787 5,061 Japan 0.34 1,620 4,765 Source: UNCTAD *Calculated by dividing average capacity of ships by median time in port

Taken together, data on global port activity reveals that China stands a head above the rest when it comes to maritime shipping connectivity. Chinese ports are busier and more efficient than most of their competitors, and their lead over the rest of the world continues to widen year after year.

China’s Pursuit of Commercial Maritime Power

The success of China’s ports is founded on natural geographic advantages, but Chinese leaders have played a crucial role in developing the country’s port infrastructure.

Major maritime powers share one thing in common: access to the sea. At 14,500 kilometers (km) in length, China’s ocean shoreline is the 10th longest in the world. While countries like Canada and Russia have significantly longer shorelines (202,080 km and 37,653 km, respectively), the vast majority of China’s shoreline has the advantage of being accessible year-round. More importantly, many of China’s largest and wealthiest population centers lie along its eastern coast, which makes it more logistically and economically feasible to construct large ports.

While geography is important, the Chinese government is largely responsible for spurring the growth of Chinese ports. Leaders in Beijing have long sought to develop ports capable of feeding China’s ever-growing demand for raw materials and facilitating export-led economic growth. For example, China’s Sixth Five-Year Plan (FYP), launched in 1981, called for scaling up the capacity of major coastal and inland ports, with special attention paid to coal transport.

“Economic powers must be maritime powers and shipping powers.” Xi Jinping

In recent years, Chinese leaders have articulated a grander vision aimed at transforming China into a global maritime power capable of advancing the nation’s military and commercial interests at sea. At the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP’s) 12th Party Congress in November 2012, then-President Hu Jintao laid out the CCP’s goal for China to become a “maritime power” (haiyang qiangguo), and he called for “enhancing [China’s] capacity for exploiting marine resources” and “developing the marine economy.” President Xi Jinping has repeatedly echoed this call, emphasizing that “economic powers must be maritime powers and shipping powers.”

Beijing has backed these ambitions with heavy investments. From 2012 to 2019, the Chinese government devoted an estimated RMB 1 trillion (around $153 billion) to constructing new port facilities and upgrading existing port infrastructure. By comparison, the US government spent less than $110 billion on all water transportation infrastructure over the same period.

These investments, coupled with continued Chinese economic and trade growth, have contributed to skyrocketing activity at major Chinese ports. From 2000 to 2019, the combined freight processed by the top five Chinese ports increased nearly sixfold, from 613.3 million metric tons to almost 3.5 billion metric tons. The Port of Ningbo-Zhoushan experienced the most impressive growth. It eclipsed Shanghai in 2008 to become the world’s busiest port in terms of total freight volume, which encompasses not just containerized goods but also bulk goods (like coal and steel), liquid natural gas, and oil. Since then, Ningbo-Zhoushan’s freight volume more than doubled, from 520.5 million metric tons in 2008 to 1.12 billion metric tons in 2019.

Share Total Freight Throughput in China’s Top Five Ports

Yet growing freight volumes among the top ports belie the fact than many Chinese ports are underutilized due to poor planning. In the mid-1980s, the central government devolved responsibilities for constructing and managing ports to provincial and municipal governments, leading to a frenzy of disorderly development. Spurred by a desire to prop up local GDP growth, many officials eagerly pushed through large port construction projects in the absence of adequate commercial demand.

These problems have put pressure on Chinese authorities to integrate ports and administer them at a regional level to reduce inefficiency and wasteful construction. China’s 13th FYP, which kicked off in 2016, called for establishing “a new model of coordinated oversight over maritime affairs.” In particular, the 13th FYP sought to establish “port clusters” that would be better integrated into the overall development of three critically important economic regions: the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area in China’s northeast, the Yangtze River Delta in the east, and the Pearl River Delta in the southeast. China’s 14th FYP, issued in March 2021, echoed similar calls.

In February 2021, the CCP Central Committee and State Council also released the “National Comprehensive Three-Dimensional Transportation Network Plan,” which outlines goals to make China’s infrastructure system safer, smarter, and greener through 2035. The plan highlights the need to apply innovations like artificial intelligence and the “Internet of Things” to increase efficiency at China’s ports. It ultimately sets out the goal for China to possess 27 major coastal ports and 36 major inland river ports by 2035.

Scaling Up Global Connectivity

Beijing’s efforts to shape global maritime connectivity do not end at China’s borders. Under Xi, Chinese state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been engaging in investment and construction projects at dozens of ports around the world. The scale of China’s activities has raised questions about the potential impacts on recipient countries and the broader implications of Beijing’s growing economic influence.

At the center of many Chinese overseas port projects is the Maritime Silk Road (MSR). Launched in 2013, the MSR forms the maritime component of the broader Belt and Road Initiative – Beijing’s ambitious agenda for shoring up its global economic and political clout by enhancing connectivity between China and other countries.

As of 2020, China’s Belt and Road Initiative includes 138 countries with a combined GDP of $29 trillion and some 4.6 billion people. Learn more about the BRI and how it will advance China’s interests. Explore More.

According to one estimate, Chinese companies – primarily SOEs like China COSCO Shipping Corporation and China Merchants Group – invested nearly $11 billion into overseas ports between 2010 and 2019. Another study conducted by a team of Chinese researchers found that Chinese companies had signed deals on more than 80 port projects during the same period, including foreign direct investments, acquisitions, leasing, and construction contracts. The total value of these deals, including those not yet delivered, reached almost $70 billion.

However, many Chinese-backed projects have not taken off as planned. In Pakistan, China hailed its ongoing investments at Gwadar Port as a key component of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor – a flagship project of the BRI. Yet Gwadar Port remains heavily underutilized, forcing the Pakistani government to pursue desperate measures in early 2021 to revive the port and attract tourism to the surrounding area. The failure of Gwadar Port to meet lofty ambitions tracks with its performance in the LSCI, where the port’s score has dropped from an already low 6.1 in Q1 2019 to 4.6 in Q1 2021.

Other major projects have entirely failed to materialize. In 2013, China Merchants Holdings International signed a framework agreement with Tanzania to construct Bagamoyo Port and an accompanying special economic zone. The project, valued at $10 billion, aimed to transform Tanzania into a major East African transportation and logistics hub, but the Tanzanian government has pushed back on Chinese plans, and no construction has started as of early 2021.

In Sri Lanka, the government’s leasing of the Port of Hambantota to Chinese SOEs set off alarm bells around the world. Sri Lanka racked up more than $8 billion in total debt to Chinese SOEs over the years, including $1.1 billion to construct Hambantota Port. When the Sri Lankan government struggled to repay its debts, it agreed in 2017 to lease the port to China for 99 years in exchange for debt reduction. The move sparked concerns about Chinese economic influence and the potential risks for smaller countries of signing costly infrastructure development deals with China.

There are also persistent concerns that Chinese-built ports such as Hambantota and Gwadar could someday house facilities to support the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA). That has already happened in Djibouti, where China has constructed military facilities directly adjacent to the commercial Port of Doraleh, which China is also helping to construct. The PLA Support Base in Djibouti – China’s first overseas military base – has undergone significant improvements in recent years, which US military officials warn will allow Chinese aircraft carriers to dock there.

Other major players are engaged in port projects in the region, offering a potential counterweight to China. In March 2021, the Sri Lankan cabinet approved a deal that will allow Indian and Japanese companies to develop and operate the West Container Terminal at Colombo Port in Sri Lanka’s capital. Japan is also involved in a major project to develop new container terminals at Kenya’s Mombasa Port, the second stage of which is valued at roughly $300 million and set for completion in late 2021. While these projects could help to somewhat stave off China’s economic influence, the scale and breadth of China’s port development abroad will continue to play a major role in shaping maritime connectivity across the Indo-Pacific region and East Africa.",shipping technology investment

(SZSE:002401) were solid, but the stock didn't move as much as we expected. We believe that shareholders have noticed some concerning factors beyond the statutory profit numbers.

SZSE:002401 Earnings and Revenue History May 6th 2024

Zooming In On COSCO SHIPPING Technology's Earnings

One key financial ratio used to measure how well a company converts its profit to free cash flow (FCF) is the accrual ratio. In plain english, this ratio subtracts FCF from net profit, and divides that number by the company's average operating assets over that period. The ratio shows us how much a company's profit exceeds its FCF.

That means a negative accrual ratio is a good thing, because it shows that the company is bringing in more free cash flow than its profit would suggest. While having an accrual ratio above zero is of little concern, we do think it's worth noting when a company has a relatively high accrual ratio. That's because some academic studies have suggested that high accruals ratios tend to lead to lower profit or less profit growth.

COSCO SHIPPING Technology has an accrual ratio of 1.07 for the year to March 2024. Ergo, its free cash flow is significantly weaker than its profit. Statistically speaking, that's a real negative for future earnings. Indeed, in the last twelve months it reported free cash flow of CN¥98m, which is significantly less than its profit of CN¥190.5m. At this point we should mention that COSCO SHIPPING Technology did manage to increase its free cash flow in the last twelve months

Our Take On COSCO SHIPPING Technology's Profit Performance

As we discussed above, we think COSCO SHIPPING Technology's earnings were not supported by free cash flow, which might concern some investors. As a result, we think it may well be the case that COSCO SHIPPING Technology's underlying earnings power is lower than its statutory profit. But at least holders can take some solace from the 23% per annum growth in EPS for the last three. At the end of the day, it's essential to consider more than just the factors above, if you want to understand the company properly. If you'd like to know more about COSCO SHIPPING Technology as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for COSCO SHIPPING Technology (of which 1 is significant!) you should know about.

Freight technology,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freight_technology,N/A,"Industrial sector

The freight technology sector, also known as FreightTech, refers to software companies and technologies which assist in supply chain management and the movement of freight.[1] In the five years following 2014, investment in FreightTech companies grew from $118 million to $3 billion per year.[1][2][3]

Disruption of traditional logistics and supply chain management [ edit ]

The shipping and logistics industry has long been viewed as conservative and slow-to-change,[4] in part due to complex relationships within global shipping and transportation networks,[5][6] difficult documentation and customs requirements,[4][6][7] lack of transparency among involved parties,[7][6] and obstacles to adapting quickly to sudden economic changes.[4][5][8][6][7]

Recent developments in freight technology are working to modernize and simplify freight transport. According to a report from the U.S. Department of Transportation, intelligent freight technologies have multifaceted benefits in shipping and logistics.[9] These include increased operational flexibility and efficiency due to better planning and schedule adherence, better utilization of people and equipment, reduction of non-productive waiting times, shorter processing times, and increased shipper confidence.[9]

Transactional application programming interfaces (API)[10] and distributed ledger technology are expanding in the shipping and logistics sector to reduce extensive paperwork,[11][12][13] monitor conditions and location of freight and goods in transport and make this information available to involved parties,[11][14][12][13] and increase transparency across the supply chain.[11][12][13]

Truck freight [ edit ]

The first steps to digitization in trucking came in the form of digital freight exchanges such as Teleroute[15][16] and TIMOCOM.[17][18][15] Greater efficiency in trucking is being achieved through intelligent freight technology such as automated interfaces that can help truckers and regulatory bodies reduce stops at weigh stations and time spent at border checkpoints.[9] This improves schedule adherence, reduces administrative burdens, and increases fuel efficiency by minimizing time spent idling.[9] Mobile tracking programs can also reduce theft and loss of cargo by recording instances where trailer doors are opened outside of approved areas (geo-fences) and alerting authorities.[9] Growing automation of quoting and booking of truckload shipments and increased automation of matching trucks with appropriate loads in a timely manner is also working to maximize efficiency for shippers and consumers.[19] Vehicle tracking has been used by shipping agents and freight forwarders to monitor the location of vehicles. They can also monitor traffic information, vehicle and driver data, and other real-time freight information.[20]

Due to the relatively short life cycle of three to four years for commercial trucks,[21] implementation of new interfaces and freight technologies has progressed more quickly in trucking than in other sectors.[21] Compared with other modes of transport such as aviation and rail, however, driverless technologies for road transport have lagged behind due to road environments being more complex than separated spaces for rail and air transport.[22]

Air freight [ edit ]

Freight technology in air cargo is already critically important in cold chain management for sensitive goods such as agricultural products, vaccines, and medications.[23] Monitoring in the form of data loggers can record temperature, light, humidity, and GPS location to show whether goods have been improperly cooled, handled, or tampered with.[24][25] It is estimated that billions of dollars in revenue are lost by cargo companies annually due to dispute resolution for shipment delays and lost and damaged goods.[25]

The world’s first blockchain-based system for streamlining air cargo costing, billing, and reconciliation was announced at the 2019 IATA World Cargo Symposium.[24][26]

Rail freight [ edit ]

The Freight Technology Group, responsible for identifying relevant technologies for the freight sector in the UK, has identified three key technical innovations already in use in rail freight.[27] These include timetable advisory systems which allow drivers to track train progress against timetables via software hosted on tablets, freight collaborative decision-making systems which offer real-time information on arrivals of freight services, and mobile consisting applications which reduce the amount of information sent manually to relevant parties and authorities by collecting information and transmitting it directly.[27]

However, advancements in rail freight technology have progressed more slowly than in other sectors due to the decades-long life cycles of locomotives and railcars[21] and the lack of power supply in freight cars.[28]

A $10 billion upgrade to the North American rail system was mandated by Congress to include automated safety overrides after a 2008 commuter train accident, laying the groundwork for autonomous rails in the United States.[29]

In 2019, mining group Rio Tinto launched the world’s first autonomous heavy-haul freight railway trains in Western Australia to deliver ore from mines to ports.[30]

Sea freight [ edit ]

The growing number of smart ports around the world are increasing capacity and efficiency for shippers, ports, and freight forwarding partners, such as trucking carriers.[18] Reductions in labour and machinery costs can be seen at ports thanks to improvements in automated and semi-automated cranes, which reduce the need for yard transfer vehicles.[22]

In 2018, shipping conglomerate Maersk partnered with IBM to create TradeLens, a platform for sharing and streamlining shipping information across shipping partners, businesses, and different authorities.[11][7] By 2019, the platform covered nearly half of the world’s shipments of cargo containers.[7][31][32]

Intermodal freight [ edit ]

Freight that is shipped using multiple modes of transport is called intermodal freight.[33] Freight technology plays a pivotal role in intermodal freight transport by streamlining communication, documentation, and dispute resolution across various industry players as cargo changes hands.[33] Freight technology offers a way to increase transparency across industry players at each step of the supply chain. Smart contracts, for example, can use information collected by data loggers, such as temperature data on cold chain shipments, to resolve or dispute a contract depending on whether the agreed upon terms of shipping have been followed.[33]

"Jasper Investments volume, price surge on S$9 million ...",https://www.businesstimes.com.sg/companies-markets/jasper-investments-volume-price-surge-s9-million-investors-including-koh-boon-hwee,7 дней назад,"SHARES of watch-listed Jasper Investments quadrupled in value after the marine player secured S$9 million in capital from strategic investors, including Koh Boon Hwee, a board director of Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC.

As at 3.14 pm on Thursday (Jun 6), shares of Jasper were trading up 300 per cent, or S$0.003, to S$0.004. With 70.1 million shares changing hands, it was the top-traded counter on the Singapore Exchange (SGX).

It last closed at this level in September 2022.

Before the market opened on Thursday, the mainboard-listed company, which invests in marine and shipping activities, said that it had secured S$9 million in capital via the placement of some 6.2 billion shares tagged with 3.1 billion new free warrants.

Black Kite, whose ultimate beneficial owner is GIC’s Koh, has subscribed to about 333.3 million placement shares and 166.7 million warrants at a consideration of S$500,000. This brings the company’s shareholding in Jasper to 3 per cent of its enlarged share capital.

Jasper has also secured about S$1.5 million from Azure Capital’s chief executive officer Terence Wong, as well as the funds he manages. Of this amount, about S$500,000 was invested by Wong personally.

Azure All-Star Fund invested about S$500,000 as well, and the remaining amount came from Azure Prime Fund on behalf of MG Capital.

Private investor Koh Chuan Koon invested S$200,000. He is the founder and chief technology officer of TripZilla, an online travel media and technology company in South-east Asia.

Of the S$9 million in funds raised, about S$3 million came from private investor Hin Chin Qui, a director at Singapore-based property and hospitality group Chong Sing. He will hold about 18.1 per cent of Jasper’s enlarged share capital upon the issue and allotment of the placement and warrant shares.

Maritime veteran Wong Shun Lee also made a S$2.5 million investment into Jasper, representing about 15.1 per cent of the enlarged stake.

Wong Shun Lee is the managing director of Poly Million Group and has extensive experience across the oil and gas industry.

His involvement in the maritime industry will benefit Jasper “as the group seeks to expand its commercial activities in the maritime sector”, the company said.

It added that its CEO Dennis Goh identified the investors through his personal and business networks, developed during his earlier work in the venture capital space, including as co-founder and executive chairman of Lyte Ventures.

In a separate filing on Thursday, Jasper announced that Goh had been redesignated as its executive director and CEO.

The placement issue price of S$0.0015 per share represents a 50 per cent premium to the volume weighted average price of S$0.001 per share on May 30, the full market day preceding the date the placement agreements were signed.

Jasper was placed on SGX’s watch list on Jun 6, 2023, as it had recorded pre-tax losses for three consecutive financial years.

It also had an average daily market capitalisation of less than S$40 million during the six months prior to that date.",shipping technology investment

Ship finance is a broad term that involves corporate financial management of shipping companies and shipyards as well as new-building finance. Shipping companies need funds in order to refinance their debts, to sustain their working capital and to acquire vessels. Shipyards also need to finance their working capital before delivering orders and receiving full payments. There are two main sources of capital allowing shipping companies to finance their businesses; raising money through equity financing (sales of shares) or debt (loans and bonds). In the case of shipbuilding, debt financing includes using leasing schemes. Given the fact that the maritime industry is highly capital intensive, and with the 2008 Global Financial Crisis’ depressing effects on global economy and international trade, its financing has become critical for the shipbuilding sector and shipping companies around the world.",shipping technology investment

New Holland presses the accelerator,https://www.cng-mobility.ch/en/beitrag/new-holland-presses-the-accelerator/,N/A,"At the Agritechnica 2023 trade fair in November, New Holland will present the new T7 with CNG drive for the first time. As the third vehicle after the T6.180 Methane Power and the pre-production prototype of the T7 Methane Power LNG, it expands the tractor portfolio with alternative powertrains for field use and climate-friendlier agriculture from the second half of 2024.

“We are convinced that biogas is the best available solution today for cost reduction and emission avoidance. However, powerful tractors are still needed in agriculture and we are committed to providing such solutions,” says Carlo Lambro, Brand President of New Holland Agriculture. And that is what the agricultural specialist is doing at the world’s leading trade fair for agricultural technology, Agritechnica from 12 to 18 November 2023 in Hanover (D), by soon having three gas-powered tractors in its portfolio.

The New Holland T6.180 Methane Power with CNG drive, for example, which is already being used successfully in Thayngen SH, will be supplemented by the T7 Methane Power LNG, which can be seen as a pre-series prototype. This rolls to the field work with liquefied gas instead of compressed gas. “With the T6.180 Methane Power, New Holland broke technological barriers and achieves power and torque levels that are on par with a diesel tractor,” says Oscar Baroncelli, head of product management for tractors and telehandlers at New Holland Agriculture. “The T7 Methane Power LNG now matches diesel models not only in terms of power, but also range.”

The CNG powertrain under the hood of the T7 delivers 270 hp and has a longer range, thanks primarily to more CNG tanks on board. Source: New Holland

This means: even in operations with high power requirements, the tractor with LNG drive and up to 270 hp manages a complete working day without refuelling and without a range extender. The reason: liquefied biogas has four times the storage capacity of compressed gas. The T7 Methane Power LNG is also equipped with the patented fuel system with active temperature control. This is based on a stainless steel cryotank and a self-supporting vacuum chamber that insulates the fuel so that the thickness of the tank walls can be reduced. When working in the field, the active temperature control of the tank also ensures smooth engine operation.

New Holland’s third gas tractor, the T7.270 Methane Power CNG, will make its world debut in Hanover. It is based on the T7 platform with PLM Intelligence and is equipped with the latest Horizon Ultra cab as well as the proven 6.7-litre NEF CNG drive, which is also found in the T6.180 Methane Power. However, now with significantly increased power, so that the tractor now also meets high performance expectations. The CNG engine achieves a torque of 1160 Nm and an output of 270 hp

Thanks to additional and cleverly housed CNG tanks, the new tractor with CNG drive can be used in the field for much longer, even without a range extender. Source: New Holland

The engineers have also been able to increase the operating time in the field: by making optimum use of the larger chassis, the T7 can now carry larger CNG tanks. This gives it a storage capacity of 1265 litres or 219 kg of biogas, which is a 178 percent improvement over the T6. Therefore, the new, more powerful CNG model can be used with larger attachments and can handle significantly more operating hours until it stops to refuel. The first units of the T7.270 Methane Power CNG have been undergoing testing since summer 2023, with series production scheduled to start in the second half of 2024.

IIHS Study Reveals Driver Attitudes On Speeding ...,https://www.forbes.com/sites/edgarsten/2024/06/12/iihs-study-reveals-driver-attitudes-on-speeding-prevention-tech/,22 часа назад,"A new survey by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows most drivers would be open to ... [+] technology aimed at preventing speeding. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety

Lead feet on the accelerator are leading to an increasing number of traffic deaths, but a majority of drivers say they would be open to technology aimed at preventing or reducing speeding according to a study released Wednesday.

At the same time, at least one major automaker is studying why some drivers speed more than others and how to mitigation their motivation to do so.

More than 60% of drivers surveyed by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety said they would find it acceptable if audible or visual signals were triggered when they exceeded the speed limit.

In addition, more than half said they were fine if the accelerator pedal was more difficult to press, or if it automatically restricted speed. Such technologies are called “intelligent speed assistance” or ISA which use GPS and a speed limit database, at times together with cameras capable of reading posted signs, to identify and adapt to the actual speed limit, according to the IIHS.

More than 80% of the 1,802 drivers surveyed agreed, or strongly agreed they would like a feature showing the current speed limit and more than 70% said they preferred an “obtrusive tone” warning over technology that automatically adjusted their speed when they exceeded the limit.

“These findings are exciting because they suggest American drivers are willing to change how they drive to make our roads safer,” IIHS President David Harkey said, in a statement. “The conventional wisdom has always been that speed-restricting technology would never fly in our car-centric culture.”

The urgency to reduce speeding comes as federal government figures for 2022, the latest year for which they’re available, show 12,151 speeding-related deaths for that year and that speeding was a contributing factor for 29% in all traffic fatalities.

As heartening as the IIHS survey may appear, troubling attitudes among drivers stand in the way of reducing speeding.

Survey participants were divided into three groups to gauge attitudes regarding different levels of ISA:

· Advisory-only: ISA offering only advisory tones or messages

· Accelerator-feedback: Accelerator is harder to press

· Acceleration-limit: Acceleration is limited if the speed limit is exceeded

While 60% in the advisory-only group said they would be fine if ISA came on automatically when they started each trip, about half of the drivers in the accelerator-feedback and speed-limiter groups said they would frequently override the feature.

“We can no longer pretend this is an unsolvable problem,” said survey designer IIHS Senior Research Scientist Ian Reagan, in a statement. “With the technologies we have now, we could stop virtually all speeding and eliminate speeding tickets to boot. Instead, we seem to be going the opposite direction, with adaptive cruise control and partial automation systems that allow drivers to peg their speed at 90 mph if they want.”

Why drivers choose to speed and how to slow them down is the subject of recent research at Toyota Motor Co.’s Collaborative Safety Research Center in Ann Arbor, Michigan.

“If we can understand the motivations, we may be able to implement countermeasures that are related to those motivations more accepted by the people and results in them exhibiting more safe driving,” said principal scientist Josh Domeyer, during a media briefing at the CSRC last week.

The study, conducted in conjunction with Touchstone Evaluations Inc., and using data from the University of Michigan’s Transportation Research Institute, found the motivation for mashing the gas pedal was not simply a need for speed.

TIndhe amount of time a driver is idling, perhaps stuck in rush hour traffic, how fast other vehicle are traveling and time of day are key contributors to whether or not a driver decides to speed, the study showed.

While the IIHS survey indicates ISA may help mitigate speeding, Toyota research suggests more subtle warnings that are triggered if the technology can predict a driver is about to exceed the speed limit, may be more effective than automatic speed regulation.

“Maybe a visual alert, or maybe a police officer in the rearview mirror,” said Linda Angell of Touchstone Evaluations, during the media briefing. “But if we know a little bit ahead of time a driver is going to speed and if we know what type of driver it is and under what situation you're driving we can intervene perhaps in new ways.”

One of the new ways is Angell presented was a recording of a voice advising the driver not to worry about being late, saying “You can travel the posted speed limit and will be right on time. There’s no need to hurry.”

“So the idea is to nudge the driver towards making a choice,” said Angell.

Indeed, the technology to do so exists, but as IIHS’s Ian Reagan asserts, it needs to be both available and used.

“This technology enables nuanced interventions that were never possible in the past,” Harkey said. “The next challenge is to encourage automakers and drivers to embrace it so we can begin saving lives.”",transportation startup accelerator

unerry,https://startup.google.com/alumni/stories/unerry/,N/A,"Using location data to uncover consumer insights

It all started with vending machines. Japanese vending machines sell everything from bananas to wine to clothes to medical tests, and there are about 5 million vending machines around the country. However, the vending machine market share is decreasing by 5% each year, so retailers had to get creative to keep customers interested in using them. In 2015, Coca-Cola Japan launched a campaign with unerry to build a mobile app that could connect with vending machines and give users points for buying from the machines, using location data and Bluetooth beacons. The campaign was so successful that Coca-Cola invested in unerry and extended the campaign to other markets.

Now, unerry is a major location data company in Japan, with data from over 110 million mobile application IDs around Japan. unerry has used Google Cloud Platform from day one to store, analyze, and protect location information, which they call “people flow data.” The company uses BigQuery to analyze 30 billion data points monthly. “We founded the company in 2015, and Google Cloud helped us start unerry,” says Unerry CEO Hidetoshi Uchiyama. “BigQuery was the only data solution we could use.”

The company, which holds a technology patent for their platform, called Beacon Bank, is also using Google Cloud Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence tools, like Auto ML and Vertex AI, to improve city traffic flow and solve civil engineering problems. unerry recently went public, a few months after graduating from Google for Startups Accelerator: Japan.

Leveraging Google technologies and mentorship

unerry collects location data from mobile devices in two ways: outside, via satellite coverage (GPS) outside, and inside buildings, like retails stores or train stations, from beacons. There are 2.1 million beacons registered on unerry’s Beacon Bank network. unerry collects 30 billion location-based logs every month to uncover consumer insights.

unerry uses Auto ML and Vertex AI to identify users through their visits to retail establishments and predict where they might go next. For example, a user shopping at a market might next visit the restaurant next door. Unerry also aims to improve city traffic flow and solve civil engineering problems by contributing information to smart city development projects.

unerry’s users double every year, so unerry’s team uses Google Cloud to store, analyze, and protect people flow data. BigQuery is the only tool that can allow them to securely analyze such a massive number of data points at an affordable cost. unerry became a Google Cloud Build partner in 2021 and participated in Google for Startups Accelerator: Japan in 2022.

Since participating in the Accelerator, unerry’s team has received biweekly technical mentoring from the Google Cloud team, and Uchiyama says the company’s relationship with Google, including their Accelerator participation and partnership with Google Cloud, helped validate the company as they prepared for their initial public offering (IPO). Three months after graduating from the Accelerator, they went public in July 2022.

unerry maintains a robust privacy policy, in line with Japan’s strict data collection rules. “Our privacy policy helped us gain trust from users, and today, we are the most secure location data company,” says Uchiyama.

What’s next for Unerry

unerry is currently partnering with Mitsubishi Corporation and a developer in Indonesia to provide “people movement data” for an ongoing “smart city” development in Indonesia. “When it comes to developing a smart city, you have to understand how people move within the city before you start planning where to put infrastructure, like a train station or bus stop,” says Chief Strategy Officer Ryan Imaizumi, adding that unerry can also provide value to the people who live and work in the smart city, like details about which areas are crowded and which are not. “We can help navigate people through less crowded areas or reduce congestion by offering a promotion to go to another area, thereby improving the value of the city itself.”

Now that unerry is a large, publicly traded location data company, they hope to expand by collecting customer purchase data from retailers, in addition to the location data they already collect. Combining location data and purchase data would allow them to analyze “real behavior data” for almost all of Japan.

Their advice to other entrepreneurs? “Try to solve the problem and never give up,” says Uchiyama. “Always try to find a solution.”",transportation startup accelerator

KG Mobility refutes results of re-enactment test

KG Mobility, formerly known as SsangYong Motor Co., on Monday refuted the results of a recent re-enactment test conducted to determine the cause of a suspected unintended acceleration accident involving a company-produced vehicle that led to the death of a teenager.The accident occurred in December 2022 in Gangneung, Gangwon, when a KG Mobility SUV driven by a grandmother spun out of control, purportedly due to the sudden unintended acceleration of the car. It resulted in the death of her grandson, who was also in the vehicle.The family of the deceased teenager filed a damages suit against KG Mobility, seeking approximately 760 million won ($552,000) in compensation.In a re-enactment test of the accident conducted by a court-appointed expert in April, results supported the claim that the grandmother did not press the accelerator pedal during the accident. The plaintiffs argued that the acceleration was caused by a vehicle defect.In response, KG Mobility refuted the objectivity of the re-enactment test.It claimed the re-enactment test was carried out under conditions presented by the plaintiffs and added, ""Various conditions, such as acceleration circumstances, differences between the incident vehicle and the test vehicle and differences in road conditions do not align with the National Forensic Service's analysis results and verified objective data.""KG Mobility also argued the test was conducted under the assumption that the driver fully pressed the accelerator pedal for approximately 35 seconds in all driving sections. It also noted that the accident occurred on an uphill road, but the test was conducted on flat ground.The company also claimed that some data and the method of interpreting the transmission patterns derived during the re-enactment test were not properly communicated to the expert.It also argued that the family's independent examination conducted last month regarding the vehicle's automatic emergency braking (AEB) system was not warranted by the court, and that such a test not conducted under the court's supervision cannot be considered objective evidence.Yonhap",transportation startup accelerator

To accelerate the transition to climate neutral flight by developing evidence-based, multidisciplinary tools that allow decision makers to understand, build and embark on the pathways to sustainable flight.

About the AIA

The aviation sector offers society significant value – facilitating the flow of goods and services and allowing ideas and people to connect. However, the sector also makes a significant and growing contribution to climate change, and thus far has yet to show it is capable of responding to the global shift towards a net zero future.

To achieve that shift will require joined-up thinking by decision makers – making the right policy and investment decisions. The scale of change required and the urgency of climate change means transformative change that requires simultaneously understanding aircraft design and operation; energy production; fuel production and supply chains; land use; and airport infrastructure. All of these factors need to be considered holistically, alongside economics and safety constraints involved.

The AIA’s goal is to provide accessible tools for innovation, policy and implementation, that draw on a world-leading network of multisectoral and multidisciplinary expertise. The project benefits from its collaboration between deep academic insight and engaged industry stakeholders, allowing science and engineering-based computer models and simulations to be created that can evaluate solutions objectively, while also highlighting the uncertainties and risks involved, showing possibilities and probabilities for any chosen policy direction.

About the Aviation Impact Accelerator

The AIA is an international group of practitioners and academics convened by the University of Cambridge. Benefitting from its ability to draw from a multi-disciplinary range of expertise, it develops interactive, evidence-based models, simulations, and visualisations. This provides tools for decision-makers and the wider engaged public to understand the pathways to net zero flight. The project provides an authoritative evaluation of possible future technology choices, emphasising the impact, opportunities and risks for aviation industry stakeholders and senior decision-makers.

The project was born out of a series of discussions hosted by HRH The Prince of Wales in early 2020. These included roundtables at Clarence House and the Whittle Laboratory, convened by CISL and the Sustainable Markets Initiative. These initial meetings were attended by high-level aviation business leaders, academics and policy makers.

Currently, the AIA has a core team of over 60 contributors and has gained from the inputs of over 80 different companies in the aviation sector. It has developed a broad range of academic and industry partners, and has structured itself into a range of small, cross-disciplinary teams looking at multiple aspects of the system including aircraft and propulsion technology; fuels; airports; network modelling; non-CO2 emissions; model design and the broader economic and policy context. The AIA team have built a holistic model which was previewed at COP26 in Glasgow in November 2020.

Who’s involved?

The Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL) leads this project alongside the University of Cambridge’s Whittle Laboratory.

CISL’s role in coordinating the project ranges between the areas of industry engagement, communications and media, policy and business research, and project management. In its stakeholder management capacities, CISL works to engage new partners and foster wider collaborations and engagement within industry representatives with the project. Coordinating the various parties interested in the project, CISL works to promote the AIA’s wider work through convening media and communications opportunities. Using institutional policy expertise, CISL works to research how the AIA can have an impact on UK and global aviation policy. CISL’s wider work is focused on developing leadership and solutions and facilitating collaboration and dialogue for a sustainable economy within its business and policy leaders’ groups.

The Whittle Laboratory leads the technical research and whole system modelling, alongside leading on industrial collaborations to make the AIA a truly academic-industrial endeavour which provides research excellence with real world relevance and impact.

CISL works with other academic institutions to drive forward the initiative including, the University of Cambridge’s Department of Chemical Engineering and Biotechnology, Hopkinson Laboratory, BP Institute, Bennett Institute for Public Policy, and Judge Business School, together with the Air Transportation Systems Lab at University College London, University of Technology Sydney, and the Melbourne Energy Institute at the University of Melbourne.

The initiative is in collaboration with HRH The Prince of Wales’s Sustainable Markets Initiative, The World Economic Forum, Cambridge Zero, MathWorks, and SATAVIA, with the technical input of industry advisors including Rolls-Royce, Boeing, BP, Heathrow and Siemens Energy.

Clare Shine (CEO, CISL) said: “International travel helps people and societies connect. To retain this opportunity for future generations, we must urgently address aviation’s environmental impact as part of systemic decarbonisation of the economy. This calls for imaginative and inclusive innovation, which is why the Aviation Impact Accelerator brings together insight from industry, policy, and civil society. CISL has played a central role in developing this project and we are passionate about centring people, nature and climate in all are work focused on systemic change.”

EcoBeam GmbH is a company that provides a mobile software solution called Buddyp2p, which is focused on offering sharing economy services. Starting with Â parking sharing, where homeowners and businesses can offer their unused parking space in exchange for money, allowing people coming from outside the city, to have more access to affordable city parking. By improving resource allocation, P2P can lead to a cleaner environment and more efficient use of resources. An increase in occupancy per unit results in a greener future.

Management Team:

Leon Nagel is the CEO & Co-founder of EcoBeam GmbH - Currently, Studying Bachelor in Business management and comes from a family business background, and he is from Hamburg, Germany.Weiji Zhang is the COO & Co-founder of EcoBeam GmbH- Currently, Studying Bachelor in Business management and comes from a hospitality business background and he is from SiChuan, China.

â

Problem and Opportunity:

There are numerous parking houses/spaces in city centers that people require, but they are extremely expensive for them, and they are left with no choice but to pay for them as there are no other options unless they park very far away. Moreover, those who sometimes spend 15 minutes trying to look for a cheaper alternative, can't find one, because there is none.

On the other hand, there are many parking spaces from homeowners and businesses in the city center that aren't utilized throughout the week, implying that if they could be made available to the individuals in need, it would help to solve the problem.

â

What makes our startup unique?

Buddyp2p is the sharing economy in one APP. This means that we will make it possible for users to be able to access all their sharing economy services in one environment and that with a really easy usability.

Secondly, we are putting trust, security and functionality first, we are monitoring the license plates and identifying users ID's as well as other security features to make sure payments are guaranteed, and the service works in practice.

Thirdly, with our software, it is possible for homeowners to be 100% flexible with their listing of the parking spaces. If you just want to list your parking in 5 minutes for 1h on a Thursday evening, then do it! 100% flexibility for Homeowners.

IIHS: Most drivers would be OK with anti-speeding tech in ...,https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/iihs-most-drivers-would-be-ok-with-anti-speeding-tech-in-vehicles-survey-shows/,1 день назад,"More than 60% of drivers would find it acceptable if their vehicle provided an audible and visual warning when they exceeded the posted speed limit, a new survey from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows

More than 60% of drivers would find it acceptable if their vehicle provided an audible and visual warning when they exceeded the posted speed limit, a new survey from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety shows.

Perhaps more surprisingly, about half of drivers say they wouldn’t mind vehicle technology that makes the accelerator pedal harder to press or automatically restricts speed.

“These findings are exciting because they suggest American drivers are willing to change how they drive to make our roads safer,” IIHS President David Harkey said. “The conventional wisdom has always been that speed-restricting technology would never fly in our car-centric culture.”

Speeding kills. It’s consistently a factor in more than a quarter of U.S. traffic fatalities. In 2022, the latest year for which numbers are available, that amounted to more than 12,000 deaths. Yet about half of drivers admit to driving at least 15 mph over the limit in the past month, according to the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.

“We can no longer pretend this is an unsolvable problem,” said IIHS Senior Research Scientist Ian Reagan, who designed the survey about intelligent speed assistance (ISA). “With the technologies we have now, we could stop virtually all speeding and eliminate speeding tickets to boot. Instead, we seem to be going the opposite direction, with adaptive cruise control and partial automation systems that allow drivers to peg their speed at 90 mph if they want.”

Speed limiters have been around for years, but the conventional type only allows one maximum setting. That means that the few fleet operators and others who use them have to set the maximum at highway speeds, making them useless on the vast majority of U.S. roads.

In contrast, ISA systems use GPS and a speed limit database, sometimes together with cameras capable of reading posted signs, to identify and adapt to the actual speed limit. The little icon with the local speed limit that pops up in the corner of the Apple Maps, Google Maps and Waze apps is a simple version. (Waze and some other less well-known apps also offer additional ISA functions.)

More robust ISA systems sound a warning or flash an alert when the driver exceeds the limit — or when they exceed it by more than a specific amount. Others provide accelerator feedback — making the pedal harder to push — or restrict power to the engine to prevent the driver from going too fast.

As of next month, the European Union will require all new vehicles to be equipped with ISA systems that at least give audible or visual warnings, though drivers will be able to turn the systems off.

To gain more insight into how American drivers would feel about ISA, Reagan conducted a survey of 1,802 drivers.

To account for how respondents’ driving style might influence their feelings about ISA, Reagan asked general questions about the danger of speeding, the effectiveness of technology and the respondents’ own driving behavior. Drivers of all types were randomly assigned to three groups. One group was asked about ISA that provides an advisory warning, another about ISA that makes the accelerator harder to press, and a third about ISA that restricts acceleration when the vehicle exceeds the speed limit.

The survey measured whether respondents would find the technology acceptable. In the research context, “acceptability” has a specific meaning. It’s meant to reflect whether a person would want to have or choose to use a feature or product that they have never experienced before, and it’s calculated based on the answers to various queries, rather than a single yes or no question. Any version of ISA likely to be adopted in the U.S. would give drivers the option to switch it off, so it will only be beneficial to the extent that the public finds it acceptable.

In that respect, the survey results were encouraging.

Regardless of group, more than 80% of all drivers agreed or strongly agreed that they would want a feature that displayed the current speed limit. More than 70% of all drivers also agreed or strongly agreed that they would want an unobtrusive tone to sound when the speed limit changes.

There was a clear preference for advisory systems over those that intervene to control the vehicle’s speed, however.

Nearly 60% of drivers in the advisory-only group agreed it would be acceptable if the ISA system came on automatically at the beginning of every trip, compared with 51% of drivers in the accelerator-feedback group and 48% of drivers in the speed-limiter group.

Likewise, 65% of drivers in the advisory group said they would want their next car to have ISA if most other vehicles had it, compared with 51% and 52% for the other two groups. Similar proportions said it would be a good idea for ISA to be required in all new cars.

Around 70% of drivers in all groups agreed they would want ISA in their next car if their insurance company lowered their premiums based on evidence that they don’t speed.

The percentages who agreed that ISA would be acceptable to them also increased across all groups if the feature intervened at 10 mph over the posted limit, compared with 1-2 mph over. Nearly 80% of the advisory-only group and more than half of the other two groups said the feature would be acceptable if it had a 10 mph tolerance.

The standard set by the EU is not that liberal. The EU requires warnings to start when the vehicle speed matches the speed limit for six seconds and after 1.5 seconds when the vehicle exceeds the posted limit by any amount. The survey suggests that if the U.S. adopted the same standard, more drivers would switch off the feature.

The survey flagged other potential pitfalls.

Frequent speeders were 20% less likely to accept ISA than occasional or rare speeders, suggesting those who need it most might use it the least. However, the two groups were about equally likely to say they would keep the feature switched on if their vehicle had it. Perhaps that means frequent speeders recognize that the system would be useful to them, though they have mixed feelings about it.

Overall, about half of the drivers in the accelerator-feedback and speed-limiter groups said they would frequently override the feature.

A federal mandate could help overcome resistance, the survey shows.

Past research has shown that drivers worry about irritating other motorists if they drive slowly, and the surveyed drivers were more likely to say they would accept ISA if most other vehicles had it.

U.S. regulators could also make the feature more attractive — and more likely to be used — with design elements that are missing from the EU’s requirements. U.S. drivers might be more apt to accept a system that allowed a higher tolerance on interstates and freeways but had a lower threshold in school zones and other areas with many pedestrians and bicyclists.

“This technology enables nuanced interventions that were never possible in the past,” Harkey said. “The next challenge is to encourage automakers and drivers to embrace it so we can begin saving lives.”

The message is loud and clear with these announcements that Singapore will actively electrify its transportation sector. There are still many areas like infrastructure roll out, billing systems, interoperability of apps etc that are required to smooth out the experience for the electric car drivers.

Do electric cars crash more frequently than conventionally ...,https://etsc.eu/do-electric-cars-crash-more-frequently-than-conventionally-powered-cars/,N/A,"The Swiss branch of AXA, an insurer, says its data show electric vehicles crash 50% more often than conventionally-powered cars.

The company says the reason for this is likely to be the higher acceleration of, in particular, the more powerful electric cars. The underlying data have not been published. AXA’s German branch said, in a separate news release, that its data from the German market did not lead to the same conclusion.

The recently-launched Mercedes EQS (pictured) has a stated acceleration of 0-100 km/h of 6.2 seconds in the standard version, and 3.8 seconds for the 658 horsepower AMG variant. The UK Tesla website describes its Model S Plaid edition as having “the quickest acceleration of any vehicle in production” and list acceleration of 0-100 km/h in 2.1 seconds on their German website for that model. The Model 3, the company’s cheapest, can achieve acceleration of 0-100 km/h in 3.3 seconds.

AXA is encouraging drivers of high-powered electric vehicles to manually reduce the level of acceleration on their vehicles.

The company also looked at the question of the additional weight of electric vehicles and says this can create additional risks in crashes involving older conventional vehicles. AXA says modern conventionally-powered vehicles should not fare worse in a crash with an electric vehicle.

The company also said that electric cars are not riskier when it comes to extraction after a crash. It says high voltage electric systems are switched off instantaneously in the event of a collision, and the risk of a fire occurring is no higher than with a conventional vehicle.",transportation startup accelerator

KG Mobility refutes credibility of fatal accident reenactment,https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240610005500320,3 дня назад,"SEOUL, June 10 (Yonhap) -- KG Mobility, former known as SsangYong Motor Co., on Monday refuted the results of a recent reenactment test conducted to determine the cause of a suspected unintended acceleration accident involving a company-produced vehicle that led to the death of a teenager.

The accident occurred in December 2022 in Gangneung, Gangwon Province, when a KG Mobility SUV driven by a grandmother spun out of control, purportedly due to the sudden unintended acceleration of the car. It resulted in the death of her grandson, who was also in the vehicle.

The family of the deceased teenager has filed a damages suit against KG Mobility, seeking approximately 760 million won (US$552,000) in compensation.

In a reenactment test of the accident conducted by a court-appointed expert in April, results supported the claim that the grandmother did not press the accelerator pedal during the accident. The plaintiffs argued that the acceleration was caused by a vehicle defect.

In response, KG Mobility refuted the objectivity of the reenactment test.



This photo provided by KG Mobility shows the company's plant in Pyeongtaek, south of Seoul. (PHOTO NOT FOR SALE) (Yonhap)

It claimed the reenactment test was carried out under conditions presented by the plaintiffs and added, ""Various conditions, such as acceleration circumstances, differences between the incident vehicle and the test vehicle, and differences in road conditions, do not align with the National Forensic Service's analysis results and verified objective data.""

KG Mobility also argued the test was conducted under the assumption that the driver pressed the accelerator pedal 100 percent for approximately 35 seconds in all driving sections. It also noted that the accident occurred on an uphill road, but the test was conducted on flat ground.

The company also claimed some data and the method of interpreting the transmission patterns derived during the reenactment test were not properly communicated to the expert.

It also argued that the family's independent examination conducted last month regarding the vehicle's automatic emergency braking (AEB) system was not warranted by the court and that such a test not conducted under the court's supervision cannot be considered objective evidence.

Top 15 Spanish Investors to Watch in 2024,https://150sec.com/top-15-spanish-investors-to-watch-in-2024/19576/,21 час назад,"The Spanish entrepreneurial ecosystem has shown resilience in recent years, despite global economic challenges. According to Bankinter’s report, startups raised €2.33 billion in 382 deals in 2023.

Zbee e-3W production to start in India in August,https://www.electrive.com/2024/06/12/zbee-e3w-made-india-fall-2024/,1 день назад,"Clean Motion is taking the initiative to manufacture the Zbee in India through its local subsidiary Clean Mobility Solutions India Pvt Ltd. Venture capital fund India Accelerator has invested in the company’s local arm to help it localise the EV. The agreement between the two companies includes an initial investment of SEK 6.8 million (604,425 euros) and a licensing agreement to manufacture and sell in the country.

Production of the Zbee in India will take place in Pune, a city roughly 150 km away from India’s financial capital Mumbai. Clean Motion says it will start manufacturing the electric three-wheeler at its upcoming Indian plant this fall. The company expects to ramp up output quickly and has set a goal of increasing the monthly production to 1,000 vehicles within three years.

The Zbee measures just 2.4 metres in length, 1.25 metres in width, and 1.5 metres in height, which makes it easy to drive on tight and busy Indian roads. It is made of fibre-reinforced plastic, so it weighs just 280 kg. It can accommodate three people, including the driver, and it has a 3-point safety belt on all seats.

The Zbee uses brushless hub motors in both rear wheels and a lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery pack. Charging the battery pack takes approximately four and a half hours (AC)/one hour (DC). The electric moped has a top speed of 45 kph and can be driven up to 80 km on a full charge.

Clean Motion launched the Zbee in India in February 2016, starting with units locally assembled units in Faridabad, a city about 50 km away from the national capital Delhi. Currently, the company offers the commuter version of the Zbee on a wet lease. It provides first and last-mile transport services for commuting between metro stations, office hubs, colleges, commercial landmarks, hospitals, etc. In the future, it will introduce a cargo version of the Zbee to enter the quick commerce service sector, although it hasn’t stated a specific timeline for the new venture.

Technology Record - Issue 23: Winter 21/22

116 www. t e c h n o l o g y r e c o r d . c om F E ATUR E Leslie Paulson General Manager for Servigistics Business Unit at PTC âHow may I serve you today? A simple question and a gesture familiar to a legion of customer-facing employees. Customers want what they want when they want it, and it can be challenging for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to exceed these expectations efficiently. Why is that? How can OEMs deliver high availability with minimal costs? The answer is a combination of digital thread and service innovation which deliver agile, competitive supply chains. There is a ubiquitous market need for asset uptime and readiness. Regardless of the industry, unplanned downtime is unacceptable. Fortunately, a tsunami of technology innovation is a tailwind for OEMs. Access to equipment utilisation data, sophisticated optimisation algorithms and secure cloud technology maximises asset uptime and readiness. Leaning heavily on digital thread and service innovation is a proven pathway to success creating better products, faster, and optimising service delivery. Maximum equipment uptime delights customers, and delighted customers are the most loyal.â Greg Crandall ERP Practice Director at JourneyTEAM âMicrosoft cloud technologies have allowed tighter integration with the sales and production facilities by having complete connection between customer relationship management and enterprise resource planning (Dynamics 365). We are able to help our manufacturing clients improve efficiency in quoting, gain insight into inventory, and streamline order management and scheduling production. This has been especially helpful for customers who have widespread sales channels internationally with main production facilities in one or two locations. In addition, cloud technologies have allowed our small and medium business clients to take advantage of the ability to integrate with independent commerce channels, use D365 ERP to manage orders and demand and then spin up thirdparty logistics (3PL) vendors who handle all fulfilment tasks and easily send orders electronically to the 3PL for final shipment. Companies can quickly get to market in months as opposed to years to build all that infrastructure themselves. Cloud helps them to leverage into a fast-running, profitable business model.â âHaving battled shortages and disruptions during the pandemic, manufacturers need tools that provide more insight into their internal and external supply chains and improve predictability. Manufacturers embracing direct-to-customer business models must adapt to rapidly changing demand, and the advent of mass customisation requires flexible manufacturing operations and supply chains. Meanwhile manufacturers are under constant pressure to increase production efficiency and time to market. Production, and the health and performance of the machines that power it, has historically been a blind spot in manufacturing supply chains even though machine failures can have major upstream and downstream impact. Malfunctioning machines are hidden supply chain risks. To achieve more predictable production, Augury customers can combine mechanical machine data from Auguryâs Machine Health solution with recipe data from the manufacturer âs Azure DL instance in order to determine which facilities or production lines are best suited to produce a particular recipe at high quality and with minimal waste.â Chris Dobbrow Vice President of Strategic Partnerships at Augury

Logistics service innovation by third party ...,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/transe/v118y2018icp291-307.html,Автор: Z Chu,"In response to intensifying competition and escalating customer expectations, third-party logistics (3PL) providers need to become more innovative. In logistics service innovation, external relationships are important sources of resources and knowledge. Drawing on social capital theory and the strategy-structure-performance paradigm, this study proposes that guanxi (Chinese system of social networks and relationships that facilitates business and other dealings), expedites logistics service innovation by 3PL providers in China. This study also proposes that the effect of guanxi on logistics service innovation is contingent on the alignment between the type of guanxi and the provider’s organizational structure. We tested our proposed model using survey data from 165 3PL providers in China. Our findings suggest that both political and business guanxi have a positive effect on logistics service innovation; however, those types of guanxi should be used in consideration of the firm’s organizational structure. The results suggest that with respect to logistics service innovation, political guanxi is more effective for 3PL providers whose organizational structure is highly centralized or has low formalization. The converse applies to business guanxi.

Billing innovation helps SnapFulfil win 3PL business,https://www.logisticsmatters.co.uk/Billing-innovation-WMS-3PL-business,N/A,"16 June 2020

WMS firm SnapFulfil says its software helps 3PL clients bill their customers with greater precision.

With margins ever tightening, there’s the option of setting different rates for quantities shipped and charging accordingly, offering greater economies of scale. The new software also helps with better data quality, resources allocation and process flow – critical at the best of times, but certainly during the present Covid-19 pandemic.

Value added services can be recorded on RF (either adhoc or against shipments and receipts) and charged onto the customer. Improved flexibility also means more focus on storage and tenure charges - with 3PLs now able to bill for occupancy of an entire section, bay or zone, as well as by SKU per location and by product volume (cm3) for storage in STU and non STU controlled slots.

Additionally, with charges increasingly itemised, the enhancements provide extra ways and means to bill by manifest and for dispatch note, bill of lading and goods received note document generation.

Other functionality enhancements include pick surcharges and the ability to bill for oversized products using the STT type; passing on shipping carrier and consumables charges; specific shipment cost and invoice breakdown; generating recurring support charges, as well as invoices for a priority shipment or receipt where additional labour has been used to rush through the processing.

SnapFulfil’s managing director UK & Europe, Tony Dobson, said: “We’ve worked closely with a number of 3PL customers to develop these advancements because all businesses are different, and we understand the need for arriving at workable solutions together. The feedback has been excellent, with clients also benefitting from tiered rates of charging for the likes of split and smaller pallets.”

Wigan based business 3PL – which specialises in multichannel fulfilment for fast growing brands in the e-commerce, retail, and wholesale sectors, via 250,000 sq.ft of high-quality warehouse accommodation – is a recent SnapFulfil WMS client taking advantage of all the new software

3PL managing director, Ian Walker, added: ""We chose SnapFulfil because it’s scalable, stable, configurable, affordable and API friendly, plus it has a range of functionality specifically tailored to the needs of 3PLs. It has allowed us to really sharpen up our warehouse management efficiencies, providing greater accuracy and transparency, as well as cost and resource savings.""",3PL tech innovation

Combine that with surges in business volume. Add a spike in the level of returns or seasonal peaks, and it can be challenging for even the most experienced logistics operation to meet KPIs.

And with the exponential growth in ecommerce across the world, innovative capabilities for fulfillment, last mile delivery and return logistics have become critical. That’s why retailers are looking to partner with 3PLs and leverage their innovations to tackle demand-driven fulfillment challenges.

Third-Party Logistics Trends Taking E-Commerce by Storm ...,https://www.envoynetworks.ca/blogs/third-party-logistics-trends-taking-e-commerce-by-storm-in-2024,N/A,"As an e-commerce business owner, keeping up with trends in third party logistics services is crucial to staying competitive. In 2024, several key 3PL trends will significantly impact how you store, ship, and deliver products to meet customer expectations. Partnering with a 3PL provider at the cutting edge of these trends can help future-proof your supply chain and ensure a seamless customer experience.

Automation and Artificial Intelligence Streamline 3PL Operations

Automation and AI are enabling 3PLs to optimize operations like never before. Many 3PLs are leveraging automation to reduce costs, improve accuracy, and increase throughput in their warehouses and transportation systems.

Robotics and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are handling repetitive, physically demanding tasks like loading, unloading, and moving pallets. AGVs follow programmed routes to transport materials without human guidance, reducing labor costs and the risk of workplace injuries. Some 3PLs are experimenting with autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) that can navigate dynamically changing environments.

Many 3PLs are using AI for route optimization and predictive analytics. AI can analyze huge amounts of data to optimize last mile delivery routes, reducing fuel costs and transit times. AI also enables predictive maintenance by identifying patterns that indicate when equipment needs service. This reduces downtime and ensures maximum operational efficiency.

Automated sortation systems, guided by AI, are able to rapidly scan, sort, and route packages to the correct loading bay or truck. These systems minimize the chance of misdirected shipments and speed up the handling process.

E-commerce companies will benefit from working with tech-savvy 3PLs on the cutting edge of automation and AI. Those able to leverage these technologies will gain significant competitive advantages through reduced costs, improved accuracy and speed, and an enhanced customer experience. The future of logistics will be highly automated, and 3PLs must continue innovating to meet the rapidly changing demands of e-commerce.

The Rise of on-Demand, Instant Delivery

As an e-commerce business owner, staying on top of logistics trends is key to staying competitive. One trend that will significantly impact order fulfillment in 2024 is the rise of on-demand, instant delivery.

With major retailers like Amazon and Walmart raising the bar for fast, free shipping, customers now expect near instant gratification. To meet these demands, third-party logistics providers ( 3PLs ) and carriers are accelerating delivery speeds and optimizing routes.

Same-day and next-day delivery options are becoming standard, and in some areas, delivery within 2 hours of ordering is possible. Companies will need to evaluate if offering expedited shipping and tight delivery windows is feasible and determine how to balance customer satisfaction with profitability. This may require renegotiating carrier contracts, adjusting order cut-off times, and strategically locating distribution centers.

Crowdsourced delivery, where independent contractors handle the last mile of delivery, is enabling faster shipping at a lower cost. However, this model can be difficult to scale and quality may vary. Robots and autonomous vehicles also show promise for shortening delivery times, especially for small parcels in densely populated areas.

Omnichannel fulfillment, a seamless customer experience across channels, will be crucial. Customers expect to order online, in-store or on their mobile devices and receive their items when and how they want. An omnichannel strategy supported by a robust 3PL can satisfy customers and provide a competitive advantage.

To keep up with the pace of change in e-commerce and exceed customer delivery expectations, partnering with an experienced 3PL is advisable. They can help you determine how to implement these trends in a strategic, cost-effective way using their supply chain expertise and advanced technology solutions. Fast, accurate delivery at a fair price - that is the future of e-commerce in 2024 and beyond.

Increased Use of Robotics and Warehousing Technology

Increased use of robotics and warehousing technology will transform third-party logistics in 2024. As an e-commerce business owner, investigating how 3PL companies are implementing these innovations can help you choose a provider poised for efficiency and growth.

Automated Picking and Sorting

Many 3PLs now use automated picking machines, conveyor belts, and robotic arms to quickly locate, retrieve, and sort inventory in their warehouses. These technologies can assemble and pack customer orders with a high degree of accuracy at impressive speeds. Some systems can process up to 1,000 orders per hour. Employing automated picking and sorting reduces costs for 3PLs and allows them to take on more volume without expanding their physical space.

AI-Based Inventory Management

Artificial intelligence optimizes how 3PLs track and allocate inventory. AI-driven software monitors trends in a business’s order data to predict which products are most likely to sell. The 3PL can then position those items in the most accessible areas of the warehouse to speed up order fulfillment. AI also helps 3PLs reorder stock at the optimal time to avoid shortages or surpluses. E-commerce companies benefit from these AI-based inventory management solutions through fewer stockouts, quicker delivery times, and lower overhead costs.

Enhanced Shipping Solutions

Many 3PLs now provide e-commerce clients access to automated shipping stations where workers or robotic arms assemble and label packages for delivery. Some also integrate shipping software that chooses the most economical and expedient carrier based on the destination and type of items in an order. These enhanced shipping solutions get e-commerce orders out the door and on the way to customers as efficiently as possible.

The increasing use of these technologies allows 3PLs to improve productivity, reduce errors, and strengthen their value proposition to e-commerce companies. Choosing a 3PL already investing in robotics and warehousing innovation can help position an e-commerce business for sustainable growth in 2024 and beyond.

Focus on Sustainability and Green Supply Chains

In 2024, focusing on sustainability and green supply chains will be crucial for e-commerce companies. Reducing environmental impact through eco-friendly practices and a lower carbon footprint is becoming increasingly important to consumers.

Implementing sustainable shipping and packaging options are two key ways for e-commerce businesses to go green. Using recycled and recyclable materials that minimize waste, as well as optimizing delivery routes to reduce emissions are impactful steps towards environmentally-friendly operations. For example, choosing biodegradable packing materials, reusable shipping envelopes and consolidating customer orders and shipments can decrease the amount of packaging needed and lower the number of delivery trips required.

Forming partnerships with third-party logistics (3PL) providers targeting sustainability is another way for e-commerce companies to strengthen their green supply chain. 3PLs focusing on environmental initiatives will have the necessary experience and resources to help e-commerce businesses develop and execute eco-friendly strategies. They can assist with waste reduction programs, monitor and report on key performance indicators related to sustainability, and stay up-to-date with the latest green technologies and solutions for supply chain optimization.

E-commerce businesses should also consider obtaining environmental certifications to clearly demonstrate their commitment to sustainability. Certifications like LEED and ISO 14001 require meeting high standards for environmental management systems and green building design. Becoming certified can help build trust and loyalty with eco-conscious customers seeking brands that share their values.

Focusing on sustainability and greening your supply chain is not only good for the environment, but also good for business. With consumers increasingly making purchase decisions based on corporate social responsibility, e-commerce companies will need to make sustainability a priority to gain a competitive advantage in 2024 and beyond. Implementing initiatives with the help of 3PL partners and becoming certified are impactful ways to strengthen your brand and bottom line.

More Partnerships Between 3PLs and E-Commerce Companies

As e-commerce continues to grow, many companies are turning to third-party logistics (3PL) providers to help manage the increased shipping demands. 3PLs that focus on e-commerce are forging partnerships with online retailers to provide customized solutions.

Tailored Services

E-commerce 3PLs are offering services tailored to the unique needs of e-commerce companies. This includes options like:

Same-day delivery and fulfillment for local customers.

Flexible warehousing solutions that can scale up quickly during peak seasons.

Advanced tracking and notifications so customers know the status of their order at every step.

Returns management to handle the 30% of e-commerce goods that are returned.

Data and Analytics

E-commerce thrives on data, and 3PLs have invested heavily in data analytics and technology. Using the retailer’s data, an e-commerce 3PL can optimize the supply chain to:

Predict order volumes to properly staff warehouses and prepare inventory.

Determine the most efficient way to pick, pack and ship orders.

Identify ways to reduce costs while maintaining a high level of service.

Gain insights into customer preferences and behavior to improve the overall experience.

Partnership Model

The most successful e-commerce 3PLs view the relationship as a true partnership. They take the time to understand the retailer’s brand, business model and challenges. Both parties are invested in the other’s success. These strategic partnerships often last for many years and lead to:

Customized solutions tailored to the retailer’s needs.

Shared knowledge and resources to drive innovation.

Growth opportunities as the e-commerce company scales.

Long-term cost savings through process efficiencies.

Improved customer satisfaction and loyalty.

E-commerce companies should look for a 3PL able to forge a collaborative partnership focused on data, technology and tailored services. This will position the company for growth and success in the fast-paced world of online retail.

3PL challenges and solutions: Navigating the new normal

The rapid growth of e-commerce is driving the demand for 3PL (third-party logistics) services worldwide. Fuelled by the COVID-19 pandemic, the global 3PL market, which was valued at around $1 trillion in 2020, is expected to cross the $1.75 trillion mark by 2026. In the new normal, 3PL has acted as the engine of the global economy, keeping the wheels moving for companies and customers.In such a scenario, the Live Enterprise concept enables 3PL service providers to respond and evolve to new business challenges as well as transform them to circular, demand-driven supply chains. Live Enterprise allows them to have a collaborative, cross-functioning, and seamless network in every interaction through digital tools.

However, growth in 3PL has also increased consumer expectations for on-time and accurate deliveries, thus presenting new challenges. As a result, the logistics strategies of global businesses will require pivoting to best practices and using expertise to meet new challenges thrown by the pandemic.





The 3PL challenges

The pandemic sparked a rise in e-commerce sales. Today, a record of 36.1% of all retail sales are taking place online, indicating a 77.6% increase compared with February 2020. For many businesses, agility has become the key. For many businesses, agility has become the key. Agility demands that all functions and processes of an organisation, as well as the insights generated, are visible through the entire cycle. But logistics operations are complex, which presents several challenges for 3PL and must be overcome to induce this sentient quality in fragmented supply chains



Poor end-to-end visibility: 3PL operations suffered due to a lack of end-to-end visibility, especially in last-mile delivery due to COVID-19 lockdown zones and travel restrictions. These disruptions affected planning, predictability, and customer satisfaction.

"ITS Logistics Expands technology investments, opens SF Bay Area ...",https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/its-logistics-expands-technology-investments-opens-sf-bay-area-innovation-center-1033254006,N/A,"RENO, Nev., April 16, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ITS Logistics, one of the fastest-growing logistics companies in the United States, today announced the opening of its Tech Innovation Center located in Walnut Creek, CA, in the heart of the technology-rich San Francisco bay area. ITS has grown more than 300% in revenue since 2020 and provides a full suite of technology-driven supply chain solutions, including network transportation, drayage and intermodal, container management, omnichannel distribution and fulfillment, and network optimization.



ITS Logistics remains focused on combining technology innovation with world-class business operations and a level of data quality that customers can fully trust.

“Opening our Technology Innovation Center in the Bay Area is an integral part of a nine-figure investment in our modern 3PL business model,” said Scott Pruneau, CEO of ITS Logistics. “This new center is designed to leverage innovative and emerging technologies that will enable our team to unlock real, tangible value for our customers.""

This Silicon Valley hub is core to the company’s continued investment in growth and innovation—including physical locations and assets, proprietary cloud technologies, and industry-leading talent acquisition—and coincides with the release of the company’s first public-facing container management and visibility platform, ContainerAI.

“We operate our entire company in the ITS Cloud, for our operations, our customers, and our carrier partners. We have no data centers, no legacy applications, and virtually no technology debt,” said Peter Weis, CIO and SVP of Supply Chain Services at ITS Logistics.

“That translates into a higher percentage of our technology spend on innovation and far less on merely keeping the lights on. This allows us to simultaneously grow our tech team in Reno, scale up our offshore development center in India, and invest in the critical innovation skills best found in Silicon Valley.”

The Walnut Creek Technology Innovation Center has been modeled with scalability in mind and will collaborate closely with both Reno and India as ITS continues to accelerate its delivery of market-facing software solutions.

“We’ve already staffed the Center with key talent in architecture, information security, business intelligence, devops, and cloud ERP,” said ITS Logistics VP of Product and Innovation Haris Hamid. “We’re placing what we believe is a smart bet in tapping into what remains the deepest tech talent pool in the country, for tech in general and for next-gen AI in particular.”

The company researched several possible locations for its Tech Innovation Center and chose the Bay Area and Walnut Creek due to its high density of AI-centered talent. According to the venture capital database Pitchbook, over $11.1 billion worth of AI investment went to San Francisco-based firms in Q1 of 2023 alone, which has turned the area into a hub for AI-focused development and expertise.

“Not only are we investing in some of the world’s top talent for AI and machine learning; we’re also benefiting from proximity to our Reno headquarters, so that when face-to-face collaboration is required, we are just a short drive away,” added Hamid. “That proximity translates into cost-effective speed to market.”

Technology remains at the epicenter of ITS Logistics’ growth story. Within the last 12 months, the company has more than quadrupled its digital engagement with customers and carriers through its investments in people, software, and cloud infrastructure.

The foundation of ITS’ tech investments is its custom-developed cloud-based Transportation Management System (TMS), built to manage 100% of its brokerage shipments and enabling the company to “go on offense” through faster delivery of future new tech products.

“We are now far less beholden to outside providers in driving innovation. We control our own destiny in delivering for our customers, limited only by our imagination and commitment,” said Weis. “ContainerAI is an important first product announcement to the market, but it won’t be the last. I couldn’t be more excited about the innovation roadmap that lies ahead, and the Walnut Creek Center will play a vital role in delivering on the promise of that vision.”

Technology usage in the supply chain: the case of small ...,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mcb/ijlm/2006/00000017/00000001/art00004,Автор: P Evangelista,"Purpose ‐ In today's supply chain management practices, a successful strategy depends increasingly on the performance of third party logistics (3PLs) providers as they play a key integrative role linking the different supply chain elements more effectively. Information and communications technology (ICT) has become an important element of 3PL competitive capability as it enables higher levels of supply chain integration. Recent industry developments have widened the technological gap between large and small 3PLs. This is critical particularly for those markets populated by a large number of small 3PLs such as the Italian logistics industry. The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of ICT adoption in small logistics service providers. The focus of the study is the Italian 3PL market. Design/methodology/approach ‐ The methodology adopted in this paper is based on the action research framework and it is a combination of theoretical analysis and empirical findings (focus groups and surveys). Firstly, a literature review on ICT dissemination in the international and Italian 3PL industry has been carried out. Then, a field survey has been developed preceded by two focus groups. The empirical investigation examined a sample of 153 small Italian 3PLs on the base of a definition and taxonomy proposed by the authors. Findings ‐ The results provide a useful technological profile of the surveyed companies, as well as an analysis of the role of ICT in customising services and of the factors influencing ICT adoption. Research limitations/implications ‐ To give a more robust scientific justification of the survey results, it would be useful to carry out an additional large-scale analysis including other countries with a high presence of small logistics service companies. Furthermore, a complementary case-study analysis would be of help in defining the role of specific factors in different types of 3PL. Further investigations in this field are needed to better understand innovation paths, and how ICT can improve the competitive capabilities of 3PLs and of the wider supply chain. Practical implications ‐ Managers of small 3PLs can use the findings to set-up guidelines for improving a company's technology innovation. Technology vendors can use the findings to better market their service/product into the small logistics service provider segment. Originality/value ‐ Despite the fact that much has been written about the dissemination of ICT, there is still a shortage of research in the field of small 3PLs with little empirical investigation into the usage of ICT by small 3PLs. This paper provides a contribution to filling this void and suggests some possible research directions.

Automation Drives the Next Generation of 3PL Fulfillment,https://www.dgdtransport.com/automation-drives-the-next-generation/,N/A,"As more companies push for automation, it continues to make its way into many warehouses and distribution centers around the globe. This can also be seen due to an increase of distribution centers specializing in e-fulfillment.

As the year moves along, many e-commerce distribution centers will be fully recovered from the onslaught of the holidays. This is because the holidays can cause an influx of orders that are not normally seen. When this happens, retail orders are known to jump as high as 20%.

An Evolution of Automation in Fulfilment

In distribution centers across America, automation is not only seen among the conveyor systems. Other innovative solutions also exist in the next-generation of supply chains. These include auto-guided vehicles, pick/put-to-light, wearables, voice-directed technology, robotic applications, and radio frequency identification scanning.

After radiofrequency identification scanning showed up during World War II, it was only utilized as a form of laser and telecommunications technology. It didn’t start making headway until the 21st century when the technology was seen as affordable and easy to use in handheld applications. During the early 2000s advancement turned the technology into voice-activated systems and hands-free RFID technology.

Robotics, on the other hand, didn’t get introduced to manufacturing until 1961. This was when Unimation brought it to General Motors as a new assembly robot.

Ever since the early days, the implementation of robotics has remained focused on manufacturing. Today, however, many vision-guided robots have been introduced to distribution centers. Their main task is to perform retrieval putaway functions, loading/unloading, goods-to-person application, and pallet stacking. The advancement in robotics has grown so much that installations that use robotics had grown by 11% in 2014. According to the International Federation of Robots, an annual 15% growth rate is expected to happen globally.

Over the last five years, Amazon has been the leader in fulfillment by using robotic technology and applications. By 2016, Amazon had increased its robotic applications by 16,000.

Leading the Way in Fulfillment Automation

So when it comes to warehouse automation who is leading the way? With it trending rapidly among certain industries, it still lacks in the global market. As reported by the International Federation of Robots, only 70% of global sales were achieved by robots in five countries.

These countries included:

United States

China

South Korea

Germany

Japan

According to omnichannel e-tailing growth rates, many fulfillment centers have begun to meet the market demand for both next-day and same-day delivery, with high emphasis during the holiday season.

More Information about the four Technology Tracks

IoT and Robo-doctors

The expansion of IoT and AI has created the opportunity for automated monitoring of critical equipment using smart sensing technology. These tools have the potential to significantly reduce maintenance costs and unplanned downtime. In the future, ports will pursue 100% predictive maintenance and repair, autonomous “robot-doctors” with the ability to fix anomalies at greater speed and accuracy and 3-D printers that can print required spare parts on site.

AI and Autonomous Drones

The increasing maturity of artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities combined with reduced costs of drone and geo-spatial technologies, has created unprecedented opportunities to enable fully automated operations, including autonomous inspections and drone-based cargo and container deliveries.

Big Data and Advanced Analytics

Big data technologies are making it easier than ever to gain real-time insights into business operations and perform automated modeling and simulations. These insights can help port operators optimize terminal operations, eliminate supply chain inefficiencies and maximize utilization of infrastructure. In the future, the movement of all physical objects and infrastructure will be digitally recorded and represented to provide perfect insight into operations.

Blockchain

Blockchain technology will revolutionize data exchange processes within ports and global supply chains, drastically reducing shipping transit time and cost, with increased transparency. In the future, “cooperating” robots that take over transport and machine handling will use blockchains to transact and validate, integrating seamlessly with supplier systems and reducing human intervention in document heavy transactions.

Bring Your Own Idea

The above tracks and descriptions are guidelines to the disruptive technologies Gulftainer is looking to embed within its operations. Over and beyond these tracks, we welcome pitches from start-ups that encompass exponential technologies and futuristic business models that will completely disrupt the ports and logistics industry.

"Investcorp Invests in Salla, Saudi Arabia's Leading SaaS e- ...",https://www.investcorp.com/investcorp-invests-in-salla-saudi-arabias-leading-saas-e-commerce-enablement-platform/,N/A,"4 Mar 2024

Investcorp, a leading global alternative investment firm today announced it has led a $130 million pre-IPO investment round in Salla, a leading SaaS E-Commerce enablement platform in Saudi Arabia. The investment was made alongside Sanabil Investment, a wholly owned company by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund. STV, a regional venture capital investor and an existing shareholder of Salla, also participated in the transaction.

Salla was established in 2016 in Makkah to promote the entrepreneurial ecosystem in Saudi Arabia by providing SMEs and aspiring entrepreneurs with a proprietary SaaS solution to deliver on their e-commerce ambitions. Today, Salla enables merchants to tap into a $20 billion e-commerce market expected to grow over 25% year-on-year in the coming years. Since 2020, Salla has enabled $7 billion in e-commerce sales and currently serves over 80 thousand active merchants on the platform.

Founded by Nawaf Hariri and Salman Butt, the Company now has over 160 developers focused on technology and product development. It offers merchants a fully-digitalized and automated solution, allowing them to build their e-commerce website, start selling their products online within a few hours, accept online payments, and ship their products to the end user. Beyond being fully integrated with online payment solutions and logistics companies, Salla has over 400 applications on its platform supporting its merchants throughout the lifecycle of running an online business.

Investcorp’s investment was made through Investcorp Saudi Pre-IPO Growth Fund LP, a platform targeting equity growth capital investments across a range of companies primarily based in Saudi Arabia with the potential to access the capital markets. Additionally, Robin Mansour, Principal at Investcorp will be joining the Board of Directors of Salla.

The Fund allows investors to gain exposure to growing and market-leading businesses in strategic, high-growth sectors such as business services, transport and logistics, healthcare, and consumer.

Investcorp Head of Emerging Markets Private Equity, Walid Majdalani, said, “Saudi Arabia today has over a million SMEs, having grown three times over the past five years. We believe that the Kingdom’s transformation agenda will continue to drive innovation and empower the next generation of entrepreneurs, with Salla acting as a key enabler to support the development of new companies in the e-commerce ecosystem”.

He added, “We see great interest in the potential of Saudi companies to IPO, especially as scale-ups and unicorns demonstrate local and regional success. Salla has managed to grow exponentially and deliver best-in-class margins. We are excited to be part of their next growth phase and are keen to work with the founder and management team to explore a potential future listing in line with our track record”.

Nawaf Hariri, CEO and Co-Founder of Salla, added, “We are deeply grateful for the trust and investment from Investcorp and Sanabil in Salla, which reflects their confidence in our vision and our platform’s potential. This investment propels us forward in our ongoing mission to open opportunities and empower individuals, SMEs, and enterprises to start and expand their businesses both within and beyond Saudi Arabia. We are committed to delivering innovative, customer-centric solutions that simplify and enhance the e-commerce experience for our merchants.”

Investcorp, through Investcorp Saudi Pre-IPO Growth Fund LP, previously led a pre-IPO funding round in TruKKer, a leading MENA digital freight network, with over 45,000 trucks inducted on its platform. This was followed by the fund’s investment in NourNet, one of Saudi Arabia’s leading ICT companies, with over 1,200 B2B clients operating across 20 industries.",trucking technology venture capital
Trukker raises $100m to accelerate growth ahead of ...,https://www.marsgrowth.com/news-rooms/trukker-raises-100m-to-accelerate-growth-ahead-of-planned-ipo,N/A,"Trukker, which provides an Uber-like digital network for lorries and pick-up trucks in the Mena region, has raised $100 million in financing as it seeks to enter new markets and improve its products and services before its planned initial public offering.

The Series C late-stage growth funding round was led by Bahrain-based alternative investment company Investcorp with a $51m investment, Trukker said on Wednesday.

Abu Dhabiâs Mubadala Investment Company, which is an existing investor in the venture, made a follow-on investment in the latest round along with Saudi Arabia-based Riyad Valley Capital, Egypt's Reliance Group and Iraq-based conglomerate March Holding.

""It is a significant achievement for the organisation and its leadership to have closed a late-stage venture round in the current climate in the region,"" Gaurav Biswas, founder and chief executive of Trukker, said.

""It speaks a lot about the strong fundamentals of the business and its solid growth path.""

The latest financing comes after the company undertook a series of technology upgrades, expansions and growth across its home markets in the Middle East and new ones in Turkey and Central Asian nations.

The company plans to use the funds to stimulate growth and ""democratise access to new-age trucking by penetrating deeper into the new and existing marketsâ, it said.

A considerable part of the proceeds will be used for new products and services to add to the automation of its freight network.

âWe have learned and relearned the challenges of supply chain focused on land freight,â Mr Biswas said.

The global road freight industry has grown over the past decades to reach $3.1 trillion in 2020, according to a Frost & Sullivan report.

Although the industry took a severe hit during the Covid-19 pandemic-driven lockdowns and movement restrictions, the consultancy estimates that road freight revenue globally will grow by an average of 4.3 per cent annually from 2020 to 2025.

The pandemic has exposed challenges of the logistics sector, including the shortages of shipping containers and freight delays that have led start-ups such as Trukker to disrupt the space with digital solutions.",trucking technology venture capital
Private Equity,https://www.adia.ae/en/pr/2021/private-equity.html,N/A,"Global deal flow powered to an estimated $1 trillion by value, almost doubling last yearâs volumes and surpassing the previous peak reached in 2006-07. In parallel, many private equity firms came back to the market sooner than expected, raising new, larger funds, while competition for deals and valuations both increased. While deals were spread across sectors, transactions involving technology and tech-enabled businesses featured heavily, with digitisation and ESG emerging as central investment themes for the PE industry.

ADIAâs Private Equities Department (PED) had another busy year, deploying more capital than ever before. Direct investments accounted for 58% of PED's overall deployment in 2021, up from 55% in 2020, with the balance committed to funds. In total, PED completed 40 direct investments in 2021, up from 25 in the previous year, including 12 co-investments in early-stage companies alongside our venture capital partners.

While competition for deals was high in 2021, PED continued to benefit from its sector-driven investment approach, allowing its investment teams to derive insights across the full spectrum of opportunities and enabling better dialogue and alignment with the sector teams of core PE partners. The Departmentâs recent creation of a sector-focused operating advisor network will take this a step further by helping to deepen investment themes and assist with due diligence and value creation more broadly.

PED continued to participate in large transactions during 2021, such as investments in Medline Industries Inc., a privately held manufacturer and distributor of medical supplies, athenahealth, a provider of cloud-based software and outsourced billing services to physicians, Ardonagh, a leading insurance broker, and Mphasis, a global technology services provider.

PED made a number of growth-stage investments and was also able to source attractive off market, follow-on investment opportunities from its growing portfolio. In one such case, PED deployed additional capital as part of the merger of two of its portfolio companies, Constellation Automotive Group and CarNext, both digital marketplaces for used cars.

In addition, the Department continued to be proactive in monitoring and managing its existing portfolio, including using secondaries to concentrate the portfolio on preferred sectors and managers. PED also continued to integrate its venture capital activities into its sector-based portfolio to increase insights and capture later-stage venture and early growth investment opportunities.

From a sector perspective, PED remains highly focused on Technology, including a particular emphasis on enterprise software, which has played a mission-critical role during the pandemic and clearly demonstrated its resilience. Technology also continues to disrupt across sectors as companies contend with the need to modernize IT systems, enhance customer engagement on digital platforms and adapt to evolving workplace behaviours.

As in previous years, Healthcare also remains a priority as it continues to benefit from secular demographic trends, an acceleration in biotechnology innovation, and changes in the way medical products and services are delivered to patients. In addition, PED has increased its focus on early-stage life sciences companies that harness the power of data and artificial intelligence, for example through its participation in the $370m Series B financing of Generate Biomedicines, and $500m Series B financing of Eikon Therapeutics.

In Financial Services, digital transformation was a key theme during 2021, despite some concerns around elevated Fintech valuations. PEDâs portfolio is already well positioned in financial services, with investments in capital intensive businesses that continued to perform well throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.

To capitalise on the ever-changing shifts within the Consumer sector, the Department will continue to seek investments in market-leading companies able to develop powerful, direct relationships with consumers through technology and service. One example of this strategy was the Departmentâs investment in U.S.-based Truck Hero, a branded automotive accessories business.

Based on its strong belief in the regionâs growth potential, several years ago PED created dedicated teams focused on China and India-Southeast Asia. This has allowed it to expand its activity in the region over time and, in 2021, APAC accounted for almost 20% of total deployment. The teamâs deepening GP relationships and ability to lead minority investments generated a number of commitments across India and China, and the Department completed its first investment in Vietnam. PED also completed its first transactions in Indonesia during 2021, leading GoTo Groupâs fundraising round with a $400m investment, and investing alongside the newly-formed Indonesia Investment Authority (INA) in the IPO of telecom towers company Mitratel.

In 2022, PED anticipates a continuation of the high level of competition for attractive companies, choppy IPO markets, and the need to adjust to pandemic-related and geopolitical developments. Against this backdrop, the team will continue to build its internal capabilities, harness insights from its industry practices and operating advisor network, and enhance the quality of its dialogue with GP and corporate partners.",trucking technology venture capital

The company was founded in California in 2016, by a group of Stanford Ph.D. graduates who decided to use their knowledge of artificial intelligence to develop self-driving technology for the long-haul trucking industry.[1] Plus was one of the first companies working on autonomous trucks to receive a California Autonomous Vehicle Testing License the following year, allowing it to test its technology in California.[2]

The company began operating in China during 2018 in addition to the US. Plus also demonstrated its technology in an unmanned truck at Qingdao Port in China that same year.[3] Chinese online freight marketplace, Full Truck Alliance, became an investor in Plus in 2018.[4] In 2019 the company entered into a joint venture with the Chinese truck manufacturer FAW Jiefang.[5][3]

A commercial freight truck using Plus's self-driving technology drove across the U.S. from California to Pennsylvania in December 2019, hauling butter for Land O'Lakes.[6] According to Popular Mechanics, this was the first time that an autonomous freight vehicle had driven across the country delivering goods.[1]

Plus raised two rounds of funding in early 2021. In February 2021, it raised a total investment of $200 million. As an extension to that funding, it raised an additional $220 million in March 2021.[7]

The company announced in May 2021 that it had established a deal to go public through a business combination with the special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC), Hennessy Capital Investment Corp. V.[8][9][10] The companies canceled the planned merger in November 2021, citing regulatory concerns outside of the U.S.[11]

Also in May 2021, Plus carried out a 4,000-mile drive from Suzhou to Dunhuang on China's Silk Road to test the safety and performance of its self-driving system. The truck was autonomous but supervised during the drive.[9]

The following month, Amazon.com made an order to purchase 1,000 self-driving systems from the company.[12][13] Plus had started to deliver its self-driving technology to Amazon in February 2021.[14] In a separate deal, Amazon gained the option to purchase up to a 20% stake in Plus.[12]

The company completed a driverless truck demonstration on the Wufengshan highway in China, in June 2021. The driverless semi truck was operated using Plus's Level 4 autonomous driving technology, without a safety driver or use of any remote controls.[15]

Product and technology [ edit ]

Plus is developing Level 4 self-driving technology for semi trucks.[16] The company developed a self-driving system called PlusDrive intended for use with a driver in the vehicle, which can be retrofitted into commercial freight trucks.[17] Plus has also partnered with truck manufacturers to build self-driving trucks.[3] The company's self-driving system incorporates hardware and software using artificial intelligence.[18] The hardware employed by Plus includes cameras, lidar and radar that together provide a complete view of the truck's surroundings.[1][19] The software processes and makes sense of all data about the truck's surroundings collected through the sensors.[19]

The company has carried out road testing of its technology in 17 states in the U.S. as of 2021.[20] In addition to its own road testing, Plus's technology is independently tested at the Transportation Research Center.[19]

Plus has partnered with truck manufacturers and trucking fleets to introduce its driving systems.[3] It began to roll out its system to companies in China and the U.S. in 2021[12] and announced that it would begin production that year.[19] As of 2021, the company partnered with the European truck manufacturer Iveco[10] to work together on building semi-trucks that could drive autonomously and use liquefied natural gas engines. It also partnered with engine maker Cummins Inc. to develop self-driving trucks fueled by natural gas.[12]

Operations [ edit ]

The company is based in Santa Clara, California,[1] and also has offices in Germany. It carries out testing of trucks in the U.S., Australia, and Europe.[7]

The company is co-founded and led by CEO David Liu,[21] chief operating officer Shawn Kerrigan,[18] chief technology officer Hao Zheng,[22] and chief architect Tim Daly.[2]

In 2023, Plus separated its U.S. and Chinese-focused operations into two independent companies, with the U.S. unit retaining the Plus name and Full Truck Alliance becoming a key shareholder of the Chinese unit, Zhijia Technology.[23]",trucking technology venture capital

€17m raised for the digital freight platform Ontruck,https://www.cathaycapital.com/e17m-raised-for-the-digital-freight-platform-ontruck/,N/A,"€17m raised for the digital freight platform Ontruck

July 15, 2020

Europe

Led by OGCI Climate Investments, the fund of the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative, this funding round brings Ontruck’s total capital to more than 53 million euros.

Cathay Innovation, Atomico, Idinvest Partners and Total Carbon Neutrality Ventures, Ontruck’s historical investors, have also renewed their trust.

Endeavor Catalyst also joined the round as a new investor.

Paris, June 11, 2020 – Ontruck, Europe’s leading digital road freight platform, has completed a €17 million funding round led by OGCI Climate Investments (OGCI). Ontruck’s existing investors, Cathay Innovation, Atomico, Idinvest Partners and Total Carbon Neutrality Ventures, also participated in this round, and welcomed Endeavor Catalyst as a new investor.

This investment will accelerate the development of Ontruck’s transportation network and technology. The start-up also intends to leverage the expertise and resources of OGCI members to achieve a common goal: the development, roll-out and global distribution of innovative low carbon footprint solutions in commercial transportation. OGCI members are drawn from the oil and gas industry and include BP, Chevron, CNPC, Eni, Equinor, Exxonmobil, Occidental, Petrobras, Repsol, Saudi Aramco, Shell and Total.

To date, Ontruck has reduced the percentage of kilometres travelled by empty vehicles from 44% – the industry average – to 19%. This performance, which has prevented 728,000 kg of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere[1], stregnthens the platform’s leadership as a provider of sustainable transport solutions.

“We are honored to welcome OGCI Climate Investments as a new investor,” said Iñigo Juantegui, CEO and co-founder of Ontruck. “OGCI CI shares our ambition to promote a progressive transformation of the €600 billion road transport industry in Europe, specifically through reductions in the millions of tons of carbon generated by trucks driving empty every year.”

Pratima Rangarajan, CEO of OGCI Climate Investments, added: “We are pleased to add Ontruck to our portfolio of low-carbon solutions. Ontruck’s technology demonstrates how increased efficiency can immediately and significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. We look forward to helping them grow faster.”

Since 2016, Ontruck’s first innovations on the market have transformed the logistics industry and established the most efficient and socially responsible platform for road transport.

Ontruck’s freight management technology has automated 90% of load allocations while offering high flexibility to shippers and 100% pickup rates even in emergency situations. To achieve this, the startup uses algorithms to predict peaks in shipping demand, optimize loads and thus carrier movements, and balance the market through dynamic pricing.

In four years, the company has established itself as a major European actor with operations in Spain, the United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands, and with further expansion projects underway. Its management team is made up of successful entrepreneurs, including founders who have guided their companies to successful exits, but also seasoned executives from major transport and logistics companies such as Uber, CH Robinson and XPO Logistics.

Ontruck has built trusted partnerships with some of the largest companies in Europe such as Auchan, Pepsico, P&G, Carrefour, CHEP and Decathlon.

Amogy announces Series A funding round to bring zero ...,https://apventures.com/news/amogy-announces-series-a-funding-round-to-bring-zero-emission-heavy-duty-transport-technology-to-market,N/A,"• Amogy positioned to help decarbonize global transportation sector

• AP Ventures leads the investment round to support commercialization of Amogy’s innovative ammonia-based power technology, joined by new investor Amazon and existing investor DCVC

• Amogy’s emission-free, energy-dense power solution will enable Amazon and leading cargo owners to work toward removing fossil fuels from their supply chains and support the global transition to net zero

New York City, USA – December 14, 2021 – Amogy Inc., a pioneer of emission-free, energy-dense ammonia power solutions, today announced the close of their Series A funding round. Led by AP Ventures, a significant investor in breakthrough hydrogen technologies, and with new investment from Amazon’s Climate Pledge Fund, the round also included San Francisco based fund DCVC. Proceeds will be used to develop the company’s first commercial application for ammonia-powered shipping and other transport applications.

Transportation presents a major challenge on the journey to net zero. While the sector accounts for 17% of global greenhouse gas emissions, zero carbon options for heavy duty sectors, such as maritime, and ground mobility are limited by the power density requirements of these applications. Ammonia is an ideal fuel for these sectors; it can be made green using clean energy, has a significantly higher energy density than batteries and hydrogen, and an existing supply infrastructure which reduces customers’ switching cost. Amogy unlocks the potential of ammonia as a heavy-duty transport fuel via its highly efficient, lightweight, compact ammonia power technology.

“Heavy-duty transportation is the backbone of the global industry, and one of the planet’s imminent challenges when it comes to reaching net zero. The support of our investors will help Amogy continue developing our clean ammonia-to-power technology, which we expect will be one of the most viable solutions for shipping and other transportation applications in the coming years,” said Amogy CEO Seonghoon Woo.

Founded in 2020, Amogy has rapidly developed to be at the forefront of ammonia-based mobility solutions. Leveraging a broad base of proprietary technologies, Amogy’s emission-free power technology offers a truly unique decarbonization tool for the global transportation sector.

“We are delighted to continue our support for Amogy and to lead this investment round. Amogy’s unique ammonia-based technology offers a compelling emission-free transport solution which can fast-track our route to net zero” said Andrew Hinkly, Managing Partner at AP Ventures.

Amogy will use the proceeds of this funding round to advance its first commercial product. Partnering with Amazon, Amogy will work toward the demonstration of an ammonia-powered clean cargo-shipping vessel. From a common technology base, Amogy will then expand the product line to other heavy duty transport applications.

“Decarbonizing maritime shipping is one of the biggest environmental challenges our society faces when it comes to tackling climate change,” said Kara Hurst, vice president and head of Worldwide Sustainability at Amazon. “Amazon is working to transition to zero-carbon fuels for ocean shipping by 2040, which aligns with our company’s broader commitment through The Climate Pledge Fund. We view Amogy’s emission-free solution for powering ocean freight as an important step forward.”

About Amogy

Amogy offers ammonia-based, emission-free, high energy-density power solutions to decarbonize transportation for a sustainable future. Founded by MIT PhD alumni with a shared vision in 2020, Amogy aims to enable clean transportation in all sectors, accelerating the global journey towards Net Zero 2050.

Potential of start-ups focused on AI and other advanced ...,https://www.scmp.com/native/business/banking-finance/topics/all-innovation/article/3263992/potential-start-ups-focused-ai-and-other-advanced-technologies-bright-spot-global-investors,27 мая 2024 г.,"Last month global consulting firm EY reported that, for more than a decade, private markets have enjoyed a remarkable period of sustained growth, with only 2022 recording a slight drop. It said assets under management had risen from US$9.7 trillion in 2012 to an estimated $24.4 trillion by the end of 2023.

The same optimism is reflected in a survey carried out in March and April by HSBC Global Research, which shows that nearly 80 per cent of global investors expect a pickup in venture capital (VC) and private equity activities over the next 12 months.

However, according to the international policy forum Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the global economy is proving resilient, with worldwide gross domestic product growth of 3.1 per cent projected for this year – maintaining last year’s pace – followed by a further pickup to 3.2 per cent next year. These predictions come as inflation continues to ease, and private sector confidence is improving.

High interest rates, geopolitical and recessionary concerns in recent years have weighed on the number of private companies launching initial public offerings (IPO) – where they issue shares for sale to the public for the first time on financial markets – and weak exit market conditions have also slowed global venture funding.

And despite the broader market headwinds, 70 per cent of investors in listed tech companies plan to maintain their tech sector weightings, while 16 per cent intend to increase their stakes, according to the HSBC survey.

Many VC experts remain optimistic that entrepreneurs with the right ideas and plans, especially in advanced technologies – including artificial intelligence (AI), where computer systems can copy intelligent human behaviour, industrial data, and robotics – offer enormous growth potential.

AI tops the agenda of many conversations, especially generative artificial intelligence (gen AI), which leverages machine learning to create new content and accomplish an increasing number of tasks.

HSBC’s “All-in on Innovation” programme in California saw its tech-focused ultra-high-net-worth clients connect with leading venture capitalists, start-ups and entrepreneurs.

In collaboration with HSBC Innovation Banking, HSBC Global Private Banking curated a three-day “All-in on Innovation” programme from May 15 to 17 in California, the United States, offering ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) clients in Asia, who are passionate about the technology sector, a great opportunity to connect with top venture capitalists, promising start-ups and like-minded entrepreneurs. They were given insights on how to thrive in the era of rapid technological change and gain inspiration from tech innovation.

Lok Yim, regional head of Global Private Banking, Asia-Pacific, HSBC, said: “We are pleased to partner with HSBC Innovation Banking to curate this exclusive platform for our UHNW clients to exchange ideas with like-minded investors and draw inspiration from the authentic ingenuity that defines the tech community.

Lok Yim, regional head of Global Private Banking, Asia-Pacific, HSBC, says the “All-in on Innovation” programme in California has helped its wealthy clients to exchange ideas with like-minded investors and gain inspiration from the tech community.

“Our clients choose HSBC because of our profound understanding of the market and our alignment with their sophisticated personal and business needs. This programme epitomises our unparalleled expertise in offering services beyond private banking.

“By tapping into the extensive knowledge and network within HSBC Group, which spans commercial banking and investment banking on a global scale, we demonstrate our commitment to catering to every aspect of our clients’ financial journey.”

Past tech advances show history repeats itself

Many insights were shared and ideas were exchanged during a series of keynote speeches, presentations and panel discussions.

History has shown economic cycles and technological breakthroughs tend to be in locked steps, with the latter serving as an “inflection point” to propel a whole new set of entrepreneurs and a whole generation of companies to success.

One speaker, Scott Kupor, investing partner of US private capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, said current economic conditions and the advent of AI and deep tech, such as big data, machine learning and robotics, bear great similarity to past events such as the launch of Netscape, producer of the world’s first commercialised web browser that went public in 1995, the introduction of the social networking service Facebook in 2004, and the maturation of Software as a Service cloud computing. All these innovations emerged on the back of major market corrections.

Scott Kupor, investing partner of US private capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, talks during the event about how innovations often appear after major market corrections.

Another speaker at the event, Elias Torres, a serial entrepreneur, who is the founder and CEO of the technology firm Novy.ai, is a case in point. He shared how he has been able to employ the new-found power of AI to help his clients increase productivity and drastically improve customer experience while keeping costs in check – things that are especially important during times of economic challenges.

Entrepreneur Elias Torres, founder and CEO of Novy.ai, speaks during the “All-in on Innovation” event about how his company uses AI to help its clients increase productivity.

Financial data and software company PitchBook reported in January that a record US$29.1 billion in funding was spread across 691 generative AI deals last year. This represented a 268 per cent increase in deal value over 2022’s total.

Challenges can help identify next unicorns

Unfavourable business conditions mean that most new companies will choose to remain private, while those that are looking for funding will need to really stand out from the crowd.

However, budding entrepreneurs could actually use these tougher times as an opportunity to see whether they have what it takes to succeed, said Michael Kim, founder of VC firm Cendana Capital, which works with select global seed and pre-seed funds.

Referring to the peaking of VC in tech start-ups in 2021 and 2022, he said he saw many new companies being able to raise a lot of funds, but they were not businesses that had the substance to become successful and profitable.

“You had a lot of people starting companies, [but] they were not necessarily the ones that were passionate, the ones that would walk through walls to get their companies alive,” he said.

Michael Kim, founder of VC firm Cendana Capital (left), and Sherry Lin, senior adviser to US family office Argentum Peak, take part in discussions at the “All-in on Innovation” event.

Essentially, the success of a company depends on what it can offer, and start-ups with the most potential are those with ideas that can make an impact.

Peter Hébert, co-founder and managing partner of Lux Capital, which invests in hard science and advanced technology companies, said that Kurion, a small business venture it had supported, played a vital role in helping to resolve one of the world’s biggest crises – the 2011 Fukushima disaster.

A 9.0-magnitude earthquake off the northeast coast of Japan triggered a tsunami and meltdowns at a nuclear power plant.

Peter Hébert, co-founder and managing partner of Lux Capital, shares stories about how his company supports start-ups with big ideas at the “All-in on Innovation” event.

He said in only eight weeks, the nuclear waste clean-up company designed, built and delivered an external reactor water cooling system to lower the temperature of the molten reactor without the deployment of helicopters and trucks, while safely decontaminating the water.

Kurion has since been bought by Veolia, a French transnational company which specialises in water and waste management and energy services.

Michael Romano, chief business officer of the VC firm, Lightspeed, said: “If you look at the percentage of technology as it relates to the top five companies in the S&P [stock market index] … technology and tech-enabled companies – many of which were originally venture-backed – are increasingly taking up a larger percentage of the total share.”

Another recent development is that a growing number of family offices – privately held companies that handle fund and wealth management for high-net-worth families – are taking an interest in VC funds that support transformative technologies. These institutions tend to be more liquid and their wealth allocations are based on the founder’s vision and passion.

Michael Romano, chief business officer of the venture capital firm Lightspeed, says tech and tech-related companies are increasingly prominent on public indices at the “All-in on Innovation” event.

Professional services company PwC reported last year that almost one-third of the capital received by start-ups worldwide in 2022 came from family offices. Although these institutions are exercising caution in funding nascent businesses because of the continuing market uncertainty, they remain an important source of capital in the start-up ecosystem.

Identifying the right start-ups to support requires specific expertise that a family might not have, so there are strong advantages in choosing a VC fund that has a clear mandate, dedicated staff and procedures to achieve an agreed goal.

“If you don’t have the ability to build an internal team that has expertise, and are looking for the best venture partners, I will seek an experienced fund to funds [which] could guide you to put [in] a small amount, if that’s what you want to do – and learn from them,” Sherry Lin, senior adviser to US family office Argentum Peak, said.

David Sabow, head of Innovation Banking, HSBC USA, says the bank offers specialised teams that support a wide range of innovation businesses and their investors.

David Sabow, head of Innovation Banking, HSBC USA, said: “Venture capital is increasingly a global story. Not only have global markets significantly increased their share of VC investment over the last five years, the sources of capital supporting the VC asset class have increasingly come from every corner of the world.

“As one of the largest international banks in the world, HSBC is uniquely positioned to connect family offices, sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors with the general partners funding the next wave of global transformation. Our Innovation Banking teams in the US, UK, Tel Aviv and Hong Kong deliver globally-connected, specialised banking experts to support a broad range of innovation businesses and their investors.”

The event also included two immersive tours in Palo Alto to Playground Global, an early-stage investment company known for nurturing groundbreaking ideas, and Stanford Medical Centre, part of Stanford University, where participants witnessed life-saving transformations through AI-powered medical operations.

Maggie Ng, general manager and head of Wealth and Personal Banking, Hong Kong, HSBC, says the “All-in on Innovation” thought leadership programme helps to connect its private banking clients with a realm of frontier technologies and innovations.

Maggie Ng, general manager and head of Wealth and Personal Banking, Hong Kong, HSBC, said: “This thought leadership programme is our latest initiative to connect our private banking clients with the realm of frontier technologies and innovations which drive growth in every industry.

“Drawing on resources from HSBC’s global network, this immersive tour is carefully designed to provide valuable insights from visionary venture capitalists and start-up entrepreneurs, inspiring our UHNW clients on their wealth journey. It complements our established service approach, which is based on insights, knowledge, and professional expertise.”

Denso, headquartered in Kariya, Aichi prefecture, Japan, is a global supplier of advanced technology, systems and components in the areas of thermal, powertrain control, electronics and information and safety.

Denso and Intel Capital co-led the investment, which is an oversubscribed Series A investment round, to help accelerate Peloton’s development and deployment of platooning technology.

Platooning technology uses vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) wireless communication and radar to pair trucks to travel closely together and thus create an aerodynamic system that is similar to drafting in race cars, Denso explained. The direct communication system provides a way for trucks to ‘talk’ with each other and safely follow another truck with the same features to improve braking and acceleration time, increase safety and reduce fuel costs.

“Denso is excited to build a strong relationship with Peloton,” said Tony Cannestra, director of corporate ventures for Denso International America, Inc. “As a leader in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technologies, we are eager to work closely with Peloton to implement the first large-scale deployment of a V2V system. Denso believes that Peloton’s system has the potential to help increase safety and fuel savings in the transportation industry.”

Denso is making a renewed push into the North American heavy-duty market, recently announcing a research-and-development staff to be located in Southfield, MI, and San Diego. That staff will focus on more efficient diesel fuel systems. Other areas its interested in exploring include electric no-idle HVAC and communication systems to allow roadways and vehicles to interact with each other.",trucking technology venture capital

"Interview with Olly Craughan, Head of Sustainability at DPD",https://www.dpd.co.uk/content/about_dpd/press_centre/interview-with-olly-craughan-head-of-sustainability-at-dpd.jsp,N/A,"Interview with Olly Craughan, Head of Sustainability at DPD

Olly Craughan is Head of Sustainability at DPD UK, and has been named the No.1 Decarbonisation 'Power Player' by Motor Transport magazine in 2023.

Thanks for joining us, Olly. Can you tell us a little bit about DPD's sustainability mission?

Absolutely. As a parcel courier, one of the largest in Britain, we have an impact on the environment, and we recognise that because of this, DPD have an obligation to make sure we're doing everything possible to be sustainable.

Our goal is to be net zero by 2040, and we have a 2030 target to reduce our emissions by 43% (baseline 2020). These aren't empty words. As part of our parent group, Geopost, we're fully validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), which means they've looked at our plans in detail and determined that they're realistic.

What's the biggest change to DPD as a business that you've overseen as part of this net zero 2040 goal?

Bringing in more electric vehicles (EVs) to DPD was a clear priority. We had just 139 EVs in 2020, but we closed 2023 with 3,600. That's an incredible increase of over 2400%. That also represents almost a third of our final mile fleet.

Six years ago we were only delivering around 30,000 parcels a year on EVs. Last year DPD managed to hit 64 million. This year we want to smash that record by achieving 100 million parcels delivered sustainably on our all-electric vans.

What difficulties have you found in this transition? How are you overcoming them?

Our HGVs pose a problem as the technology to electrify them while still maintaining their shipping power is less developed. One solution is Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO), an alternative to diesel made from waste cooking oil. HVO is compatible with our diesel engines and offers a reduction in CO2e of up to 90% compared to diesel. We're investing over £10 million a year into HVOs, and last year alone we increased the proportion of our HGVs that use HVOs from 10% to 95%.

On top of that, this year we will be trialling both electric and hydrogen fuel cell HGVs, which are critical in achieving our net zero ambition.

Hydrogen-powered vehicles sound like an innovative development. Are there other new technologies DPD is experimenting with?

One of the most exciting things we've done in recent years is roll out automated, robot deliveries. We launched our first robot in Milton Keynes in July 2022. We had one, initially, named Evie. DPD parcel recipients are notified of a robot delivery in advance, and once they confirm that they are at home to receive the parcel, the robot is dispatched. They can track the robot's progress on a map, and then use a PIN code to open the secure compartment and access their parcel. Once the compartment is closed, the robot continues its journey to the next recipient. Because they're electric it means we're less reliant on diesel vans which is always going to be a key priority for DPD moving into the future.

The experiment in Milton Keynes has been such a huge success that we decided to roll out robot deliveries to ten more depots across the UK. Raunds was the first, and its robot went live last year. Already in 2024, we've had Bristol and Leeds receive robots, and people living in Hinckley should keep an eye out for their local delivery robot soon delivering their parcel. People really seem to be loving the DPD robots too - they are pretty cool, and people want them in their postcode.

That's an exciting development. Deliveries are clearly somewhere DPD can make an impact, but what about your depots and other sites?

Infrastructure is another big area we're being very careful to consider. DPD recently opened a new regional sortation centre in London Docklands - and we were very keen to make sure we were getting everything right on the sustainability front. First of all, it has 500 EVs, making it completely electric. It generates 1.2 Mw of energy from solar panels, and all of the furniture at the site is made from recycled or sustainable materials. We see Docklands as a model for other new depots to follow as we continue to expand.

Additionally, we recently invested £300,000 to launch a sustainable business incubator programme: the EcoLaunchpad. Here we invite companies to pitch new solutions to address CO2 reduction in our transport fleet and buildings infrastructure. This initiative led to us recently winning the 'Supply Chain Innovation' award at the Retail Technology Innovation Hub awards.

It's not just about improving our fleet and infrastructure, though. We do what we can to give back to our communities. For example, we've partnered with Treeapp - which means for every 10 deliveries made by an EV to a consumer using the DPD app, Treeapp will plant a tree. So far this has resulted in 200,000 trees being planted. We've also donated £90,000 to wetlands restoration in Nottinghamshire. On top of that, we've donated over £650,000 since the start of 2020 from the sale of shrink wrap and pallets to environmental good causes, such as WWF and RSPB. We also recycle 90% of our waste, which is 20% higher than in 2019.

We also appointed volunteer Energy Champions at all sites to promote sustainability awareness and to find and identify CO2 savings opportunities.

Thanks, Olly. So where does DPD go from here?

We want 4,000 electric vehicles by the end of this year. This means that 40% of our final mile fleet will be electric. 30 cities across the UK will also have electric-only delivery. By 2030 we want 100% of our final mile fleet to be EVs. We want 100% of our HGV fleet to be using HVOs, also. I also mentioned that we want 100 million parcels delivered by an EV this year, and I'm excited to see that happen. DPD really believe we can be the leading sustainable parcel delivery firms across the UK.

Our efforts have resulted in a reduction in carbon emissions by over a third since 2020. We're very proud of this fact at DPD and will continue to push forward to reach our net zero ambitions.",parcel delivery startup incubator

The ZEBOX community, which now comprises 20 partners and over 200 startups, has contributed to raising over £200 million in funding and has initiated more than 100 co-innovation projects between startups and corporate partners for the next generation of solutions.

Since CMA CGM first established an office in Liverpool in 1990, the Group has significantly expanded its presence and now counts 6,000 staff members across five offices, including the Group’s Europe regional office which is now based in London. In the UK, the CMA CGM Group operates 26 maritime services calling at 10 ports, 130 monthly vessel calls, and 87 warehouses through its subsidiary CEVA Logistics. With CEVA Logistics, the Group is able to meet its customers’ logistics needs in the UK through a comprehensive range of supply chain solutions. With its UK headquarters in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, in Leicestershire, CEVA Logistics offers a broad range of end-to-end, customised solutions in contract logistics and air, ocean, ground and finished vehicle transport.

CMA CGM has flagged two LNG powered container ships with the UK Ship Register this year, with more expected to follow in 2024. This move demonstrates CMA CGM’s ongoing commitment to the UK and optimism for the future.

Audrey Dolhen, Regional Director, Head of Europe Region of the CMA CGM Group, said “The launch of ZEBOX UK truly illustrates CMA CGM’s commitment to our UK customers, partners and team members. Our desire is to find innovative approaches and bring solutions to the table that will transform the industry and help the UK adapt to the ever-changing business landscape. CMA CGM and ZEBOX UK are on a mission to create the premier centre of innovation for supply chain and logistics in the United Kingdom.”",parcel delivery startup incubator

The world's most efficient and environmentally friendly ...,https://greenshippingprogramme.com/about-green-shipping-programme/,N/A,"The Green Shipping Programme (GSP), a public-private partnership, aims to advance the Norwegian government’s maritime strategies and plans. The programme’s vision is to develop and strengthen Norway’s goal to establish the world’s most efficient and environmentally friendly shipping.

GSP was first established in January 2015 under the name “the Green Coastal Shipping Program”, consisting of 16 private companies and organisations, as well as two government ministries. In the spring of 2019, the program changed its name to the Green Shipping Programme to state its international ambitions.

In the autumn of 2023, the program included more than 94 private companies and organizations as well as 12 public observers. The Green Shipping Programme is financed partly by public allocations from the State budget of Norway and partly by the members themselves.

This is GSP in a nutshell:

We generate knowledge through studies

We start pilots

We exchange knowledge between theory and practice

We scale up pilots

And we facilitate dialogue and collaboration between all stakeholders in the shipping industry, enabling them to make informed decisions

By spring 2022, the program has initiated over 45 green pilot projects, of which 17 have been realized or are under development.

Harald Solberg, CEO of the Norwegian Shipowners’ Association, and leader of the steering group in the Green Shipping Program. “Reduced emissions from the shipping industry have a high focus both in the industry and from the Norwegian authorities at all levels. Through the Green Shipping Programme we can utilize the full potential from the maritime cluster and together collaborate to realize good ideas. By sharing knowledge and experience, we are convinced that new technology and new solutions can be scaled and give the industry international advantage and be more competitive. Due to a fast development, the industry also needs to rapidly adapt to this change. The Green Shipping Programme provides a good basis for realizing groundbreaking pilot projects.”

The goal of the programme

Our vision: Establish the world’s most efficient and environmentally friendly shipping.

The Green Shipping Program’s overall goal is to contribute to feasible solutions that ensure efficient and environmentally friendly shipping to achieve the national and international climate goals. More specifically, the goals are to achieve cost-effective emission reductions, economic growth, sustainable logistics solutions, increased competitiveness, and new jobs.

Norwegian shipping can become a showcase in the world, an incubator and platform for Norwegian exports of environmental technologies and green transport services. Authorities and business participate in the program and collaborate on how we can achieve these goals together.

Climate target: 50% reduction and zero-emissions ports within ten years

Norwegian authorities have set ambitious goals. Greenhouse gas emissions shall be reduced by 50 percent by 2030 for domestic shipping and fishing – a huge challenge. To reach the goal, we must have approximately 700 low-emission ships and 400 zero-emission ships in 2030, distributed over all ship categories

In addition, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has set the ambition to halve emissions from shipping by 2050. This means that the global market for green technologies and solutions will soon be a reality.

Goals set and result achieved

Since its start-up in 2015, the Green Shipping Program has been developed through defined phases.

Phase 1: Assess the potential for battery and gas-powered maritime transport in Norway (2015/2016)

Goal: Identify emissions and the potential for emission reductions, as well as the effect on industry and exports. Start up five pilots in each phase going forward.

Results: Five pilots were started up

Two studies and five pilot projects identified great opportunities for Norway.

A barrier study for green ferry tenders (for county municipals) was carried out, which contributed greatly to the ferry revolution in Norway and the electrification of international shipping. Electrification has grown from 15 to 450 battery ships in 5 years, with 40% Norwegian market share and Norway in the lead on the supplier side. The program has helped to spread knowledge in society, create debate and make informed decisions.

In 2015, the Green Shipping Program was awarded the Lloyd’s List Global Environmental Prize.

Phase 2: Evaluating business cases in the industry (2016/2017)

Goal: Define the way forward and analyse the business and economic consequences of measures. Raise concrete challenges and opportunities for the Norwegian Parliament and Government. Start up five new pilots.

Results: A sea chart for green coastal shipping was prepared and handed over to the government’s expert committee for green competitiveness.

An open debate with top leaders from business, government and politics in Norway was established.

Competitive and predictable electricity prices were seriously put on the political agenda with the aim of achieving a plug-in hybridisation of coastal shipping. The Green Shipping Program was recognized as a formal project to promote the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

The Program promoted the need for a national plan for green fuels.

A monthly newsletter was established.

Five new pilots were established

Phase 3: Removing barriers to green solutions (2018/2019)

Goal: Answer the most important analytical questions related to the green transition, through studies of barriers, opportunities, and policy instruments. The focus will be on cargo ships, speedboats, ferries, fishing vessels, services for the aquaculture industry and for oil companies, as well as moving cargo from road to sea and ports for an efficient green transition.

Results: The Government’s strategy for green competitiveness with a focus on green framework conditions and the establishment of early markets for the use of green technologies was implemented.

Several buyers of maritime services joined the Green Shipping Program. The financial industry did the same.

The second edition of the debate with top leaders from business, government, and politics in Norway was conducted. Focus on international market opportunities was raised to government level.

Started up five new pilots.

Phase 4: Develop and scale green solutions in Norway (2019/2020)

Goal: To increase the scope of the program by piloting more green logistics solutions, technologies, fuels, and financial solutions. Providing evidence-based input to the government’s planning work. Focus on cargo ships and coastal shipping, as well as public procurement and moving cargo from road to sea. Increased visibility.

Results: Arranged round table conference with the Norwegian Prime Minister and some twenty Norwegian top leaders

Arranged business and environmental policy debate during Arendal Week 2019

Start-up of GSP Service Center for fleet renewal of cargo ships

Involvement in IMO GreenVoyage-2050 Provided input to six government plans and reports to the Parliament

Established new graphic profile and website

Started up 13 new pilots

Phase 5: Develop and scale green solutions in Norway and internationally (2021/2022)

Goal: To increase the scope of the program by piloting more green logistics solutions, technologies, fuels, and financial solutions. Focus on cargo ships, offshore wind, autonomous ferries, services for the aquaculture industry and for oil companies, as well as green public and private procurement and moving cargo from road to sea. Contribute to increased green competitiveness for exports. Further develop GSP’s role in the development of international, green markets, e.g. through the IMO’s GreenVoyage-2050.

Results: Ongoing



Phase 6: Piloting for scaling and green growth (2023/2024)

Goal: In this phase, the Green Shipping Programme will emphasize zero-emission fuel through increased involvement of cargo owners, financial institutions, energy players and authorities.

In this phase, the program will also prioritize competitive shipbuilding in Norway as part of moving more shipyard production home and thereby strenghten the entire Norwegian maritime cluster. In sum: contribute to increased green competitiveness for exports.

GSP will also contribute to Norway establishing a global leadership position in green and blue maritime ammonia operation.

Results: Ongoing

Thank you to those customers who have shown patience in the wake of the significant weather events over the last couple of months. The impact of Cyclone Gabrielle has resulted in closures on key State Highway routes from slips and washouts, and in many cases full sections of roads becoming unpassable. Continued wet weather has delayed reinstatement of affected roads or caused further damage to roading infrastructure. Impacted State Highway connections to Northland, Gisborne/Tairawhiti, Hawke’s Bay, and parts of the Coromandel have necessitated the use of alternate routes, incurring additional time and distance in order to maintain freight services into these areas.

hese are the key roading corridors affected and alternative routes currently in use:

In relation to SH5 (Napier – Taupo), Waka Kotahi has announced the introduction of convoys on a restricted basis. These will operate Tuesday to Friday with limited timings. While it is pleasing to see the facilitation of convoys on this route, the scheduled times sit outside our normal transit windows, and for the majority of our movements, we must continue to run via SH1 and SH2. As a result of these roading disruptions, and with no clear indication of when these critical roading connections will reopen, we have little option other than to introduce a disruption surcharge to recognise the additional costs that have already been incurred. As of Monday 20 March 2023, the following surcharges by respective corridor will be applied to all Mainfreight deliveries. We will notify you if your order will incue this surcharge.

DPDgroup drone delivers parcels using regular ...,https://www.suasnews.com/2016/12/dpdgroup-drone-delivers-parcels-using-regular-commercial-line/,N/A,"DPDgroup drone delivers parcels using regular commercial line

The General Directorate for Civil Aviation (DGAC) has authorised DPDgroup, the international express subsidiary of Le Groupe La Poste, to operate a regular commercial line in the Var department of France.

Following two years of tests, crowned with success, DPDgroup, GeoPost’s international parcel delivery network and international express subsidiary of Le Groupe La Poste, received authorisation from the General Directorate for Civil Aviation to deliver parcels using drones on a regular 15km route.

https://youtu.be/CpSrTSPh9Hw

For the first time worldwide, a regular commercial route makes it possible to deliver parcels by drone.

Once a week, the DPDgroup drone travels between Saint-Maximin-La-Sainte-Beaume and Pourrières, in south of France (Provence region). The route makes it possible to delivery items to a cut-off incubator of companies including a dozen start-ups specialized in technology. Their parcels now delivered by Chronopost and DPD France will be sent by drone from the Pick-up point in Saint-Maximin.

This represent a new way of addressing the issue of last-mile deliveries, especially when it comes to areas that are difficult to access.

For both the departure and arrival of the drone, a delivery terminal is used to secure the parcel loading phases, from take-off to landing and placement of the parcel.

The terminal features:

a structure protecting access to the drone during landing and take-off phases,

an automated carriage system for transporting the parcel,

an electronics system devoted to the safety of handling operations around the drone

A long-standing project

It was back in June 2014 that DPDgroup, in partnership with Atechsys, an SME based in south of France, begin conducting tests to develop the drone. After numerous tests and over 600 hours of flight time, the DPDgroup drone demonstrated, in September 2015, its ability to fly in complete autonomy as it transported a parcel weighing 1.5kg over 14km.

These tests validate the approach chosen by DPDgroup aiming to use drones to access cut-off areas (mountains, islands, rural areas, etc.) or areas that are difficult to access.

The first commercial line represents a new step in the program being led by DPDgroup. After the testing phase, the experimentation phase on the regular route can now begin.

Technical features:

Range: up to 20km

Payload: up to 3kg

Max speed: 30km/h

Navigation system capable of transmitting up to 50km

6 electric rotors, carbon fibre chassis

Latest-generation embedded electronics

On-board GPS and camera with live data stream

Redundant electronics

How Matternet Plans to Become the UPS of Drone Delivery ...,https://futurestores.wbresearch.com/blog/matternet-ups-of-drone-delivery-service-strategy,N/A,"brought to you by WBR Insights







Companies such as Amazon and Google normally dominate any conversation regarding drone delivery systems. However, tech startup, Matternet is looking to bring UAV-powered delivery to the masses.

Andreas Raptopoulos was first inspired to found Matternet when he realised one billion people around the world did not have reliable road access to their homes and often encountered difficulties accessing critical supplies such as medicine. His idea was validated while touring Papua New Guinea with aid organisation Medicins Sans Frontieres when their 20-truck convoy became stranded in mud. He knew a global network of drones could address these problems and change the way delivery services all over the world operate.

Today, Matternet has recruited a strong team of industry experts, has graduated from startup accelerator, Alchemist, and is ready to take on the world.

UPS for Drone Delivery

While being able to deliver essential supplies to some of the world's most inhospitable locations is a fantastic idea with the potential to greatly benefit mankind, the vision for Matternet expands beyond these noble ideals.

(Video source: youtube.com)

The grand plan is to create a global network of Matternet Stations. Customers who need to send a package can then scan it at one of the stations and feed it into a special slot. The parcel is then loaded into a drone and autonomously delivered to the designated destination station. The drone then returns to its home base to refuel, ready for the next delivery.

The drone can select from one of five batteries before taking off, ensuring it will always have enough power to complete its journey. The stations have even been designed to allow packages to be ""leap-frogged"" from one to another, enabling the Matternet network to cover even greater distances.

""Applying on-demand delivery to e-commerce could help people move away from buying in advance and storing goods, into an economy where we transact goods in real time with low latency and friction,"" said Andreas Raptopoulos, co-founder and CEO of Matternet. ""That could mean less road congestion, improved air quality, and shipping costs so low they don't even register as an expense. In our view, the bottom-line benefit will be to make our cities far more liveable.""

Mercedes-Benz

A partnership with Mercedes-Benz is allowing Matternet drones to reach even more locations.

(Video source: youtube.com)

Mercedes vans with built-in Matternet Stations can drive as close to the destination as possible. From there, the drone can take off and carry the package the rest of the way. Until Matternet Stations are a common sight around the globe, the partnership with Mercedes is a great way to expand the operational range of the service - especially when one considers the company's original raison d'etre.

With the van/drone delivery system, Matternet can begin operations straight away, before they've established their network of stations. The program is currently being tested in Zurich, Switzerland, with plans to roll it out globally when all the necessary regulatory approval has been obtained.

""If we succeed, we expect to expand the Zurich delivery service to other hospitals in Switzerland, and then to e-commerce solutions in Europe, the US and Japan,"" said Raptopoulos. ""Achieving this level of scale should reduce the cost dramatically, making our technology viable in parts of the world where the infrastructure is broken. Just as cell phone networks have leapfrogged the wired Internet in some places, on-demand delivery could leapfrog the limitations of ground-based infrastructure.""

Final Thoughts

Delivering aid to some of the world's most isolated and inhospitable locations is reason enough to establish a drone delivery network such as the one proposed by Matternet. However, with the additional ambition of creating a global parcel delivery system, Matternet is looking to change the way everyone sends and receives packages.

The final word goes to Andreas Raptopoulos. ""Imagine if customers could receive small packaged goods in less than an hour, instead of a day or a week. The time and cost savings could change how goods are purchased and consumed, with far-reaching consequences across the supply chain and to people's lives. No one knows how this will play out exactly. It is really exciting to apply our technology to create the kind of future we want to live in.""

Thanks to this mechanism, the market is fair: there is no cronyism linked to the reputation of the label; only the designation of origin and the producer’s price-quality ratio are important.

In summary, Viniexport.com replicates on a global scale the stock market mechanism with which the wine and alcohol buying monopolies of Scandinavia and Canada have been operating for decades.

The latter, thanks to the smart label on the wine bottle (QR Code), will be able to verify the digital “identity card” from its digital media (smartphones or other mobile devices) from property to the entire process of cultivation, production and processing of wine, until its distribution.

www.ezlab. it

wikiVinum – It is a project born in Aosta, which began in 2016 and for which the business model is not yet well defined, but was created with the aim of spreading the culture of wine in a simple but complete way worldwide, through a mobile app in wiki style, that is, as an online encyclopedia, managed synergistically by winemakers and users. A tool that contains all the knowledge, stories and curiosities over the wide and often little-known universe of wine, which allows producers and winemakers to take advantage from enhancing their work and the art-related traditions and knowledge of winegrowing. A highly respected information database, which required two years of work and is constantly evolving. Currently, this startup is underway to develop a system allowing to associate a unique and unrepeatable code for each product, read with the Scan feature from the app, thanks to which the consumption of each product is tracked in real time and worldwide.

With the advice of oenologists and craftsmen, each client will be able to actively and interactively follow step by step through multimedia content, dedicated communications and vineyard encounters, all the production cycle at the base of their own wine. And make “your own wine”, 300 bottles. The price is determined on the basis of the choices made by the customer and will include: the cost of grapes, winemaking and all materials, including bottles, graphic design of the label and packaging, the value of professional advice and timely availability of oenologists.

SeaAhead and New England Aquarium announce launch ...,https://www.neaq.org/about-us/press-room/press-releases/seaahead-and-new-england-aquarium-announce-launch-of-blueswell-incubator-program/,N/A,"Applications now open for innovators looking to bring ocean sustainability solutions out of the lab

BOSTON, MASS. (June 18, 2020) – SeaAhead, Inc. and the New England Aquarium have announced the launch of the BlueSwell Incubator Program (BlueSwell), New England’s first dedicated, comprehensive early-stage bluetech incubator. BlueSwell is designed to support the creation and growth of startups with solutions that have the potential for significant impact on ocean sustainability and global resilience.

BlueSwell will catalyze new business creation by providing a direct (non-dilutive) grant of $35,000 to founders with a new ocean-related technology or business model innovation. Areas of particular opportunity for entrepreneurs include offshore renewable energy, sustainable seafood, maritime decarbonization, marine pollution, and resilient waterfronts. The program builds on New England’s diverse and unique ocean-related capabilities to provide a support infrastructure for new businesses, including direct access to leaders and experts from industry, academia, government, and ocean conservation. The BlueSwell program includes a tailored 20-week curriculum, mentorship from SeaAhead and the Aquarium’s research arm, the Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life, an extended network of advisors, and coworking for the length of the program.

The BlueSwell Program will be located at the SeaAhead Bluetech Innovation Hub at CIC (Cambridge Innovation Center) Boston. The Bluetech Innovation Hub opened in 2019 as the first ocean-focused coworking space in Boston, with the goal of connecting the venture ecosystem in Boston’s urban core with relevant industry and ocean-related research institutions throughout New England. CIC has a strong track record of helping to grow new economic clusters in Greater Boston and recognized early the potential this sector has to drive economic growth in the region.

The New England Aquarium’s 50-year history as a regional leader in global ocean conservation reflects its mission to be a catalyst for global change through public engagement, innovative scientific research, and advocacy. “Human use of our ocean is vital to global health and the economy, including food and energy security, commerce, and the climate crisis,” said Dr. John Mandelman, Vice President and Chief Scientist at the New England Aquarium. “At the same time, this must be done responsibly and collaboratively, and an influx of new methods and technologies are helping to pave the way. The Northeast region contains both a thriving innovation landscape and robust set of ocean experts and assets, and through this program, we aim to combine these elements to foster sustainable, balanced, and equitable use of the ocean.”

SeaAhead’s Executive Director, Alissa Peterson, added, “Emerging businesses require a community to invest in their success—including mentorship, seed capital, and access to government, university, and corporate resources. Through BlueSwell we will support a diverse group of new bluetech founders as they bring their technologies out of the lab. The program will provide a critical bridge for new venture ideation tied to ocean sustainability, building the skills and knowledge base required for founders to raise commercial capital to support their growing startups.”

The BlueSwell program is free to the selected entrepreneurs, which is made possible by sponsoring foundations, companies and individuals that prioritize the ocean as a source of solutions, including Giant Shoulders and Goodwin Proctor.

Applications opened for the program on June 18, 2020 and will close on August 9, 2020. A webinar will be held on Friday, June 26 at 10 a.m. ET to review the program and applications. Please see the website for more information.

The framework conditions and the progression of the ""Ettlingen bringt's"" project are almost identical to the ""deliveRT” project - both are inner-city delivery concepts for emission-free pooling and delivery. Therefore, the following paragraph is taken from the ""deliveRT"" description with minor changes.

The concept centers on a micro-hub close to the city center at the Transport Betz company, where parcels from different parcel service providers or from retailers are collected and from there, in the next step, are delivered in a consolidated manner within the city center. The delivery location may be either a parcel locker, a parcel store or the customer's personal address. Currently, there is already a parcel locker on Thiebauthstraße in downtown Ettlingen. By specifying the Micro-Hub address as the delivery location and a personal identification number in the c/o address line, parcels are assigned and consolidated in the Micro-Hub. The citizens of Ettlingen then receive their parcels by emission-free delivery using electrified cargo bicycles at a freely selectable time to a location of their choice (for example, a parcel locker).",parcel delivery startup incubator

Logistics Startups Prepare Shipping's Strategy to Prevent ...,https://www.mime.asia/logistics-startups-prepare-shippings-strategy-to-prevent-corona-virus/,N/A,"Several logistical startups have recorded an increase in shipments of up to 80% since the corona virus outbreak broke out in Indonesia. Companies such as Paxel, J&T, Prahu Hub, Ninja Xpress, Gojek to Grab have also prepared strategies to prevent Covid-19 transmission from shipping goods.

COO Paxel Zaldy Ilham Masita explained the company recorded an increase in shipments of food and fresh food ingredients to reach 80% in the last 10 days. The majority of clients are micro small and medium enterprises or MSMEs as well as traders in the market. There is also e-commerce.

“Our couriers are equipped with masks and cloth gloves so they can be washed again, as well as hand sanitizers. All of our operational locations are also cleaned with disinfectant every day,” Zaldy said, Monday (3/23).

He complained that his party had difficulty getting personal protective equipment with large quantities and affordable prices. In fact, personal protective equipment becomes a rare item, even though it is needed every day so that the courier team can help the MSMEs still be able to sell.

Not Only Paxel, J&T Also Recorded an Increase in Shipments

In line with Paxel, J&T Express CEO Robin Lo said that the company also noted an increase in freight shipments since the outbreak of the corona virus broke out. At present, 60% to 70% of the company’s goods shipping transactions come from e-commerce.

Robin explained that his party had prepared several preventative measures to prevent the spread of the corona virus through the shipment.

“We require all employees, especially couriers to use masks, maintain personal hygiene by diligently washing hands especially as often as possible before package delivery. We also instruct to spray disinfectants on all branches and every package that is sent,” Robin said.

Prahu Experienced a Decline In Shipments Due to Corona virus Outbreak

In contrast to Paxel and J&T, Prahu Hub CEO Benny Sukamto said there has been a decline in shipments of goods since the outbreak of the corona virus broke out. However, the company considers that the impact of the decline has not been too significant.

“But we believe that over time, basic needs will still be there, and the public will glance at how to work without the need to leave home, that’s where our opportunities will be even greater,” Benny said, Monday (3/23) .

Prahu also implemented a similar move by Paxel and J&T in preventing the spread of the corona virus through shipping goods. While Gojek and Grab’s food and food delivery service have another strategy to prevent the spread of the corona virus.

Gojek Builds Services without Physical Contact for Mutual Safety

Gojek Chief Operations Officer Hans Patuwo said the company had built services without direct physical contact or contactless delivery to protect Go-food and Go-send customers and customer partners.

“We provide text messaging options in the chat feature. We do this so that all parties, including our driver-partners, can be minimized from the possible transmission,” Hans said in a press release on Sunday (3/22).

Grab Indonesia’s Managing Director Neneng Goenadi said, the company already has a contactless booking service. “GrabFood and GrabExpress customers can follow the Contactless Ordering guide available in the application or by following three easy steps,” Neneng said in a post on his website.

The three steps include informing the driver’s partner to place an order outside the door or a certain location, such as a building receptionist. Furthermore, the driver-partner will notify the customer when they have arrived at the delivery location, place the order in the designated place, and wait for the customer to take the order where they will stand at least 2 meters from the order.

Finally, the company advises customers to choose non-cash payments. If the use of cash is unavoidable, the customer can put the money in an envelope and put it in a pre-determined order.",parcel delivery startup incubator

BOSTON, MASS. (May 20, 2021) – Following an exciting inaugural cohort, SeaAhead, Inc. and the New England Aquarium are pleased to open the application period for the next cohort of the BlueSwell Incubator program, a first of its kind program in the Northeast focused on supporting early stage entrepreneurship in bluetech.

BlueSwell is designed to help with the creation and growth of startups that have the potential for significant impact on ocean sustainability and global resilience. The incubator, which officially launched in June 2020 as a partnership between SeaAhead and the New England Aquarium, focuses on bridging the gaps between innovators, ocean experts, industries, and the venture community. BlueSwell leverages SeaAhead’s bluetech domain expertise, network, and experience in building companies, and the Aquarium’s five decades as a global leader in ocean conservation research and as a trusted steward to the oceans.

“Our vision is to create a thriving community of innovators commercializing solutions that will have a meaningful impact on ocean health. The program is philanthropically funded and does not take equity, so we can take significant risk in backing new cutting-edge business models,” said Alissa Peterson, co-founder and Executive Director of SeaAhead. “The program goal is to assist each cohort member on their path to commercial traction. Early stage bluetech entrepreneurs need assistance that can range from customer discovery to preparation for fund raising in this emerging venture sector.”

Six startups were selected for the first BlueSwell cohort, which took place from November 2020 through April 2021. The program provides teams with (1) $35,000 of funding to get their organizations off the ground, (2) access to leaders from industry, investment, academia, government, and NGOs, (3) a cohort of peer companies to learn from, and (4) mentorship and a curriculum designed to improve their leadership skills and business acumen. The teams from Cohort I include AKUA, a company creating food from ocean-farmed kelp, and Hydronet, which aims to build and operate high-speed Wi-Fi communication networks underwater. The group has now already collectively raised over $3 million to scale their startups, and four have pilots either underway or set to launch in early 2021.

“It has been inspiring to watch the Cohort I companies grow through the program,” said John Mandelman, Vice President and Chief Scientist at the Aquarium’s Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life. “The ocean is invaluable to humans but also vulnerable to negative impacts from our activities, such as climate change. With increasing ocean use, we must keep it healthy, including safeguarding ocean habitats, species and ecosystems. Excitingly, we believe innovative technological solutions, such as those from our recent BlueSwell Cohort 1 graduates, can help solve many of the challenges facing our ocean today and are key to driving the responsible growth of the blue economy.”

Applications opened for the program’s second cohort on May 20, 2021 and will close on July 1, 2021 at 5 p.m. ET. A webinar will be held on June 3 to review the program and application process. Please see the website for more information. The BlueSwell program is free to the selected entrepreneurs, which is made possible by sponsoring foundations, public sector entities, companies, and individuals that prioritize the ocean as a source of solutions, including the US Department of Energy’s Water Power Technologies Office, the U.S. Economic Development Agency, Orsted, the Massachusetts Clean Energy Center, the Massachusetts Tech Collaborative, Cambridge Innovation Center, Giant Shoulders and Goodwin Proctor.

BlueSwell recently received an Honorable Mention in the Corporate Social Responsibility and Experimental categories for Fast Company’s 2021 World Changing Ideas Awards. SeaAhead and the New England Aquarium have raised over $1.8 million to support BlueSwell’s growth.

LOS ANGELES (January 22, 2024) — Today, Captura announced it expanded its Series A funding round to raise an additional US$21.5 million to commercialize its Direct Ocean Capture (DOC) technology that harnesses the power of the ocean to absorb carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from the atmosphere.

Maersk Growth, Eni Next, and EDP Ventures came aboard as new investors in the round, bringing expertise across shipping and logistics, energy, and utilities to Captura’s team. Many of Captura’s existing backers also re-invested, including Future Planet Capital who led the expanded round, Equinor Ventures, Freeflow Ventures, Hitachi Ventures, Aramco Ventures, mTerra Ventures, and EIC Rose Rock Venture Fund.

Captura raised an initial US$12M in January 2023 and increased its Series A financing to reflect growing momentum as the company progresses its technology pilot program and begins design work for commercial plants. Captura has two operational pilot plants in California and is developing its third in partnership with Equinor. This plant has a capture capacity of 1000 tons of CO 2 annually and is planned to be installed in Norway in Fall, 2024. Following this pilot, Captura plans to move into large-scale commercial deployments with early plants capturing tens of thousands of tons of CO 2 or more annually.

These plants will use Captura’s unique DOC technology that captures CO 2 from the ocean so it can be permanently stored or turned into lower GHG emission fuel or other products. Removing CO 2 from the ocean using DOC amplifies the ocean’s natural capability as a carbon sink, creating capacity for an additional drawdown of CO 2 from the atmosphere.

The result of the process is removal of atmospheric CO 2 via the ocean, without adding anything to the ocean. With CO 2 roughly 150 times more concentrated volumetrically in the ocean compared to air, this provides an inherently scalable and efficient way to remove excess atmospheric CO 2 .

Maersk has a 2040 target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions and aims to transport a minimum of 25% of ocean cargo using green fuels by 2030. As part of these ambitious targets, Maersk Growth has committed to invest in and partner with a variety of green fuel and greenhouse gas reduction solutions.

“Maersk Growth is actively looking for promising startups in the Energy Transition space who can enable and accelerate the journey towards net-zero shipping and logistics,” says Ida Christine Brun, Head of External Innovation and Ecosystem Engagement at Maersk Growth. “Captura has developed a promising technology, and we are looking forward to joining forces with them.”

Eni Next, the corporate venture capital arm of Eni, invests in high-growth start-ups with the most innovative, disruptive and scalable technologies to accelerate the energy transition toward a zero-carbon future.

“Eni Next is looking for new technological solutions leading towards energy transition and Captura represents an example of an innovative company we aim to support. We believe that the Direct Ocean Capture (DOC) technology has the potential to provide a meaningful contribution to reach net zero” said Clara Andreoletti, President and CEO of Eni Next.

EDP have stated a commitment to have 100% renewables generation by 2030 and Net Zero emissions by 2040. With a goal to support and stimulate the open innovation process in the energy sector, EDP Ventures – as the strategic venture arm of EDP Group – invests in early-stage tech startups with the potential to impact the lives of millions of people.

“A greener, safer, and more sustainable world begins with unwavering commitments from those dedicated to leading the energy transition. EDP has pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2040 and we are thrilled to collaborate with Captura in their mission to scale carbon removal. It’s becoming increasingly important to include carbon removal technologies as a part of a net-zero strategy, and Captura stands out as the leading player in this promising field. At EDP Ventures, we are delighted to contribute to this transformative journey,” said Luís Manuel, Executive Board Member of EDP Innovation and Managing Partner at EDP Ventures.

“This past year, Captura has made remarkable strides on our path to commercialization,” said Steve Oldham, CEO of Captura. “As we work to advance both our technology and business, we’re thrilled to welcome investment from industry-leading companies like Maersk, Eni Next, and EDP, and to have the continued support of our existing investors. With our growing network of deployment partners and investors, and the success of our technology pilot program, Captura is now well-positioned to bring our technology to market and deliver climate solutions at meaningful scale.”

Gateway Cargo Systems reaches 300% return on investment,https://www.itsmycargo.com/cases/gateway-cargo,N/A,"To address the challenge of email-based agent business, Gateway Cargo Systems adopted the external quote tool offered by ItsMyCargo.

While it took some time to get used to the new tool in 2019, the team adapted in a careful manner and started seeing the benefits of the automated rate quotation system right away.

""The agents took the system really well - but it was important that they really hear and see it from us personally so that the commitment would retain long-term, also for avoiding manual negotiations for good.""Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â

Christian Glitscher, CEO

The real usage came with in 2021 more freed up capacity on Gateway side to take the time to set up more agents. Since Â then, the growth has been relatively constant, so that in 2021 the av. quotation increase was ~40, while the av. quotation increase per month in 2022 was ~100.

Thanks to rate automation, we were able to cover in 2022

13.433 quotations

with ~that av. quote time at 6min = 1.343 hours saved

with av. salary for operator at â¬45.00, Â resulting in

â¬60.453 annual ROI, monthly at â¬5037,75

This equals a 300% ROI ratio

The past year speaks clear numbers, and with the Q1 2023 expansion, we have seen a constant climb, averaging a quote count increase is 99.25 quotes more per month, helping to achieve a company wide revenue increase (during COVID times) of 40% more.

This has brought numerous benefits to the organization, including increased efficiency, streamlined processes, and improved response times. The largest value add has been the opportunity gain: the team has gained tremendous time to spend more attention on the more complex, and new business deals.",cargo tech corporate venture

Credit agency ICRA forecasts increased spending on transportation infrastructure projects, including on roads, ports and airports over the coming years, benefiting from solid government support, rising capital outlays and a large pipeline of projects.

The government has planned a large capex under its ‘Maritime India Vision 2030’ to augment port capacity and infrastructure over the next decade.

This could bring about supply-demand mismatches in a few clusters, resulting in increased competition and pricing pressure for ports, said the report.

ICRA expects India’s government to maintain a strong focus on road sector investments through increasing capital outlays.

The Ministry of Roads, Transport and Highways’ (MoRTH) budgetary allocation for the sector has increased by more than 8 times over the past decade to Rs 2.7 lakh crore in fiscal 2025, reflecting a 22 per cent compound annual growth rate.

“India’s road construction will likely grow 5-8 per cent to 12,500 km-13,000 km in fiscal 2025, following a robust expansion of around 20 per cent in fiscal 2024. This pace of execution will be supported by a healthy pipeline of projects, increased government capital outlay and greater focus on project completion by MoRTH,” said Girishkumar Kadam, ICRA’s Senior Vice President and Group Head, Corporate Ratings.

According to the rating agency, investments in airport infrastructure will also remain healthy at around Rs 55,000 crore-Rs 60,000 crores of committed capex over the next 3-4 years channelled toward projects including new greenfield airports, brownfield development and airport expansions under the Airports Authority of India (AAI).

Overall passenger traffic at airports will likely grow at a healthy 8-11 per cent to around 407 million-418 million passengers in fiscal 2025 from fiscal 2024, the report said.",cargo tech corporate venture

The partnership will see nine countries added to Kerry Logistics’ global network. They include Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Ukraine.

Leveraging the booming trade between China and Europe, Kazakhstan, in particular, is expected to benefit most from the increasing transit cargo flow along the trade lanes.

“The new partnership will allow the two groups to leverage each other’s competitive strengths and provide new options and cost-efficient multimodal solutions to our customers with greater flexibility and access to the strongest network in Asia,” William Ma, Group Managing Director of Kerry Logistics, said.

“While we will continue to develop an overland transportation network for road, rail and multimodal freight services from China to Central Asia and Europe, we will also build upon our expertise in project logistics within our global network to exploit new business opportunities.”

The move came at the heels of Kerry Logistics’ launch of its rail freight operations between China and Europe.

This week, we’re diving into the world of regenerative Venture Capital (VC) which has an important role in finding, funding, and growing companies that create breakthrough solutions. For the last half-century, VC-funded businesses have been a source of transformative innovations, from the semiconductor to the smartphone, from gene sequencing to vaccines. It’s time we use them responsibly – for the future of the planet, and not for profit.

As is clear from the latest IPCC report (read our thoughts on it here), the world must speed up progress on tackling climate change if it is to meet the Paris Agreement goals. Beating climate change will demand a wide variety of innovations. Cue: venture capital investments that can scale up existing technologies to help reduce emissions and help platform smaller ethical businesses to make them more visible to consumers.

Finance has been increasingly concerned about climate change – it poses an enormous threat to financial stability. We have seen the rise of climate/environmental risk management, which seeks for firms to disclose the potential impacts of climate change, and to take steps to guard against it.

Finance companies, however, are still channelling massive amounts of funds toward the fossil fuel sector. In fact, as Hans Hoogervorst, the chairman of the International Accounting Standards Board himself put it: “We should not expect sustainability reporting to be very effective in inducing companies to prioritize planet over profit . . . Greenwashing is rampant.”

CSR (corporate social responsibility) has been replaced with ESG (environmental, social, and governance) numbers that include data on emissions, labour practices, diversity, board independence, and supply chain information. We’ve covered the limitations of ESGs in detail but in a nutshell: What gets measured doesn’t necessarily get managed. There are several problems with reporting that are yet to be sorted out.

What, then, is the immediate goal for Venture Capital? To accelerate the just transition and align with research, legislators and people-led movements. Bold, large-scale, people-centred movements will hold capitalists accountable. Academia will pursue discovery research. Legislators and regulators will need to move away from lobbying with fossil fuel companies. And entrepreneurs will commercialize and scale solutions to more sustainable options. Keeping this in mind, we’ve curated a list of our ten favourite impact funds…

Sustainable agriculture is one that depletes neither the people nor the land. Freshly launched in 2021, Fresh Ventures is a venture building program and startup studio based in The Netherlands. They build new companies with experienced professionals and entrepreneurs to address systemic challenges in the food system.

If you’re motivated to transform the food system and looking for ways to put your talent and time to work, consider joining the next cohort, alone or in a team, and building solutions with a systemic impact. Learn more about their previous cohort’s regenerative adventures here.

Time for the Planet is a non-profit movement we supported through our latest Conscious Festival and we are a big fan. It’s a company that creates and finances companies that fight global climate change. Their mission? To fundraise 1 billion euros to create 100 companies fighting against global warming. They’ve identified 20 areas that companies can act on to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; among them: increasing the lifespan of goods, constructing sustainable buildings, regenerating agricultural land, and more. With these 20 areas, they’re hoping to create 100 companies that can use entrepreneurship to save the planet.

They recently selected the first innovations they are financially backing up through donations they received. One of their innovations, Beyond The Sea, relies on kites to push sea cargo (which would be the 6th biggest polluter if it were a country). Time for the Planet is unique because not only are they looking for companies and innovators to come on board, they’ve come up with ways that everyday people can help too. On their website, you’ll find ways that you can help.

Climate Change mitigation is a race against time. FullCycle built an acceleration ecosystem to scale commercially ready technology solutions to the climate crisis. FullCycle invests to accelerate the deployment of technologies that address the greenhouse gases with the highest warming potential in the first 20 years of emission (GWP20). These high-impact climate pollutants (CH4, HFC, N2O, etc) make up 24% of atmospheric greenhouse gases while being responsible for close to 50% of global warming.

FullCycle developed a unique investment model, specifically designed to accelerate the deployment of climate critical technologies. These technologies must exceed their threshold for Carbon Return on Investment (CROI-20) and deliver above-market returns on a risk-adjusted basis.

This Leonardo Di Caprio-backed venture capital has big ambitions for funding retail-focused climate innovation (they’re even investing in PANGAIA). It is an early-stage venture fund supercharging consumer-powered climate innovation driven by circular and regenerative principles.

The fund’s goal is to reimagine what we buy: from what materials go into the products, to the services using those materials, to the technology that could keep those materials in circulation. They decide on what to invest in based on a project’s “circular regenerative potential” across five themes: their resource footprint, greenhouse gas emissions, material waste, toxicity and human impact. Currently, the investment strategy encompasses design (materials and packaging), use (consumer brands and products), and reuse technologies (reverse logistics and marketplaces) that generate measurable environmental impact.

By 2050, 73% of global carbon emissions will come from emerging market’s megacities. The fact is, the solutions are already here. Yet, due to lack of funding and support, they are almost never deployed. Atlas Society, based in Vancouver, Paris and Singapore, is the citizen movement that identifies, finances and deploys these innovations on a large scale. They’re doing the beautiful and critical work of backing tech entrepreneurs who are reimagining and adapting the next climate-resilient cities. They’re doing this by building businesses that are reinventing how our cities are fed, constructed and powered, for good.

Led and backed by serious Fortunes 500 and technology players, the team combines institutional strength and entrepreneurial spirit. They call this the Adaptive Economy, a mission that includes sustainable materials in fashion (contributing to 9% of CO2 in the world), the capture of CO2 in factory chimneys (6% of CO2 in the world), cement-free construction (8% of world’s CO2) and storage of renewable energy output (22% of the world’s CO2!). Join Atlas, this movement is yours.

A Paris- and New York-based early-stage investment fund, Eutopia invests in consumer startups with a purpose who are rethinking the way we eat, sleep, dress, exercise and feel (the broad categories are: Wellness & beauty, Food & beverage, Recreation, Fashion & accessories.) They empower early-stage startups to grow through investment, in-house expertise and a network of global advisors.

Eutopia incorporates environmental, social and corporate governance issues into the investment practice, has signed the UN’s PRI — the world’s leading standard for responsible investment — and is a member of the International Climate Initiative to strengthen commitment. Moreover: Eutopia has committed to donating 1% of capital gains generated by the fund to make.org other philanthropic projects. The startups that they back have a strong brand potential, a proven scalable business model and a “better for me, better for the communities, better for the planet” approach. We love to see it!

Methane, the main ingredient in natural gas, is a greenhouse gas, trapping about 80 times more heat than CO2 over a 20 year period. Inger Anderson, the UN’s Environmental Program Executive Director, recently said, “Cutting methane is the strongest lever we have to slow climate change over the next 25 years”. The good news is that methane persists for a short time in the atmosphere, so curtailing methane emissions has an immediate impact.

The best immediate way to cut methane would be to capture leakage from trillions of dollars of natural gas operations, one of the largest sources of methane pollution. Kairos Aerospace, a VC company, is solving the problem of methane leakage by pioneering an accurate aerial monitoring service that provides actionable data on methane leaks from industrial and energy infrastructure. Since it was founded in 2014, Kairos has prevented 14.4 billion cubic feet of methane emissions from being released into the atmosphere, equivalent to removing 1.6 million vehicles from the road!

Another obvious way to cut emissions is to make the zero-carbon electricity generation we already have much cheaper. Oklo, another VC company, is building a compact fast nuclear reactor to be fueled initially by existing nuclear waste, a configuration that has already been largely validated by US regulators (with final approval expected very soon). Because Oklo’s micro-reactors could cost around $10 million to build and only $3 million a year to run (compared to the tens of billions now required to construct and maintain the electric grid), they could be used in developing countries or parts of the world now unconnected to the energy grid.

Oklo will also generate energy with larger reactors and by stringing together a series of its reactors. Oklo’s reactors would raise global standards of living by providing economies with abundant clean energy, and power technologies to ameliorate climate change, from conventional indoor air conditioning to large-scale atmospheric CO2 removal.

Based in London and San Francisco, The Craftory is a global investment house that focuses exclusively on brands that positively impact society and the planet. They’re obsessed with Consumer Packaged Goods and Fast Moving Consumer Goods that raise the bar on sustainability, democratising access for all, fairer supply chains, inclusivity, or offer healthier alternatives than the status quo.

Arajet welcomes 10th Boeing 737 MAX to its fleet,https://avitrader.com/2024/06/13/arajet-welcomes-10th-boeing-737-max-to-its-fleet/,5 часов назад,"Arajet's 10th Boeing 737 MAX arrived in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic on June 11, as the airline continues to expand its fuel-efficient fleet. This 737-8 delivery, facilitated through a lessor, supports Arajet's growth strategy across the Americas, with plans to more than double its routes in the coming years.

“This tenth aircraft is unique, not only because it has a special Dominican ribbon painted on the fuselage, but because it will increase the number of connections we make with the continent. We are reaffirming our commitment to democratise the skies and be able to connect all our countries with the lowest possible prices,” said Victor Pacheco Méndez, CEO and founder of Arajet. Since launching in 2022, Arajet has expanded its all-737 MAX fleet to serve 23 destinations in 16 countries, including Canada, Mexico, and Argentina. Arajet's performance earned it recognition as the ‘start-up airline of the year' at the World Aviation Summit in 2023.

With 737-8 jets capable of flying up to 3,500 nautical miles, the airline operates some of the longest routes in the region, efficiently connecting the Caribbean to North and South America.

Powered by CFM International LEAP-1B engines and advanced technology winglets, the 737 MAX reduces fuel use and emissions by 20% compared to the aeroplanes it replaces. It can fly farther than previous generation aeroplanes and has a 50% smaller noise footprint.",cargo tech corporate venture
Scheduling vehicles in automated transportation systems,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-26686-0_11,Автор: M van der Heijden,"One of the major planning issues in large scale automated transportation systems is so-called empty vehicle management, the timely supply of vehicles to terminals in order to reduce cargo waiting times. Motivated by a Dutch pilot project on an underground cargo transportation system using Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs), we developed several rules and algorithms for empty vehicle management, varying from trivial First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) via look-ahead rules to integral planning. For our application, we focus on attaining customer service levels in the presence of varying order priorities, taking into account resource capacities and the relation to other planning decisions, such as terminal management. We show how the various rules are embedded in a framework for logistics control of automated transportation networks. Using simulation, the planning options are evaluated on their performance in terms of customer service levels, AGV requirements and empty travel distances. Based on our experiments, we conclude that look-ahead rules have significant advantages above FCFS. A more advanced so-called serial scheduling method outperforms the look-ahead rules if the peak demand quickly moves amongst routes in the system.",fleet management technology pilot project
Electrified fleets for lower emissions,https://annualreport.greenmunicipalfund.ca/electrified-fleets-lower-emissions,N/A,"BC Capital Regional District Zero Emission Fleet Initiative

BC’s Capital Regional District (CRD) continued its corporate fleet electrification pilot project last year with GMF support, exploring the carbon-reducing possibilities of fleet telematics and fuel cell technology. The CRD is a regional government responsible for 13 municipalities and three electoral areas on southern Vancouver Island and the nearby Gulf Islands. As part of this ambitious project, it is replacing eight gas engine vehicles with six fuel cell electric vehicles and two battery electric vehicles. The CRD is also installing telematics devices in another 40 vehicles to generate data that will enable more efficient route planning and optimize overall fleet management.

If the results of the project are positive, the CRD will replace up to 100 gas engine vehicles with zero emissions alternatives as part of its longer-term fleet renewal, potentially reducing its operational GHG emissions by 440 tonnes of CO2e/year — a 35% reduction of total fleet emissions. Other municipalities could leverage the CRD’s findings to make similar enhancements to their fleets.

While relatively new in Canada, fuel cell electric vehicles offer considerably greater range and faster refuelling than battery electric vehicle options. Telematics can help identify opportunities for zero-emission vehicle conversion and help minimize a fleet’s carbon footprint.",fleet management technology pilot project
Florida Connected Vehicle pilot and Siemens Mobility,https://teamfl.org/florida-connected-vehicle-pilot-and-siemens-mobility/,N/A,"Florida Connected Vehicle pilot and Siemens Mobility

Florida has been at the forefront of implementing innovative vehicle-to-infrastructure

technology, and Siemens Mobility has been working hand-in-hand with Florida in this effort,

implementing the infrastructure for the Tampa-Hillsborough Expressway Authority (THEA) and

their Connected Vehicle (CV) pilot.

Siemens has been supplying traffic-related products and services to FDOT, as well as local

municipalities in Florida for over 40 years. Most recently, as the primary CV technology partner

in the high-profile (THEA) USDOT Connected Vehicle Pilot Project, it has supplied over 40

Roadside Units (RSUs) helping to drive the development of more than a dozen Vehicle-toInfrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) applications.

The THEA USDOT CV pilot is proving to be one of the most successful pilots of its kind in the

country. It was launched in 2015 and is currently equipping buses, streetcars and hundreds of

privately-owned vehicles with CV technology that helps manage day-to-day commuting issues.

Siemens Mobility’s technology allows the vehicles to communicate with the infrastructure and

provide warnings or prioritize traffic signaling to manage against problems such as Backups,

Congestions, Wrong-way Driving as well as conflicts with public street transportation. There are

obvious benefits for pedestrian safety as well. Most recently, THEA reached a major milestone,

passing important interoperability tests, demonstrating that the equipment was able to work

successfully between other test sites – something never tested before at this scale.

Recognition has been widespread. Not only was the THEA USDOT CV pilot named “this year’s

(2019) Best Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) Award” from the Intelligent Transportation

Society of America, it was also inducted into the ITS World Congress Hall of Fame this year – an

honor saved for the most outstanding, ambitious and innovative ITS deployments in the world.

But the benefits of CV technology are not only being experienced around Tampa. Drivers in

Gainesville, and those who drive around the “Trapezium” that surrounds the University of

Florida campus, are also benefitting from a partnership with Siemens Mobility. Currently, it is

providing CV infrastructure equipment, onboard units, applications and central management

software for use along the 27 intersections surrounding the University of Florida –an

environment with a rich mix of automobile, transit, bicycle and pedestrian activity and currently

a real hotbed for leading technologies in connected and autonomous vehicle deployment.

Siemens’ history with CV applications in the USA extends back to 2007 with its involvement

with the USDOT Connected Vehicle Test Bed in Michigan. This was a testing environment

intended to advance the state of ITS practice by providing a cutting-edge model operating

environment for CV and DSRC. The company was one of the first controller manufacturers to

output SPaT data at the testbed. It is currently working with other cities, including New York,

Las Vegas, Anaheim, Columbus, Ann Arbor, Madison, Austin and Montreal to design and deploy

these types of intelligent systems.

As Marcus Welz, president of Siemens Mobility’s ITS business in North America, noted, “We are

excited to be leading the momentum for CV deployment in cities around the country. The

inevitable safety and mobility benefits provided by utilizing CV technology is becoming more

mainstream, thanks in large part to the efforts and political will we are seeing in Florida, which

is really turning into a spotlight for this disruptive new force in mobility.”",fleet management technology pilot project

Treasure Island Autonomous Shuttle Pilot,https://www.sfcta.org/projects/treasure-island-autonomous-shuttle-pilot,N/A,"Overview

The Treasure Island Mobility Management Agency piloted an autonomous shuttle service on Treasure Island to better understand how such a service could meet the needs of people traveling around the neighborhood and to provide the community with opportunities to learn about driverless technology. (An autonomous vehicle—also known as a self-driving vehicle, driver-less vehicle, or robotic vehicle—can drive itself with little or no human involvement. Learn more about autonomous vehicle technology.)

The fully electric autonomous shuttle - called the Loop - was among the first demonstrations of AV shuttles transporting members of the public on public roadways in California, and operated for four months along a fixed route on Treasure Island. The rides complement Muni’s 25-Treasure Island line, were free to the public, and had an attendant on the vehicle at all times.

Ongoing efforts were made to engage with the community to collect feedback on the pilot. The project team also worked to establish partnerships to support local workforce, labor, and businesses throughout the pilot period.

Port of Hamburg | Hamburg's green fleet,http://www.hafen-hamburg.de/en/port-of-hamburg-magazine/hafen-und-klima/hamburgs-gruene-flotte/,N/A,"Under the motto ‘Hamburg’s Green Fleet’, since 2017 Hamburg has combined all municipal craft under a single fleet management and has moreover set itself the target of becoming the top player for alternative, sustainable ship operation.

Hamburg’s municipal fleet – or Grüne Flotte Hamburg – comprises about 45 craft. Thanks to this consolidated management, not only can maintenance, repair and acquisition be standardized, but any chartering can be cost-efficient. Newbuildings, rebuildings and maintenance are self-financing. Given an environmental strategy aiming for clean, green shipping, one especially relevant element of fleet management here is fleet modernization.

Accounting for less than one percent of atmospheric pollutant emissions in Hamburg, the fleet’s direct impact may be small, yet it can function significantly as a pioneer of change.

As one of Hamburg Port Authority’s subsidiaries with 150 staff, the fleet not only offers the essential nautical experience, but is an independent candidate for innovative investments with no public subsidy involved.

Combining all municipal craft as one entity makes a uniform environmental strategy feasible for the first time. This embraces five fields of action, or five pillars forming the basis for fleet management that will make shipping here modern and fit for the future,

namely: Low-emission fuels, exhaust after-treatment systems for new vessels, retrofit solutions, innovative propulsion technologies and energy-efficient ship operation.

Sustainable retrofits or newbuildings

Converting and modernizing existing craft sustainably can already reduce emissions of nitrogen particles and nitrogen oxide by over 90 percent. Fitting systems for subsequent exhaust gas treatment or even installing hybrid propulsion can form a substantial part of a green environment strategy.

Costing about 150,000 euros per ship, these measures are not inexpensive. Depending on ship type, however, engine-room size is a more serious challenge. Re-equipment measures often prove irrelevant, however, with the engine-room simply not offering sufficient space for new motors or exhaust treatment filters.",fleet management technology pilot project
Pilot project purgatory? Assessing automated vehicle ...,https://ideas.repec.org/a/pal/palcom/v8y2021i1d10.1057_s41599-021-01006-2.html,Автор: D McAslan,"Pilot projects have emerged in cities globally as a way to experiment with the utilization of a suite of smart mobility and emerging transportation technologies. Automated vehicles (AVs) have become central tools for such projects as city governments and industry explore the use and impact of this emerging technology. This paper presents a large-scale assessment of AV pilot projects in U.S. cities to understand how pilot projects are being used to examine the risks and benefits of AVs, how cities integrate these potentially transformative technologies into conventional policy and planning, and how and what they are learning about this technology and its future opportunities and risks. Through interviews with planning practitioners and document analysis, we demonstrate that the approaches cities take for AVs differ significantly, and often lack coherent policy goals. Key findings from this research include: (1) a disconnect between the goals of the pilot projects and a city’s transportation goals; (2) cities generally lack a long-term vision for how AVs fit into future mobility systems and how they might help address transportation goals; (3) an overemphasis of non-transportation benefits of AV pilots projects; (4) AV pilot projects exhibit a lack of policy learning and iteration; and (5) cities are not leveraging pilot projects for public benefits. Overall, urban and transportation planners and decision makers show a clear interest to discover how AVs can be used to address transportation challenges in their communities, but our research shows that while AV pilot projects purport to do this, while having numerous outcomes, they have limited value for informing transportation policy and planning questions around AVs. We also find that AV pilot projects, as presently structured, may constrain planners’ ability to re-think transportation systems within the context of rapid technological change.

ST and rideOS team on Singapore autonomous project,https://disruptivetechnews.com/big_news/st-and-rideos-team-on-singapore-autonomous-project/,N/A,"ST Engineering and rideOS, are to team on a pilot project to accelerate the deployment of integrated autonomous transport systems in Singapore.

The partners will each contribute products to the collaborative framework such as constraint-based routing and self-driving bus technology to create a Next Generation Traffic Control System for autonomous vehicles.

The framework will, in time, include solutions from other partners who are committed to deploying self-driving vehicles at scale. The objective is to deliver an on-demand mobility system for safely managing a city’s transportation services end-to-end.

The system will cover areas such as fleet management cloud services, vehicle technology, and both technological and physical infrastructure, to enable the operation of on-demand fleets of human-operated and self-driving transport services.

ST Engineering will provide its cyber security, platform-agnostic AV kit, Autonomous Vehicle Management System and Smart City traffic infrastructure necessary for autonomous platforms in urbanised, mixed traffic environments.

“We embrace industry collaborations and this partnership with rideOS will be the catalyst and bring together the different components necessary for an efficient autonomous transportation system in Singapore,” said ST Engineering’s Land Systems sector president, Lee Shiang Long.

“The combination of our expertise in this global collaborative framework means we are closer than ever to completing the full AV stack and realising a driverless world.”

The partnership will address a gap in the current industry landscape where most current development efforts for self-driving vehicles are focused on the sensor hardware and onboard software that enable autonomy.

To roll out self-driving transportation at scale, fleet management platforms and smart city infrastructure are equally critical and would require relevant organisations from around the world to work together to build a comprehensive transportation system solution.

For the first collaborative project, rideOS will power ST Engineering’s autonomous bus pilot with a set of software products and services including real-time autonomous vehicle routing, estimated time of arrival (ETA) calculations, dispatch services, supply positioning, multi-rider trip planning and fleet management dashboards.

“The underlying technology for self-driving vehicles and the infrastructure needed to support the safe, global roll-out of self-driving fleets is incredibly complex,” said rideOS CEO and co-founder, Justin Ho.

“In addition to key technologies from ST Engineering, the global collaborative framework includes our mapping and marketplace services powered by a real-time data platform, as well as a fleet management dashboard.

“However, in order to create a full-stack system, the framework must partner with numerous governments, technology providers, and OEMs.”",fleet management technology pilot project
Platooning transit vehicle pilot study for PennDOT,https://digital.aecom.com/project/pennsylvania-platooning-transit-vehicle-pilot-study/,N/A,"One of the tasks we led was to conduct a connected vehicle (CV) and automated vehicle (AV) roadway readiness analysis (RRA) and technology feasibility study for a variety of roadways in Western Pennsylvania including arterials, city roads, and interstate highways to connect populated towns to Pittsburgh. The use case is to deploy automated full-size buses, which travel together in a platoon with minimal headway separation, behaving as two parts of a single vehicle. The first stage would deploy automation consistent with Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) Level 2, with a follower vehicle able to maintain a specific following distance behind a lead bus, and to steer automatically based on the direction of motion of the lead bus. The second stage would deploy buses with SAE Level 4 automation, which also include the SAE Cooperative Driving Automation (CDA) functionality, enabling the lead and follower buses to coordinate their movements without human operator intervention.

We are applying the RRA framework, processes and tools to assess the readiness of the roadways for deployment of this technology while remaining technology agnostic. The RRA also includes the AECOM-developed roadway complexity for automated vehicles (RCAV) analysis, which quantifies the level of difficulty of a roadway for todayâs automated driving systems (ADS), which can highlight segments of a road that may provide barriers for deployment.

The RRA may also be used for identifying CV and AV applications, exploring data exchange and open data needs, and for communication with the public and other stakeholders as to the readiness of a roadway system to support CV and AV applications.

Meet the founders - Altilium Magna,https://spacehubs.network/news-section-5-2/,N/A,"Meet the founders – Altilium Magna

We talked with Christopher P. Ley, CEO of Altilium Magna, to know more about his solution and the challenges of building a startup in the space industry.

1- Can you briefly explain what your solution is all about? What’s unique about it?

We empower our clients with highly accurate Battery Management Analytics that can accurately estimate and predict critical states of Lithium-Ion batteries. We have developed a unique adaptive battery model that learns the ever-changing internal characteristics of the battery system so that it can accurately predict the autonomy (e.g. range) of a system that relies on batteries to operate e.g. Satellites, e-Aircraft, e-Vehicles. It does this by learning online how the battery system is degrading over time from operational data alone and can provide a wealth of (precise) insights into the battery system for operations like range predictions, fleet management and life cycle management. Our technology is non-invasive and requires no calibration nor deviation from the operation and is best-in-class, backed by a decade of published research and laboratory testing.

2- What’s the story behind your company? How was the idea for this business born?

Altilium Magna’s core technology is the result of the commercialisation of our founder, Dr. Christopher Ley’s PhD thesis and over 10 years of research & development and commercial experience. The commercialisation was born from this state of the art research as well as the realisation that commercially battery management technology is almost a decade behind the best in class analytics and in order for there to be a rapid shift to the adequate utilisation of battery systems in vehicles etc. there needs to be a rapid leap in technology. Altilium Magna intends to do just that.

3-Which is the challenge that your solution tackles, and how do you set apart from the other companies with similar solutions?

We have developed a unique adaptive battery model that learns the ever-changing internal characteristics of the battery system so that it can accurately predict the autonomy (e.g. range) of a system that relies on batteries to operate e.g. Satellites, e-Aircraft, e-Vehicles. It does this by learning online how the battery system is degrading over time from operational data alone and can provide a wealth of (precise) insights into the battery system for operations like range predictions, fleet management and life cycle management. Our technology is non-invasive and requires no calibration nor deviation from the operation and is best-in-class, backed by a decade of published research and laboratory testing.

4- What are your goals, and what’s the biggest challenge you are trying to overcome at this moment?

We are attempting to establish a pilot project in order to demonstrate the superiority of our technology in order to gain traction. Practically all companies in this space are gigantic (e.g. Boeing) so initiating a B2B relationship as a start-up is hard, coupled with the fact that no one wants to be first in shifting to a new commercially unproven technology (apart from the laboratory).

5- What advice would you give to an entrepreneur trying to pave his/her way in the space sector landscape?

Try to foster as many contacts as you can in the sector, relationships can pan out in interesting ways.

6- About SUN, why did you apply?

To foster relationships in the space industry, hopefully with the ultimate end of beginning a pilot project.",fleet management technology pilot project

Vehicle-to-Building EV Pilot | City of Boulder,https://bouldercolorado.gov/projects/vehicle-building-ev-pilot,N/A,"Project Overview

Typically, electric vehicle (EV) chargers provide energy in one direction: from the energy grid or building to the car.

In this new project, the city and Fermata Energy have installed a charging station that enables two-way electricity: from the building to the car and from the car back to the building.

This technology, called vehicle-to-building (V2B), can provide the city new ways to manage its energy load, and reduce energy costs.

Fermata Energy’s bidirectional charging system for EVs allows vehicle batteries to transfer energy from the battery back to the North Boulder Recreation Center in order to support the building’s electric loads and to reduce peak demand.",fleet management technology pilot project
SWTCH launches an innovative V2G & E-Mobility pilot,https://swtchenergy.com/swtch-launches-an-innovative-v2g-e-mobility-pilot/,N/A,"With more and more buyers opting for electric vehicles over conventional internal combustion the strain on our power grids is set to increase. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging is an innovative way of managing this increased demand. After all, an electric car is essentially an enormous battery on wheels, so why not use that battery’s storage capacity to send power to the building the vehicle’s plugged in at, or back to the grid, during peak demand periods when the car would otherwise be parked?

Toronto’s SWTCH Energy is exploring exactly this possibility with a new two-year pilot project at Tridel’s Bianca Condos in midtown Toronto. SWTCH, an end-to-end EV charging and energy management solution provider, is partnering with Tridel, Ontario’s Electrical System Operator (IESO) and Kite Mobility to determine the economic feasibility of V2G energy flow.

The project uses one of Kite’s Nissan Leaf electric vehicles as the Leaf is the most common EV capable of bi-directional charging on North American roads. Condo residents can book the car for their own use, while SWTCH and Kite can control availability to ensure it’s plugged into its 30 kW charger during peak demand hours. SWTCH will then have the vehicle discharge power back into the building, lessening the amount it has to draw from the grid and reducing its energy consumption at the same time. This is where vehicle sharing programs are especially valuable, as they can guarantee where the cars will be when they’re needed for power.

Owner incentives are key to driving adoption

The icing on the proverbial cake comes with the inclusion of one of SWTCH’s previous projects in the V2G pilot program: paying vehicle owners for the energy drawn from their electric vehicles. This financial incentive tracks the energy that goes in and out of a car’s battery and “creates a history of credits and debits” through a blockchain-based wallet that owners can monitor on their phones.

Speaking with CleanTechnica, SWTCH CEO Carter Li had this to say:

“Leveraging SWTCH’s bidirectional, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging technology, our pilot will explore viability of vehicle-to-grid charging technology in high-density multi-tenant buildings to store energy using EVs during off-peak hours and redistribute that energy to the building and other uni-directional EV chargers during on-peak hours. The technology and model developed by SWTCH is unique as it includes a financial incentive structure for EV owners to participate in the program which leverages blockchain technology. The SWTCH platform tracks when energy is being discharged from an EVs battery and when it’s being charged, creating a history of credits and debits securely managed through a third-party distributed ledger system that participants can monitor using their smartphones.”

In this pilot project, SWTCH aims to reduce daily peak energy consumption by up to 25% and lower average EV charging costs by as much as 50% thanks to its blockchain-monitored wallet system. If the results at Bianca Condos are encouraging the sky is really the limit. SWTCH has already has partners in engineering and planning firm IBI Group as well as Slate Asset Management which would allow the Toronto energy solutions company to install its innovative V2G systems in high-density buildings all over North America. SWTCH is also part of the Smart City Sandbox Initiative which works towards the development of highly connected smart cities where V2G technology will be essential.

Innovative electric vehicle charging project launches in ...,https://www.mynottinghamnews.co.uk/innovative-electric-vehicle-charging-project-launches-in-nottingham/,N/A,"A UK-first vehicle-to-grid (V2G) demonstrator project has launched this week. Installation of solar panels, battery storage and 40 bi-directional electric vehicle charging units mark the completion of the CleanMobilEnergy pilot at Nottingham City Council’s Eastcroft Depot.

Funded by Interreg North-West Europe (an EU funded programme), with a contribution from Innovate UK (part of the UK Government’s Research and Innovation agency), the V2G pilot will show how technology can be used to improve energy demands caused by changing fleet from traditional internal combustion engines to electric vehicles (EV).

This pilot aims to maximise the use of renewable energy that is generated locally by using the batteries and the 40 V2G vehicles for short-term storage of the electricity generated by the solar panels at the depot. Monitored by a purpose-built Energy Management System, the bi-directional charging units can send power back to the buildings on the depot or to the grid during peak times, balancing the demand of electricity and reducing energy costs.

Cllr Sally Longford, Portfolio Holder for Energy, Environment and Waste Services, said: “We are racing towards becoming the first carbon neutral city in the UK by 2028. Switching our fleet to electric vehicles allows us to reduce our carbon emissions, but it brings challenges around our energy supply to charge these vehicles. The vehicle-to-grid pilot is allowing us to explore innovative ways to bring renewable technologies, energy storage and intelligent management systems together to test solutions which could be rolled out in other areas of the country.”

Across the depot, solar arrays with a combined generation of 176kWp will allow Nottingham City Council to use clean energy to charge the growing electric vehicle fleet. 51% of the council’s vehicles are powered by electricity, including six bin lorries, road sweepers and vans.

Each of the giant batteries that have been installed for the project is made from 24 used EV batteries. These batteries are no longer sufficient for car journeys, but they have plenty of life left in them for energy storage. The giant batteries have a combined storage of 600kWh, which is enough to power the average UK household for two months.

“Becoming a carbon neutral city needs a huge step change, and we will need to explore innovative technologies to help us reach our ambitious target. It’s fantastic that we’ve been able to find solutions to charging electric vehicles which are sustainable by using renewable energy and recycled batteries,” says Cllr Longford.

Nottingham City Council has built a reputation for innovative low-carbon projects, having recently completed a trial for wireless electric taxi charging and being the first city in the UK to use the Energiesprong whole-house retrofit approach.

Wayne Bexton, Director of Environment and Sustainability, said: “The installation of the batteries concludes the infrastructure side of a remarkable project that enables energy from solar panels to be stored and sold back into the grid at the most lucrative times of day. As a demonstrator microgrid, it means we are less reliant on energy from the national grid to power our electric vehicles, helping us save money, save carbon and work towards carbon neutrality. I am extremely proud of the team working on this and thankful to our funders Interreg NW Europe and Innovate UK.”

Project Scope,https://cvp.nyc/project-scope,N/A,"NYC is one of three Connected Vehicle (CV) pilot deployment sites selected by USDOT to demonstrate the benefits of this new Connected Vehicle technology. The other sites are in Wyoming, which focuses on interstate routes and commercial vehicles, and Tampa, which will be testing a number of applications in a mid-sized urban environment on a relatively small number of vehicles.

The CV technology is a new tool to help NYC reach its Vision Zero goals to eliminate traffic related deaths and reduce crash related injuries and damage to both the vehicles and infrastructure. The NYC deployment is primarily focused on safety applications – which rely on vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and infrastructure-to-pedestrian (IVP) communications. These applications provide drivers with alerts so that the driver can take action to avoid a crash or reduce the severity of injuries or damage to vehicles and infrastructure.

The goal of this project is to show that the benefits justify the sustainability of the operation and will encourage others to outfit their vehicles thus increasing the benefits to all. In fact, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration (NHTSA) has begun a rulemaking process that will require this technology on all new vehicles sold in the US. A large US automobile manufacturer has already announced its intention to include this technology in some of its new models in 2017.

The project is divided into three phases. The first phase, completed in August 2016, was the planning phase. It included a concept of operations, system requirements, safety plan, benefits evaluation plan, security management plan, and deployment plan. The 2nd phase (52 months) began in September 2016 and includes the detailed design, field equipment development and procurement, software development, integration and the installation of the in-vehicle devices and the roadside infrastructure. The 3rd phase is a 12-month operating period during which the applications will be active and providing alerts to the drivers.

As part of this project, the City plans to install the CV technology in approximately 3,000 City vehicles which frequent the streets of Manhattan. These fleet vehicles represent about one million miles of vehicle travel per day!

The NYC Pilot Project will provide an opportunity to experience a density of vehicle interactions never previously attempted with Connected Vehicle technology!

Approximately 450 road side units (RSU) will be installed in Manhattan, along Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, and at other strategic locations such as bus depots, fleet vehicle storage facilities, river crossings and airports.

RSUs will also be installed along portions of FDR Drive to support applications such as curve speed warning and over dimension vehicle warnings (over height and prohibited commercial vehicles).

CV technology uses GPS location information which is augmented by other means to improve its accuracy. Each vehicle determines its position and time from the GPS signal. The vehicle then broadcasts (at approximately 10 times per second) its current position, where it has been (path history for the last few seconds), and its current heading to all nearby vehicles. At the same time, each vehicle processes the messages it hears from the other nearby vehicles and identifies potential hazardous situations. Then, based on the crash potential, it alerts the driver of the possible crash so that the driver can take appropriate action. In a similar fashion, the vehicles receive information from the traffic controllers that is analyzed by the vehicles to alert the driver of an impending red light violation in order to reduce the crashes at intersections.

The City is also working with a number of pedestrian advocacy groups and will be deploying two pedestrian-oriented applications. The 1st supports the visually challenged by using the geometric information about the intersection and the signal timing information transmitted by the intersection to assist the pedestrian in crossing the street. The 2nd is traditional pedestrian detection technology which will be able to determine if there is a potential conflict between an approaching CV equipped vehicle and the presence of a pedestrian in the crosswalk.

Finally, the City’s deployment will include a configurable data collection application that will be used to evaluate the benefits of the system and allow USDOT to perform additional evaluations of the overall system operation.

The high-tech express lane is still open to all users except semi trucks for the immediate future, but it will also serve as a testing ground for the technology during off-peak hours, MDOT officials said.

The pilot project involved placing the dividers separating the express lane traffic, installing improved pavement markings and guardrails, completing a high-friction surface treatment and positioning new lighting, officials said. The poles erected in the median are outfitted with cameras, radar sensors and wireless radio equipment meant to communicate with technology-enabled vehicles.

The express lane isn’t expected to create more congestion during morning and evening rush hours, or affect traffic, and there is no charge to drivers using the lane, MDOT officials said.

The state is also now conducting an environmental assessment for a larger, 40-mile project that envisions repurposing one travel lane in each direction on the interstate with equipment meant to interact with autonomous vehicles and smart technology, an effort first unveiled in 2020.

The corridor, when complete, would eventually stretch from Ann Arbor-Saline Road in Ann Arbor to M-10, the Lodge Freeway, in Detroit, officials said.

A map on the Michigan Department of Transportation's website shows the proposed phasing of a new I-94 express lane with technology for connected and automated vehicles between Ann Arbor and Detroit.Captured from MDOT website

The lanes will likely be physically separated from the rest of the highway, accessible only at certain points. At the start of the project, all vehicles will be able to use them, but as self-driving vehicles become more common and their usage exceeds a certain threshold, the lanes may be restricted to only the high-tech vehicles, according to a MDOT webpage detailing the project.

At this time, construction of the project is expected to be privately funded, according to MDOT. The initial segment is planned between U.S. 23 and Oakwood Boulevard, with the goal to begin construction after the environmental assessment process and final design is complete, officials say.

Ipswich Connected Vehicle Pilot - Research - QUT,https://research.qut.edu.au/icvp/,N/A,"Connected vehicle technologies enable vehicles to communicate with each other and with the infrastructure around them. Vehicles fitted with connected vehicle technologies will receive data from traffic signals and traffic management systems in relation to signal timings, speed limits, road works, and road hazards to receive relevant safety-related messages for drivers.

The Department of Transport and Main Roads, iMOVE Australia, and QUT’s Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety – Queensland (CARRS-Q) teamed up to test out this innovative technology on Queensland roads through the Ipswich Connected Vehicle Pilot (ICVP). The aim of the ICVP was to understand the improvements to road user safety that can be realised through connected vehicle technology. The project also examined the willingness of drivers to adopt and use such technology, and help prepare government and industry for the future roll-out of connected vehicle technologies.

The ICVP took place from mid-2020 until mid-2021. Around 350 participants had connected vehicle technology retrofitted in their vehicles. Results from the pilot are now available – please refer to the links below for the summary reports:

Our operating context and performance in F2021

Logistics Africa

Context

Prevailing weak economic conditions, high unemployment and low consumer spending were exacerbated by COVID-19 and continue to impact volumes and margins across many of our sectors, particularly in South Africa.

While a recovery across key sectors was recorded in the last quarter of F2021 particularly in commodities, fuel and gas, a third wave of COVID-19 infections in South Africa and restrictions on alcohol sales in the latter part of F2021 resulted in further weakening of the economy and the FMCG sector, which remains under pressure.

We anticipate trading activities in certain businesses in Logistics Africa to be impacted until COVID-19 infections reduce and restrictions ease.

There is also continued pressure in the South African market for growth as transport rates remain competitive due to competitors imposing margin cuts to win new or retain contracts.

During the year, we invested in additional capacity in consumer goods (FMCG) and healthcare clients as the pandemic drove heightened demand and consumption of related products.

We have made good progress on our strategic initiatives to deliver ‘One Imperial’ and ‘Gateway to Africa’, in a challenging environment where many of our markets continue to face uncertainty and volatility, driven by COVID-19 and resulting levels of lockdown and restrictions.

Logistics Africa recorded a recovery in volumes and profitability compared to the prior year, increasing revenue and operating profit by 2% and 31% respectively, despite the first half’s performance being significantly impacted by COVID-19 lockdown restrictions which resulted in the ban of alcohol and tobacco sales (c.12% of revenue).

Operating margin improved to 6.2% from 4.9% in F2020. Results were positively supported by solid contract renewal rates, contract gains and cost saving initiatives. Logistics Africa achieved full-year cost savings of c.R200 million (p.a.). The benefits of these cost savings will be fully realised from F2022 and will assist in maintaining our competitive market positioning.

New business revenue of approximately R2 billion (p.a.) was secured on a rolling 12-month basis to the end of June 2021. Logistics Africa’s contract renewal rate remains strong at c.79%.

Despite revenue growth, the lockdown restrictions resulted in a decline in volumes across most sectors – particularly in alcohol, tobacco and fuel.

The consolidated road freight businesses are benefitting from improved efficiencies. Revenue from the road freight business increased by 1%, supported by good volumes in the commodities businesses. Volumes were negatively impacted by the ban on alcohol sales and cross-border travel restrictions due to COVID-19 during the year. Operating profit increased by 21% supported by new business gains, improved fleet utilisation and efficient cost management.

Contract Logistics increased revenue and operating profit by 3% and 109% respectively due to new business gains despite volumes being negatively impacted by the ban of alcohol and tobacco sales due to COVID-19 lockdown restrictions.

Net capital expenditure from continuing operations (excluding IFRS 16) of R151 million was incurred during the period mainly due to the replacement cycle of fleet and investment in additional capacity for new contract gains. ROIC increased from 8.1% to 10.9% and is above our hurdle rate of WACC + 3%.

Logistics International

In February 2021, we announced that our Logistics International business was non-core to our ‘Gateway to Africa’ strategy and we would therefore be exploring an appropriate exit plan for this business. This business is, however, within the scope of the proposed offer from DP World.

Context

Despite the significant overhang of COVID-19, economic activity, growth forecasts and employment rates in Europe and the UK are steadily improving due to additional fiscal support in certain countries and swift progress in the roll-out of COVID-19 vaccines.

In Germany, some lockdown restrictions remain in place but gradually eased towards the latter part the 2021 financial year. However, the automotive sector continues to be negatively impacted by ongoing semi-conductor shortages.

In the UK, Brexit has resulted in slower imports and exports from the UK, and a shortage of drivers in the UK, negatively impacting our road freight businesses.

While our Logistics International business was the most impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in F2020, this business recorded significant improvement in trading activity on the back of the easing COVID-19 restrictions and economic recovery over the past 12 months. All businesses are currently operational and are demonstrating significantly improved performance. As a result, Logistics International achieved strong revenue and operating profit growth in Euros of 10% and in excess of 100% respectively, and, in Rand terms, revenue from Logistics International rose 17% while operating profit increased by over 100% compared to the previous year.

Results were supported by new contract gains, effective cost management and volume recovery in the key industries of operation as production ramped up. Logistics International’s contract renewal rate on existing contracts remains strong at c.87%, with an encouraging pipeline of new opportunities. New business revenue of approximately R2,2 billion was secured on a rolling 12-month basis to the end of June 2021.

Revenue generated from the freight business increased by 20% in Rands, supported by a good performance from our express palletised distribution business due to higher volumes in a COVID-19 environment, and a higher contribution from the air and ocean freight business. Operating profit increased by over 100% due to the growth in revenue supported by the improvement in operating margins.

Contract logistics increased revenue and operating profit in Rands by 12% and over 100% respectively as automotive production started to ramp-up again post COVID-19 lockdowns on the back of a recovery in vehicle sales. This, despite the automotive sector negatively impacted by the shortage of semi-conductors. Volumes in our chemicals-related businesses were less impacted by COVID-19 and further supported by new business gains.

The South American shipping business was disposed of in April 2021. During the year, it was significantly impacted by record low water levels which impacted both volumes and margins. More details are included in the ‘Disposals’ section of this report.

Net capital expenditure from continuing operations excluding businesses held for sale (excluding IFRS 16) of R193 million was incurred during the year mainly for replacement capex for transport fleet. ROIC improved to 5,7% but is lower than WACC.

Opening of new production and logistics site,https://www.wippermann.com/en/news/detail/opening-of-new-production-and-logistics-site,N/A,"In the presence of representatives of the Business Development Association and the municipal administration as well as 150 invited guests, the new production and logistics site of Wippermann jr. GmbH Trading was ceremoniously opened in Kirchlengern, Germany.

Managing directors Dr. Stephan Gerber and Christian Hamann as well as branch manager Roger Paul gave the guests an insight into the possibilities and advantages offered by the new location for the processing and packaging of high-quality industrial chains as well as new logistics capacities.

“Due to our consistent growth strategy, the capacities at the previous sites had been exhausted. From the outset, it was clear to us that we would not simply expand, but rather develop a new location that was optimally aligned to meet present and future demands, especially with regard to international markets,” explained Dr. Stephan Gerber regarding the decision to build a new facility. Production, warehouse, shipping and administration are interlinked in optimally coordinated processes on 2,800 square metres of production area. Dr. Gerber: “New machines and the optimized processes give us the chance to significantly extend production quantities and product versions in the future.

Branch Manager Roger Paul explained the significance of integrating the logistics work steps: “For our growing international business with high-quality industrial chains, we need highly efficient processes to serve our customers around the globe quickly and reliably.” From customs declaration through to secure transport packaging, all work steps are perfectly aligned at the new site. “And we have enough space for future expansions,” explained Roger Paul. “With an area of 11,000 square metres, the new site offers plenty of potential in case of need.

Abstract

In an increasingly disruptive global environment, marked by the potential development of the Post-New World Economic Order, more innovative, effective, and efficient logistics solutions are demanded. It is necessary to offer radical improvements in logistics services through new models. It is considered necessary to define the new concept of disruptive logistics based on three fundamental pillars: globalization, digitization, and sustainability. This chapter aims to address the new concept, more effective and efficient, in a highly turbulent environment that has become disruptive, with unpredictable, substantial, and impactful changes. The most significant geoeconomics aspects that would condition a hypothetical Post-New World Economic Order are analyzed, the main factors of the global sustainable logistics are studied, and the development of the concepts of Logistics 4.0 and Supply Chain Management 4.0 is reviewed. Finally, as a result, the main aspects of the proposed new concept are analyzed.",emerging logistics solutions
A case study of the Norwegian plastic pipe industry,https://ntnuopen.ntnu.no/ntnu-xmlui/handle/11250/3095597,Автор: HO Olsen,"Forskning som omhandler håndtering av plastavfall ved materialens sluttfase er vesentlig mindre utforsket enn andre alternativer for avfallshåndtering, og gjennomført forskning som omhandler bærekraftige logistikkløsninger omhandler hovedsakelig materialflyt til sluttkunde, og mangler fokus på materialflyten etter endt bruk. En tilnærming til avfallshåndtering som inkluderer materialflyt etter bruk er den sirkulære økonomien, hvor avfall reduseres til et minimum og livssyklusen til produktene utvides. I dag finnes det ingen omfattende rammeverk som støtter bedrifter i utviklingen av sirkulære forretningsmodeller, og det er mangel på diskusjon av temaet. Det er vesentlig å ta godt informerte beslutninger på hvordan man styrer materialflyten ved endt bruk, og disse manglene i forskningen skaper et behov for mer fokus på området.

Resirkuleringsprosessene for plastavfall i Norge avhenger av typen produkt og opphavet til avfallet go det er eksempelvis ulike prosesser for plastrør og emballasje. Resirkulering oppfattes generlet som den mest miljøvennlige praksisen, fordi det reduserer energibruk, reduserer utvinning av råmaterialer og bidrar til å motkjempe klimaendringer. Produsenter i den norske plastrørindustrien bruker minimalt med resirkulerte materialer i sin produksjon, noe som er nødt til å utvikles. Det overordnede målet for dette prosjektet var derfor å identifisere om det finnes potensiale for bedre utnyttelse av resirkulerte plastrør i produksjonen av nye rør. Objektivene med oppgaven var å identifisere returordninger i andre land og industries for å foreslå logistikkløsninger for den norske plastrørindustrien for å fasilitere en overgang til den sirkulære økonomien. Følgende forskningsspørsmål ble utviklet for å nå disse målene:

RQ1: Hvilke barrierer hindrer implementeringen av returordninger for å øke sirkulariteten i den norske plastrørindustrien?

RQ2: Finnes det potensiale for å øke sirkulariteten i den norske plastrørindustrien?

RQ3: Hvordan kan prosessen for gjenvinning av plastavfall i den norske plastrørindustrien utformes for å overkomme hindringene og utnytte potensialet for økt sirkularitet?

Metodikken som er brukt for å besvare forskningsspørsmålene består av literaturstudie, casestudie og spørreundersøkelser. Literaturstudien ble brukt for å få oversikt over forskningen på området, støtte opp under funnene i casestudien og spørreundersøkelsene, samt legge et bedre grunnlag for masteroppgaven. Casestudien ble brukt for å få kunnskap om casebedriften, den norske plastrørindustrien og løsninger i andre land. Spørreundersøkelsene ble brukt for å samle innsikt fra aktørene i plastrørindustrien. Funnene fra dette ble brukt for å utvikle de foreslåtte logistikkløsningene.

Dette avdekket at det er barrierer som hindrer implementeringen av en returordning i den norske plastrørindustrien. Disse barrierene er knyttet til karakteristikker ved bygningsprosjektene, strenge kvalitetskrav i industrien og lineære tankesett. Selv om det er barrierer tilstede, er det også potensiale for å implementere en slik løsning. Basert på svarene på spørreundersøkelsen er aktørene i industrien positive til en slik endring. De vurderer at det er mange fordeler med en slik ordning, men dette avhenger av de økonomiske faktorene. Dersom gode løsninger finnes for de økonomiske utfordringene med ordningen vil det være godt potensiale. Barrierene må motkjempes of lineære tankesett må endres. Det må være fokus på langsiktige effekter, samarbeid mellom interessenter og sirkulære forretningsmodeller.

Forslaget for en returordning i den norske plastrørindustrien omfatter fire kategorier: materialer og produkter som samles inn, alternativer for innsamling, kostnader og kostnadsfordeling og ansvarlige aktører. Rør produsert i alle tre materialene er inkludert i returordningen og det finnes fire alternativer for innsamling: containerleie, innsamlingpunkter, storsekker og innlevering til miljøstasjoner. Kostnadene for returordningen fordeles mellom aktørene, men det forventes at produsentene påtar seg mer av det økonomiske ansvaret for etabliringen av ordningen. Rørprodusente er også ansvarlige for etablering og administrasjon av ordning i samarbeid med industriorganisasjonen, imens de resterende aktøreene tar del i en organisasjon for returordningen. Disse forslagene er utviklet for å møte kravene fra aktørene i industrien, samtidig som det fasiliteter optimal materialflyt.

Målene for denne masteroppgaven vurderes som nådd og forskningsspørsmålene er besvart. For å konkludere finnes det barrierer som hindrer implementeringen av en returordning i den norske industrien. Dersom visse tilretteleggere er tilstede vil det allikevel være stort potensiale for vellykket implementering. Den foreslåtte returordningen er et godt sted å starte for den norske plastrørindustrien, men den er nødt til å videreutvikles.

De mest vesentlige begrensningene knyttet til denne oppgaven er at den hovedsakelig er basert på kvalitativ data og utfordringer med datainnsamlingen. Kvantitative vurderinger ville styrket troverdigheten av studien, og datagrunnlaget ville blitt styrket av bredere avgrensninger for spørreundersøkelsen sendt til aktører i den norske industrien. Det er også behov for videre arbeid, noe som er tredelt: funnene må kvantifiseres for å styrke den foreslåtte returordningen, de gjenværende kategoriene i forretningsmodellen må utvikles og ordningen må verifiseres med aktører i industrien.Research concerning the end-of-life (EOL) options for plastic waste is significantly less explored than other options, and the research in the area of sustainable logistics systems is predominantly focused on the forward flows in the supply chain without sufficient focus on the reverse flows. An approach to waste management strategies that incorporate the reverse flows is the circular economy, where waste is reduced to a minimum and the life cycle of the product is extended. There is no comprehensive framework supporting companies in designing a circular business model, and there is a lack of discussion on the topic. It is essential to make informed decisions on how to manage the reverse flows and these research gaps establishes a need for research in the area.

The process for recycling plastic waste in Norway depends on the type of product and the origin of the plastic waste, there are for instance different processes for plastic pipes and packaging. Recycling is generally perceived as an environmentally friendly practice, because it saves energy, reduces raw material extraction and combats climate change. Producers in the Norwegian plastic pipe industry use a minimal fraction of recycled materials in their production and there is therefore a need to develop optimal reverse flows. The goal of this project was to identify there is potential for utilizing recycled plastic pipes in the production of new pipes. The objectives were to identify take back schemes in other countries and industries to outline a logistics system for the Norwegian plastic pipe industry to enable a transition to a circular industry. The following research questions were developed to reach this objective:

RQ1: What are the obstacles that hinder the implementation of a take back scheme that would increase the circularity of the Norwegian plastic pipe industry?

RQ2: What are the potentials for increasing the circularity in the Norwegian plastic pipe industry?

RQ3: How might the process for the recycling of plastic waste in the Norwegian plastic pipe industry look to overcome the obstacles and exploit the potential for increased circularity?

The methodology used to answer the research questions were a literature study, a case study and surveys. The literature study was used to gain an overview of the status of research in the field, support the findings of the case study and surveys and build a stronger foundation for the thesis. The case study was chosen to investigate the case company, the Norwegian plastic pipe industry and solutions in other countries. The surveys were chosen to gather first-hand information from actors in the plastic pipe industry. The findings from all these methods were used to develop a suggestion for a take back scheme in the Norwegian plastic pipe industry.

The study performed for this thesis revealed that there are obstacles hindering the implementation of a take back scheme in the Norwegian plastic pipe industry. These obstacles are related to the nature of the projects that arise, strict quality requirement in the industry, economical factors and financing of the scheme and the inherent linear thinking. Even though there are obstacles, there is also potential for implementing a take back scheme. Based on the survey responses, the actors of the industry are positive to such a change. They see many benefits of the scheme, however, they are dependent on economical factors to ensure participation. If solutions are found for the economical challenges of the scheme, there will be great potential. The obstacles must be overcome and linear attitudes must be changed. There needs to be focus on long-term effects of the scheme, joint support of stakeholders and circular business models.

The suggestion for a take back scheme in the Norwegian plastic pipe industry is within four categories: materials and products collected, collection options, costs and cost distribution, and actors and responsibilities. Pipes produced in all three materials are included in the scheme and there are four collection options: container rental, collection points, big bags and self-delivery. The costs of the scheme are distributed between the actors, however, the pipe producers are expected to take on more of the financial liability for establishing the scheme. The pipe producers are also suggested to be responsible for the establishment and administration of the scheme in collaboration with the industry organization, while the remaining actors will be part of an association for the scheme. All the solutions are developed to meet the demands of the actors, while facilitating optimal material flows.

The objectives of the thesis can be said to be be reached and the research questions are answered. To conclude, there are obstacles hindering the implementation of a take back scheme in the Norwegian industry. However, if certain enablers are present there is also great potential for successful implementation. The suggested take back scheme is a good start for a transition in the industry, that must be further developed.

The main limitations of this study are connected to the qualitative nature of the study and the data collection. Quantitative considerations will strengthen the validity of the study, and the data foundation would have been strengthened by broadening the scope of the survey sent to actors in the Norwegian industry. There is also further research to be done. This is three-folded: the findings must be quantified to strengthen the suggestion, the remaining links of the logistics network must be developed and the solutions must be verified with actors in the industry.",emerging logistics solutions
Press releases and Public announcements,https://www.intereuropa.si/en/media-centre/press-releases-and-public-announcements/2007/01/1193-Intereuropa-with-new-logistics-solutions-in-Russia-and-the-Ukraine,N/A,"Koper, 30th January 2007: On 29th January 2007 the Supervisory Board of Intereuropa d.d. got informed on the feasibility study of the investment in logistics centre Moscow-Čechov and feasibility study of the investment in logistics centre in Kiev. Based on both studies presented, the Supervisory Board gave its consent to the Managing Board for investment project in Moscow in estimated value EUR 44,7 million and for investment project in logistics capacities in Kiev in estimated value EUR 15,6 million. Both investment projects are planned for year 2007.

Intereuropa, already present in Russia with the company Intereuropa East d.o.o. in Moscow, has already announced further investments in the Russian market. The main reason for that is a rising demand for logistics, ranging from storage to distribution of goods to the current and potential customers operating in the Russian Federation. The investment project Moscow-Čechov, estimated at EUR 44,7 million, envisions the purchase of land (43ha) at Čechow, located 42 km out of Moscow, and the erection of a new logistics centre and automobile terminal. The location of the new logistics centre and the automobile terminal is situated at the important transport connection Moscow-Kiev (M-2). For Intereuropa, this new logistical terminal means an extension of its logistics services offered in the market and a possibility for increasing the sales of comprehensive logistics services. New opportunities for cooperation with companies who are already operating in Russia will arise, and new business partners can be found there.

In the Ukraine, where the corporation is also already present with the company TEK Zahidtransservice,Intereuropa will purchase new land measuring 24 hectare in the suburbs of Kiev, for which ca. EUR 15,6 million will be assigned, and build a logistics centre and the automobile terminal there. Also the location in the suburbs of Kiev is situated at the important transport connection Moscow-Kiev.Intereuropa supports the eligibility of this investment by enhancing the business, developing new services and expansion of current operations in the Ukraine.

By following the economy trends on both markets of Russia and the Ukraine, Intereuropa wants to turn to advantage the rising trade exchange opportunities and to additionally strengthen its presence and position on both markets by building its own logistics infrastructure. The decision on investments in Russia and the Ukraine is concerning the future of the Intereuropa Group, which by these projects is spreading to developing markets and assuring its competitive advantage.",emerging logistics solutions

Oracle Introduces New Logistics Capabilities to Help Customers ...,https://www.oracle.com/es/news/zh-cn/announcement/oracle-introduces-new-logistics-capabilities-2022-02-14/,N/A,"To help organizations increase efficiency and value across their global supply chains, Oracle today announced new logistics management capabilities within Oracle Fusion Cloud Supply Chain & Manufacturing (SCM). The updates to Oracle Fusion Cloud Transportation Management and Oracle Fusion Cloud Global Trade Management can help organizations reduce costs and risk, improve customer experience, and become more adaptable to business disruptions.

The unpredictability of the past two years has created major logistics-related challenges for organizations as they navigate large fluctuations in supply and demand and major disruptions to their distribution networks. This has resulted in rising logistics costs and has also impacted organizations’ relationships with customers—in fact, a recent Oracle survey found that 87 percent of people have been negatively impacted by supply chain issues over the past year.

“Western Digital has multiple manufacturing locations in the U.S. and Asia, handling more than half a million shipments every year. Our supply chain ecosystem is extremely complex with multiple end markets each having unique service needs, and the disruptive events of the past two years added to that complexity on an exponential scale,” said Joseph Hodges, Director of Logistics Center of Excellence, Western Digital. “With Oracle Transportation Management as our foundation we have been able to streamline logistics processes and customer support, quickly achieving significant results—including reducing cost and service disruption through expansion of our partner base, implementing on-demand spot bidding, and dynamically shifting modes while operating with 90 percent touch-free automation in the last fiscal year. In addition, Oracle Transportation Management’s built-in machine learning capabilities have helped improve ETA accuracy from 64 percent to 93 percent, which is an invaluable result in terms of an improved customer experience.”

Oracle Transportation Management and Oracle Global Trade Management are continuously innovating to help organizations address logistics management challenges. Below are details on the new capabilities, which will help customers improve order fulfillment accuracy, reduce logistics costs, enhance the customer experience, and manage risk associated with unforeseen changes across their supply chains:

Intelligent Transit Time Predictions: A new machine learning algorithm in Oracle Transportation Management will enable users to evaluate the potential impact of both macro-level interruptions (including extreme weather or airport delays) and network-level disruptions (such as labor and capacity shortages). This can help customers more accurately predict delivery times and lower costs associated with delays, expedited shipments, and additional safety stock.

In developing these innovative software and hardware products, Westwell has made the most of its full-stack AI R&D capabilities and stood to the forefront of transforming logistics growth models, achieving unparalleled efficiency gains from green and low-carbon production methods.

Upgradeable New Energy Autonomous Driving Capacity

Westwell’s self-developed upgradeable autonomous heavy truck, E-Truck, made its debut at TOC Europe. As the world’s only intelligent electric heavy-duty truck capable of upgrading to autonomous driving, it is specifically designed to facilitate the transition to green, low-carbon freight logistics.

As a member of the Qomolo family, the E-truck utilizes the same drive-by-wire chassis as fully autonomous driving vehicles, with a reserved sensor interface for autonomous driving upgrade.

This design can accommodate the upgrade needs of customers throughout the product’s life cycle. Customers can electrify their vehicle fleets and achieve their green and low-carbon transportation goals by using E-Trucks.

These vehicles can be later upgraded to autonomous driving mode at a low cost and connected to Westwell’s intelligent autonomous driving system for better performance.

Q-Truck, a 24/7 autonomous new energy commercial vehicle, has also made its appearance again at TOC Europe, which is the world’s first autonomous electric heavy truck for intelligent container logistics. Together with the E-Truck, it forms a powerful zero-carbon transportation solution that is upgradeable, capable of battery swapping, and operates autonomously with high efficiency 24/7.

AI-based Management System Unleashes Energy Efficiency Potential

At last year’s TOC Europe, Westwell launched TerminalGPT, the world’s first AI-driven intelligent robot expert for container logistics. This pioneering system assists in enhancing decision-making and risk prediction.

This year, Westwell unveiled a comprehensive, all-scenario scheduling and coordination platform, REEWELL, driven by robust AI computing power.

Integrating various advanced software and hardware technologies to provide a core product set of scheduling (TOS), fleet management (WellFMS), veriﬁcation & simulation (WellSimtec), prediction and recommendation (TerminalGPT).

Additionally, the REEWELL can holistically mobilize fleets and equipment within the logistics site to formulate the optimal route for vehicle movement. It allows unprecedentedly smooth, safe, and efficient transportation and makes fleet management easier than ever for operators.

The World’s First Green Transition Whitepaper Covering Multiple Logistics Nodes

The green transition of logistics needs to be progressed in a gradual and systematic approach, where strategic guidance and advanced production tools are of equal importance.

In this connection, Westwell worked with Roland Berger, one of the world’s top-level strategic management consulting firms, to introduce the world’s first methodology for green transition covering multiple logistics nodes—2024 Freight Logistics Decarbonization Whitepaper.

The core of the whitepaper lies in the “LEAD” decarbonization methodology. It states that based on Digitalization (D), the decarbonization process is divided into three phases: Electrification (E), AI-driven Intelligence (A), and Linked Ecology (L).

This whitepaper provides systematic guidance for industry professionals to achieve their Decarbonization goals and gain “Economical-Friendly”, “Environment Friendly”, “People Friendly” values (DEEP).

With regard to where the logistics industry will go, Westwell has provided insight in its “Ainergy” strategy, which encompasses practicable methods and a full suite of intelligent new-energy software and hardware products across all logistics scenarios.

Logistics professionals visiting Westwell’s stand at TOC Europe 2024 will have a better understanding of the path toward green and intelligent transformation, and will reap the benefits in the near future.",emerging logistics solutions
The importance and benefits of logistics for businesses,https://www.infosysbpm.com/blogs/retail-cpg-logistics/logistics-importance-and-benefits.html,N/A,"Retail, CPG and Logistics

The importance and benefits of logistics for businesses

Logistics is the backbone of the supply chain and, subsequently, the entire business. The logistics management system employed by a company can either make it or break it. The global logistics market value reached almost $9,525 billion in 2021, according to a report entitled Global Logistics Market Report and Forecast 2022–2027. The market is anticipated to continue expanding at a CAGR of 5.7% between 2022 and 2027, driven by developments in technologies, to reach a value of approximately $13,326 billion by 2027.

What is logistics?

Logistics is a component of the supply chain that involves the flow of commodities from one point to another, typically through warehousing and transportation. In other words, the processes involved in transferring items internally or from the seller to the customer are collectively referred to as logistics. Logistics generally considers expenditure, the weight of the goods, and transportation, as well as other elements such as client satisfaction and access to adequate warehousing.

Logistics managers must consistently supervise the process' numerous intricacies and closely monitor several details. For example, transportation routes must be chosen based on convenience and efficiency, regulatory frameworks, and the minimisation of concerns such as road construction and repairs, armed conflicts, and inclement weather conditions. It is also important to carefully assess freight companies, packaging solutions, and their corresponding expenses.

The importance and advantages of logistics

Logistical solutions vary depending on the nature of the business and its product decisions, but the process is always complex. Not having competent logistics will dent a company’s bottom line. It can be crippling to the entire supply chain because, without proper logistics, there would be no movement of cash from customers to sellers.

Logistics primarily focuses on the movement of goods across various channels, but its implications stretch much further. In business, success in logistics translates to increased efficiencies, reduced costs, enhanced production rates, improved inventory management, efficient use of warehouses, higher client and vendor satisfaction, and better customer experiences. Companies that invest in an elaborate logistics management system enjoy the following benefits.

Real-time insights: Efficient logistics solutions offer greater transparency and real-time insights that businesses can effectively utilise to make informed decisions. By studying the output data and insights from logistics, organisations can identify supply chain issues and boost productivity by streamlining interactions. End-to-end supply chain visibility encourages growth and fosters the formation of beneficial partnerships between companies.

Panattoni is developing a new logistics site for Kühne ...,https://www.teamtosse.de/panattoni-is-developing-a-new-logistics-site-for-kuehnenagel-in-mecklenburg-vorpommern/?lang=en,N/A,"Panat­toni, the lead­ing project devel­op­er for indus­tri­al and logis­tics real estate in Europe, is build­ing a new logis­tics cen­tre for Kühne+Nagel in Wit­ten­burg. The glob­al spare parts logis­tics for a lead­ing com­pa­ny in the renew­able ener­gies sec­tor will be han­dled at the new site in Meck­len­burg-Vor­pom­mern in the future. Con­struc­tion will start at the begin­ning of March and the project is slat­ed to be com­plet­ed around the end of 2023/beginning of 2024.

The Kühne+Nagel Group, with more than 80,000 employ­ees at more than 1,300 sites in more than 100 coun­tries, is one of the world’s lead­ing logis­tics com­pa­nies. Its mar­ket posi­tion is in the areas of mar­itime logis­tics, air freight logis­tics, road logis­tics and con­tract logis­tics with a clear focus on inte­grat­ed logis­tics solu­tions. A glob­al spare parts ware­house will be built at the new site in Wit­ten­burg, Meck­len­burg-Vor­pom­mern, from which cus­tomers in Ger­many, Europe and world­wide can be sup­plied. Unload­ing, goods receiv­ing inspec­tions, stor­age intake, inven­to­ry, pick­ing, pack­ag­ing, load­ing and oth­er addi­tion­al ser­vices will also be car­ried out there.

Panat­toni is erect­ing the user-spe­cif­ic, build-to-suit (BTS) prop­er­ty on an area mea­sur­ing around 70,800 m². The grounds, which were used for agri­cul­tur­al pur­pos­es dur­ing the GDR era, have already been restored by the City of Wit­ten­burg. Once com­plet­ed, the new build­ing will offer a total usage area of around 36,500 m², of which approx. 21,000 m² are storage/technology hous­ing space, 1,150 m² are office/social spaces and 1,800 m² are mez­za­nine stor­age space. In addi­tion, there are around 2,500 m² of free stor­age space and 10,000 m² for an expan­sion area to accom­mo­date the end customer’s future growth. The build­ing will be equipped with a haz­ardous sub­stances unit and WGK foil (water haz­ard class). The effec­tive height of the halls is 12.20 m (to bot­tom of gird­ers). In addi­tion, 100 pas­sen­ger vehi­cle park­ing spaces and exten­sive green and com­pen­sa­tion areas will be built on the out­door premises.

“We are thrilled to have found a part­ner in Panat­toni who will com­pe­tent­ly and pre­cise­ly imple­ment our require­ments. As a result, a logis­tics cen­tre that is excel­lent­ly suit­ed for the glob­al dis­patch of spare parts will be built near the customer’s exist­ing site in Meck­len­burg-Vor­pom­mern. As a pio­neer in the logis­tics sec­tor, it is par­tic­u­lar­ly impor­tant to us that we make our con­tri­bu­tion towards a car­bon-free future. In addi­tion to cer­ti­fied, mul­ti-modal CO 2 cal­cu­la­tion and report­ing, elec­tric­i­ty exclu­sive­ly from renew­able ener­gy sources and sus­tain­able pack­ag­ing in line with the con­cept of ‘reduce, reuse, recy­cle, replace´, we also place great val­ue on a sus­tain­able site,” says Mark Klausen, Head of Real Estate Ger­many at Kühne+Nagel.

In the frame­work of the devel­op­ment, Panat­toni will focus on a sus­tain­able design and strive to obtain cer­ti­fi­ca­tion accord­ing to the DGNB gold stan­dard. To achieve this objec­tive, the devel­op­er, in con­sul­ta­tion with Kühne+Nagel, will be imple­ment­ing com­pre­hen­sive sus­tain­abil­i­ty mea­sures. In addi­tion to air-water heat pumps for the office and social spaces, an intel­li­gent ener­gy man­age­ment sys­tem with dig­i­tal coun­ters will be installed to save ener­gy and opti­mise con­sump­tion. The devel­op­er will also install LED light­ing and cis­terns which allow rain­wa­ter to be used to flush toi­lets and water the out­door instal­la­tions. Charg­ing sta­tions for elec­tric vehi­cles and elec­tric bikes will pro­vide for low-emis­sions mobil­i­ty solu­tions, and the roof struc­ture on the new build­ing will be pre-equipped for a pho­to­voltaics sys­tem. The devel­op­er will also set up nest­ing box­es for bats, birds and bee­hives and cre­ate well-being areas for employ­ees. Last, but not least, the instal­la­tion of green roofs and the use of per­me­able mate­ri­als for the cen­tral sprin­kler sys­tem and smoking/bicycle shel­ters are planned.

The new logis­tics cen­tre will be built in the “Auf der Hei­de” busi­ness park which is cur­rent­ly being devel­oped and con­nect­ed to infra­struc­ture by the City of Wit­ten­burg. Due to the direct con­nec­tion to the A24 fed­er­al motor­way, which con­nects Berlin and Ham­burg, the prop­er­ty is in a good strate­gic location.

Berit Stein­berg, CEO of Wirtschafts­förderung Süd­west­meck­len­burg (South­west­ern Meck­len­burg Eco­nom­ic Devel­op­ment), accom­pa­nied the set­tle­ment process from the onset and thus con­tributed towards the imple­men­ta­tion at the Wit­ten­burg site. She says, about the project, “The devel­op­ment of the new site for the well-known logis­tics com­pa­ny Kühne+Nagel in Wit­ten­burg is a huge win for the entire region. The estab­lish­ment of new com­pa­nies and the cre­ation of new jobs in South­west­ern Meck­len­burg is the pri­ma­ry objec­tive of our work as an eco­nom­ic devel­op­ment com­pa­ny. The con­struc­tion of the new logis­tics cen­tre will con­tribute towards our district’s eco­nom­ic pow­er and show that South­west­ern Meck­len­burg is an attrac­tive loca­tion for com­pa­nies that want to grow.”

Chris­t­ian Greger, May­or of the City of Wit­ten­burg, is also pleased about the new estab­lish­ment. “The logis­tics cen­tre for Kühne+Nagel, which will be built in the new ‘Auf der Hei­de´ busi­ness park, will cre­ate around 75 new jobs and is a real boon for Wit­ten­burg as an eco­nom­ic loca­tion. The simul­ta­ne­ous devel­op­ment of the busi­ness park required close coor­di­na­tion with the devel­op­er, Panat­toni, as well as oth­er author­i­ties. Thanks to the con­struc­tive coop­er­a­tion, we were able to set a high­ly ambi­tious schedule.”

“In Wit­ten­burg, we are con­struct­ing a tai­lor-made prop­er­ty that meets Kühne+Nagel’s com­plex require­ments. There­fore, a site in a strate­gi­cal­ly good loca­tion for the end cus­tomer had to be found. It also had to be close to the cur­rent site in Meck­len­burg-Vor­pom­mern. At the request of the logis­tics ser­vice provider, the build­ings need­ed to be gener­ic ware­hous­es with a high degree of third-par­ty usabil­i­ty for sub­se­quent ten­ants from the pro­duc­tion, light indus­tri­al and logis­tics sec­tors.

SAMEDAYLOGISTICS invests in fast growing logistics newcomer Modus Operations, AB

Modus Operations AB, a young and dynamic Italo-Swedish time-critical start-up, was founded in 2018 by Luca Fossati and Roberto Quartieri, two Italian entrepreneurs, who were inspired by the perception that world-class-emergency logistics would find numerous satisfied customers in Italy, due to the poor general logistic performance in the market. Concentrating on Onboard Courier-Services in the beginning, e.g. for exclusive Italian fashion brands in Milan, they succeeded to rapidly grow their customer base, product portfolio, and business KPIs accordingly. Having built up a two-country-approach with offices in Sweden (Visby) and Italy (Milan) right from the start, Modus Operations shows a country coverage in the Northern and Southern parts of Europe which is perfectly complementary to thehubs in Germany, Eastern Europe, and the US.Roberto Quartieri, Co-CEO of Modus Operations: “We are extremely happy thatdecided to invest into Modus Operations, as we will be heavily supported in growing quickly and scaling professionally. We will get both, material and personal resources as well as in-depth-understanding into the nature of our operation. That is what mere financial investors would not have provided to us.”Holger Zulauf, CEO: “The whole Sameday-family is fascinated by the entrepreneurial power and the engagement that Luca and Roberto have shown to get their business where they are today. We are looking forward to being inspired by them with their innovative concepts, but certainly also embrace the fact that we can now enlarge our footprint into the North and South of Europe, thus dramatically extending our reach.”Modus Operations AB was founded in 2018 by two Italian entrepreneurs, Luca Fossati and Roberto Quartieri. Both had been involved into high standard customer service organizations as well as emergency logistics operations before Modus. Being convinced that emergency logistic performance could be dramatically improved, especially in Italy, they decided to launch Modus Operations AB and succeeded to build a profitable business with double digit growth rates. www.modusoperations.se Since its foundation in 1996,developed into the leading European provider for industrial emergency logistics with approx. 40.000 OBC-Services and an uncountable number of specialty transports conducted over time.is part of the, an international group of specialized logistics service providers, and operates locations in Germany, Czech Republic, Romania and the United States of America. www.samedaylogistics.de (Kelsterbach, 26.02.2021)

Samedaylogistics, a leading global supplier of priority and customized emergency transports, repetitiously secures medical transportation from China to Europe addressing urgent needs to fight the current Corona-pandemic

The current global fight against the Corona-pandemic creates numerous challenges for all kinds of industries. For the logistics sector, one of the key issues is the vast cancellation of passenger flights, leading to a serious scarcity also in freight capacity. Mere freight flights, on the other hand, are dramatically overbooked, so numerous urgent and time-critical transport requirements, i.e. for medical equipment from China to Europe, cannot be addressed., as a leading supplier of customized emergency transports, is actively filling this critical gap by providing vacant freight capacity up to full charter arrangements, so to secure that vital material against the pandemic is being moved, especially from China into Germany. Customers include national and regional state authorities, as well as medical charity organizations.One of those transports received a considerable press coverage, when the ruling mayor of Berlin, Mr. Michael Müller announced via Twitter on the 4th of April , that more than 2 million face masks and 300.000 protective gowns were successfully shipped to Berlin, for subsequent distribution to hospitals, retirement homes and the police. To execute this urgent and time-critical delivery, Samedaylogistics provided a Boeing B747 Aircraft-charter, managed the on- and off-loading of the material and took care of the full custom clearance around the delivery.(Kelsterbach, 15.04.2020)

Shippie enables On-Demand Consumer Logistics

Owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, online shopping for groceries and other daily essentials has significantly increased. The pressure on logistics operations to deliver products in spite of COVID-19 pushes logistics companies to adopt innovative methods that take multiple aspects of the pandemic, such as social distancing, into consideration. As a result, startups and scaleups develop contactless pickup and same-day delivery of consumer goods in cities around the world.

The US-based startup Shippie builds an on-demand consumer-to-consumer logistics platform that allows anyone to send and receive masks, toilet paper, household supplies, and more within their local communities. The startup’s solution is originally based on a peer-to-peer (P2P) laundry service mobile application as a response to COVID-19. In order to limit COVID-19 exposure, the startup supports no-touch remote pickup & delivery for customers with porches & secure buildings. Customers simply place their items in a secure container, box, or bag and place an order on the website for them to be picked up and delivered.

Meili Robots develops an Integrated Mobile Robots Fleet Management System

Fully automated warehouses utilize mobile robots for sorting packages and autonomous forklifts for picking products from shelves. Loading and unloading goods into transport vehicles is also automated in such warehouses. An integrated fleet management system for such automated warehouses increases productivity, efficiency, and reduces the pressure on the human workforce. Considering the pandemic, startups develop integration platforms to operate fully automated warehouses and reduce the level of human involvement.

Danish startup Meili Robots develops an integrated mobile robots fleet management system. The startup’s solution finds applications in industries where autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) or automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are operating. For example intralogistics operations, warehousing, and robot delivery services. Further, the platform updates the maps of warehouses by adding new details including safe zones, obstacles, stations/points, and operational areas.

NEXT4 offers Real-Time Shipment Tracking

The seamless functioning of ports requires human resources, leading to restricted operations during the Coronavirus pandemic. Moreover, the estimated time of arrivals (ETAs) of overseas shipments continuously changes due to delays owing to reduced manpower. As a result, startups develop solutions that track shipments in real-time by taking the various delays that occur at each stage of the supply chain into consideration.

French startup NEXT4 offers dynamic estimated time of arrivals calculations to enable better visibility for tracking overseas shipments. The startup calculates ETAs based on previous shipments with the same departure and destination. As a result, the accuracy of estimations increases with the number of shipments carried out. Moreover, based on the events taking place during the transport and the duration of each step of the trip, this estimation of arrival is constantly updated along the route for better visibility and agility. This allows companies to improve their planning and scheduling of transit times as well as reception of goods.

CargoLedger leverages Blockchain to enable Paperless Logistics Operations

Social distancing and self-isolation are key methods that slow the spread of coronavirus. Digital transformation efforts, for example, paperless logistics operations successfully complement social distancing norms while reducing waste generation. Blockchain technology, in particular, enables all stakeholders to have real-time traceability of transactions, way-bills, and other important documents, allowing logistics companies to better function in spite of COVID.

Dutch startup CargoLedger leverages blockchain technology to transform manual logistics operations into a paperless format. The startup’s solution reduces inefficiencies, controls and audits tasks with smart contracts, creates immutable data and enables instant settlement. This digital transformation reduces risk, saves time and money. Moreover, it eliminates manual data-entries and lessens the need for validation and verification costs thus making the supply chain more agile now – and post-COVID.

Travelhorse develops a Logistics Platform for Last-Mile Deliveries

Staying indoors has increased the reliance on last-mile delivery options across the world. Now more than ever, efficient and effective last-mile delivery is critical for logistics operations. COVID-19 is encouraging startups to develop experimental supply chain models to increase parcel volume, expedite deliveries, and delight customers.

Singaporean startup Travelhorse develops DASH, a logistics platform for last-mile deliveries. DASH includes route planning, dedicated fleet services, electronic proof of contactless delivery. Additionally, the startup enables same-day deliveries for food and beverage products.

Flexport.org,https://www.unicef.org/partnerships/flexportorg,N/A,"UNICEF and Flexport.org, the impact arm of global supply chain technology leader, Flexport, have joined forces in a partnership aimed at providing humanitarian supplies to children in need worldwide. This collaboration, which began in 2021, has already made strides in expanding access to critical supplies and services for vulnerable children and their families in several countries, including Afghanistan, Chad, Ethiopia, Pakistan, Ukraine, Venezuela and Yemen.

One of the key achievements of the UNICEF-Flexport.org partnership is the delivery of over 1.1 million pounds (almost 500 metric tonnes) of critical supplies for UNICEF's global humanitarian relief efforts. These supplies have included life-saving essentials such as ready-to-use therapeutic food, syringes for vaccinations, WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) supplies, diapers, blankets and water tanks, as well as stock replenishment and cold storage.

“Supply chains come under intense pressure during emergencies,” said Etleva Kadilli, Director of UNICEF’s global supply and logistics operations. “This partnership with Flexport.org will help UNICEF to address bottlenecks and quickly deliver life-saving supplies to children and their communities in times of crisis. We are grateful for the support and collaboration of Flexport.org to find supply chain and logistics solutions so that no child is left behind.”

The UNICEF-Flexport.org partnership has also been engaged in strategic supply chain planning to develop innovative solutions that increase access to essential supplies in the hardest-to-reach places. This includes exploring new technologies, processes and partnerships that can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of humanitarian supply chains. By leveraging their combined expertise, assets, and networks, UNICEF and Flexport.org are constantly seeking ways to overcome logistics bottlenecks and improve the delivery of humanitarian supplies to children in need, especially in remote and challenging locations.

""Our partnership with UNICEF amplifies our shared mission of navigating supply chain intricacies to deliver life-saving essentials to the most vulnerable communities,” said Teresa Carlson, President and Chief Commercial Officer of Flexport. “Through our shared commitment, we’ve made an incredible impact to date – this expansion of our partnership allows us to deliver resources and opportunities to children in need, building a brighter future for all.""

In addition to the transportation of supplies, the UNICEF-Flexport.org partnership has also provided emergency logistics solutions as situations arise. This has included warehousing services, bespoke logistics support, and targeted expertise to ensure that the right supplies reach the right places at the right time during humanitarian emergencies.

These logistics solutions have been crucial in enabling UNICEF to respond rapidly and effectively to complex and evolving crises, ensuring that children in need receive the assistance they require promptly.

Furthermore, the partnership aligns with UNICEF's commitment to promoting sustainability in its humanitarian response efforts.

This sustainability focus demonstrates the commitment of UNICEF and Flexport.org to not only address the immediate needs of children in emergencies but also promote long-term sustainability and resilience in humanitarian operations.

Department of Defense prepares for new logistics solutions,https://inventu.com/blog/?p=955,N/A,"As this blog has discussed previously, the Department of Defense (DoD) is attempting to modernize its IT offering by using innovative systems. One of the specific ways it is fulfilling this goal is through a special plan set to safeguard the defense medical logistics standard support (DLMSS) network until 2018. Army Technology notes that the plan has been made possible through support from CACI International, Inc.

The investment in this system is significant because it controls multiple important functions the government relies upon, including managing supplies that benefit different facilities around the world. With CACI supporting it, the DoD hopes to address federal civilian issues, eventually, as well as adapting it for the Department of Veterans Affairs.

However, despite the initiative this agency is taking to improve its tech functions, the Department must keep up with new technological changes to make its logistics sustainable. Writing for GCN, Kevin Deal outlined several advances that stand to disrupt the organization's current logistics systems, including context-sensitive systems, augmented reality and mobile apps.

""Over the next 20 years, we will see the full integration of operations, maintenance and the supply chain into a 'logistics support enterprise""' alongside the current modular applications-based enterprise resource management software,"" Deal writes. ""These new agile solutions are easing the time and pain associated with adapting processes using the more traditional, monolithic ERP systems.""

With easy-to-implement mainframe modernization options, government organizations will be able to make applications available throughout the supply chain.

MANAGING THE SUPPLY CHAIN: THE INTERNET AS ...,https://iveybusinessjournal.com/publication/managing-the-supply-chain-the-internet-as-energizer/,N/A,"A supply chain may still be a supply chain. What’s changed through is how you can – and need to – manage it.

Managing the supply chain has always been a critical yet challenging activity for almost all companies. This paradox was illustrated in a survey of over 200 companies conducted by Deloitte & Touche in 1998/99. Eighty percent of respondents admitted that using an SCM-specific application was critical to improving the accuracy, timeliness and flow of information in their organizations. Yet, just two percent said they considered their current supply chains to be world class.

One of the key reasons why so many respondents feel their supply chains are lacking is the continued rapid evolution of supply-chain techniques, processes and applications. This evolution—perhaps more of a “revolution” since that is what makes it so difficult to keep supply-chain management current, let alone cutting edge—will continue in earnest as companies begin using the Internet to further optimize their supply chains.

Within three years, the global value of business-to-business e-commerce is projected to exceed $2.9 trillion (all figures are in U.S. dollars unless otherwise stated). A large percentage of that will be channelled through Web enabled supply-chain applications. Over 40 percent of respondents in the Deloitte & Touche survey said they planned to strengthen their supply chains by implementing Internet-based relationships with their suppliers within 12 to 18 months.

Traditionally, supply-chain optimization focused on improving supply-chain processes within the organization by better integrating the activities of various functions. The Internet enables processes between organizations to be improved by more closely bringing together the four key supply-chain elements suppliers, manufacturers, customers and consumers in the following equation: connectivity = collaboration = visibility = speed. What does that mean in real terms? Here’s a case in point: On any morning after 4 a.m., any of Wal-Mart’s 7,000 suppliers can get into a Wal-Mart database and learn how many of their products each store has sold over a two-year period ending the previous night!

THE EVOLUTION OF SUPPLY-CHAIN MANAGEMENT

Supply-chain management is not a new challenge. However, the opportunities created by the Internet are new. The figure below illustrates the four major steps in supply-chain evolution.

The first, dating from the 1960s, has its origins in basic computerized applications, particularly Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). These applications automated routine transactions—such as purchase orders, shipping manifests, invoices, receipt notices and more—helping to make the supply chain faster, better and usually cheaper.

Step two was often a byproduct of the ERP (enterprise resource planning) systems that organizations implemented to achieve Y2K compatibility. Many companies added specific supply chain applications to improve dynamic planning, considering both capacity and material constraints, to achieve what is referred to as Advanced Planning Systems (APS).

This article focuses on steps three and four—those in the near and only slightly more distant future. The supply-chain techniques in these steps offer dramatically new opportunities even though they are not entirely novel. Many are adaptations of elements that have existed before.

The applications that characterize the third step of supply-chain evolution include:

Web-enabled EDI

Web-enabled Systems (ERP)

E-procurement (MRO and Catalogue)\

Auctions, exchanges and other infomediaries

Step four is based on more advanced techniques:

Collaborative product design and e-manufacturing, and

Collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment (CPFR).

This article will discuss each technique, and include some background, proprietary data or survey information which readers may use to benchmark their own organizations’ activities. It will also discuss some real examples taken from extensive research of current supply-chain practices.

WEB-ENABLED EDI

EDI was an early, but effective, supply-chain management technique. It is credited with a number of important benefits: manufacturing on demand, just-in-time delivery (JIT), vendor-managed inventory (VMI), electronic funds transfer or settlement (EFT), efficient consumer response (ECR) and, in retailing, quick response (QR). True, it is often difficult to put a precise monetary value on these benefits; however, the cost savings are easily quantifiable: paper and postage savings, shortened receivable cycles and fewer personnel for data entry, to name just a few.

However, traditional EDI has not been without its problems. It is normally suited to routine transactions only, lacks a decision-making capability, is inflexible, is not “real time” and, in many cases, is costly. For these reasons, EDI has been primarily for the big players whose value-added networks (VANs)—essentially, private communications networks between trading partners were a similar, though much more modest version of today’s Internet. (With its greater scale and number of users, the Internet is a cheaper alternative to VANs and, as a result, has already started to absorb them.)

However, despite being a similar—though much more powerful and sophisticated—application, the Internet won’t kill EDI. It will merely change it.

EDI will survive because of its functionality—companies still need high-speed, integrated, automated messaging systems. However the technology that enables that functionality will change (EDI software firms are already introducing “Internet EDI”) and become more streamlined. For example, traditional EDI requires separate software applications for each step of collecting, defining and organizing data; translating that information into an EDI standard; and then communicating it. With the Internet, all of those tasks can be done with just one piece of software—a browser.

Consider what this means at the simplest level of efficiency in a supply chain, such as the everyday task of shipping products to customers. A company transacts with its customers through purchase orders or point-of-sale. That, in turn, is linked to an invoice that flags a receivable, and the company schedules a carrier to deliver the product. For customers, however, the carrier represents the company’s service level, meaning that the company is only as strong as the middleman’s link to its customers. Similar relationships exist between the company and its carriers and buyers for its legal and financial transactions.

Here is an example of how one company uses Web-enabled EDI to optimize its supply-chain links to its customers.

Owens Corning, the company that invented glass fibre, is perhaps best known for its Pink fibreglass insulation. The company uses Web-enabled EDI for routine transactions. It allows its customers to determine the size of their orders based on cube/weight cost, or whether they want to build a truckload exclusively for their own order rather than split a load by using a less-than-truckload (LTL) shipment.

Here is how it is done. Owens Corning’s Purchase Express II™ is a fully secured, Internet-based order processing tool. It allows on-line pricing, truckload sizing, order entry, acknowledgment, invoicing and status checking. The EDI technology is invisible to customers who use the Internet to enter Owens Corning’s password protected extranet to place their orders. The software automatically converts the product quantities entered by customers into truck loading logic. The cube logic then calculates the percentage of a truck that each order represents and provides the customer with a visual display of a truck cube with its appropriate costs.

WEB-ENABLED SYSTEMS (ERP)

Most of the 200 respondents in Deloitte & Touche’s supply-chain survey reported that they use the Internet as a marketing and communications tool. One-third use the Web to communicate or share information with their strategic supply-chain partners, particularly about purchase-order entry/tracking and inventory replenishment. Within two years, almost 60 percent of respondents said they expected to be using the Web for that purpose.

Businesses expect that Web-enabled systems will provide real benefits (primarily, cost reductions and improved performance) in the areas of improved customer service, reduced inventory, lower supply-chain costs, improved delivery date accuracy, enhanced management control and decreased order-fulfillment cycle time.

Imation and Menlo Logistics have partnered in a real-life example of Web-enabled ERP (which also includes features of Web-enabled EDI). Imation, a 3M subsidiary, manufactures data storage and imaging products while Menlo Logistics is a full-service contract-logistics company. Their partnership involves the Internet, an ERP system (in this case Oracle) and EDI to schedule orders for carrier companies.

The figure blow illustrates how the process works. The upper left portion of the diagram depicts customers entering and placing their orders through ERP. The lower left portion shows how carriers access the system through EDI (which is still the convention in the transportation industry). That links them to individual customer orders through Imation’s Oracle System (ERP). Menlo’s EDI system connects to freight systems that allow the carriers to view their order status, size, weight and other details.

While the process diagram may be complicated, the Web page that customers and carriers use is much cleaner. It provides distinct, easy-to-find and logically organized links to give users with information on the things that matter to them: transit times, rates and routing information, shipment tracking, shipping location information, contingency shipping information and more.

The Oracle link provides a Web-enabled track and trace tool that allows users to search by customer order. Once the order is located, they can view the status of their orders by date and real time at each stage in the process—when the order was created by Imation, received by Menlo, sent to the warehouse, shipped, in transit and delivered. Users can also view the details of each individual shipment, even when a single order involves multiple shipments.

For carriers and customers, the system is ideal. Companies with high volume and/or multiple shipments for a single order receive even greater benefits because it frees their order entry and shipping departments from dealing with multiple carriers over the phone and scheduling pickups and other arrangements with each of them individually. Customers who want to know important information, such as their freight charges, can access that information as the load progresses, when it is complete or even before it is processed prior to shipping.

Another example, in this case using Web-enabled GPS (Global Positioning System), links satellite technology to the Internet. Cemex, a cement and concrete company operating in Mexico, the U.S. and South America, has arranged this marriage of outer space and cyberspace. Cemex was a fast-growing company (its sales jumped 40 percent from 1997 to 1998) with a serious problem. Its customers are construction companies that cannot afford to have work crews standing idle while waiting for concrete to arrive on the job site. Because Cemex had problems delivering its product on time, half of the orders it received were being cancelled, changed or rescheduled.

Cemex’s Web-enabled GPS provides the company and its customers with a central tracking system—or, if you prefer, the dynamic synchronization of operations. The system links customers to Cemex’s GPS-equipped fleet. The result? Since orders can be tracked wherever they are, deliveries now arrive within 20 minutes of their scheduled time. The company has increased its fleet productivity by 35 percent, and saved on its costs for fuel, maintenance and payroll. Most importantly, it has eliminated order cancellations.

E-PROCUREMENT (MRO & CATALOGUE)

Today, few activities are gaining as much attention as e-procurement. The reason is simple: It offers companies an extremely rapid payback (sometimes within two months) and allows them to address problems such as inefficient buying, redundant processes, non-strategic sourcing, too much paper and unreliable shipping.

Maintenance, repairs and operations (MRO) represents about 36 percent of the indirect goods and services a company purchases—typically at a cost of $79 per transaction. It includes purchases of office equipment and supplies; computer and IT equipment; piping, electrical and HVAC suppliers; legal and professional services; utilities and communications; catering and food services; material handling supplies; advertising and marketing suppliers; travel and entertainment. It includes everything down to and including the purchase of nuts, bolts, nails and screws.

The reason why MRO e-procurement is so successful and, therefore, so popular is that it performs four critical functions:

It allows employees to do their own purchasing they’re doing it already, hence the high levels of “maverick” buying that exist in most companies. However, MRO e-procurement controls that through systems that automate the routing and approval process to arrange purchases through “approved” suppliers. It enables customers to place orders, configure-to-order a product, track progress through the supply chain and undertake all the other tasks consistent with order fulfillment. That allows the company to reduce its need for customer support staff while improving its timeliness and the availability of its service. It increases the company’s leverage with key suppliers. By combining individual employee orders with each supplier, the company can negotiate better volume discounts and better monitor the supplier’s performance. Finally, and certainly not least, MRO e-procurement reduces costs by cutting requisition cycle time, administrative bureaucracy, individual transaction costs and the costs of paper-based transactions.

On-line catalogues and self-service work best for non-routine transactions or in fragmented markets. These Web-based sites bring together many scattered buyers and sellers in one location and offer useful tools such as order status checking; shipping status checking; virtual design centres; instant live help; a tool for quoting costs; and a savings calculator. An example of such an on-line catalogue is SciQuest.com (“The Internet Source for Scientific Products”) which brings together the comparatively fragmented universe of scientific supply vendors and customers.

Many companies also maintain their own on-line catalogues. Cisco a computer networking company, receives 75 percent of its orders over the Internet, 80 percent of which are booked, credit checked, scheduled and manufactured automatically—without human intervention. 3Com (known for its PalmPilot computing organizers) credits its on-line catalogue for a 95-percent reduction in cost-per-purchase calls as well as millions of dollars in inventory savings.

Of course, computer and technology companies would be expected to utilize and benefit from Web-based supply-chain techniques. However, other types of companies have also achieved equally impressive benefits. UPS, the world’s largest parcel carrier, has a self-service Web site that enables customers to place, track and trace their own orders. The timely, seven-day-a-week, round-the-clock operation has reduced UPS’s need for live agents, call-centre contacts and long, interactive voice-response queues. It has also helped the company increase its customer satisfaction levels.

Livingston International Inc., a Canadian logistics management and customs brokerage firm, has focused on a clearly defined market opportunity, capturing an end-to-end order fulfillment business through its subsidiary, ProCure.com Inc. Livingston manages the logistics for the Canadian Pharmaceutical Distribution Network (CPDN). Its ProCure.com Web site brings together 14 hospitals (the customers) and 28 CPDN manufacturers (the suppliers).

ProCure.com is a unique on-line catalogue which hospitals can use to purchase pharmaceutical supplies. The site enables a hospital to place a single order for multiple products from multiple manufacturers, even if each has a distinct pricing and service requirement. They can also order narcotic products that require a “chain of custody” (ProCure.com is the only government- and RCMP-approved vendor of narcotics over the Internet). All of these purchases can be made via a Web-based browser, a point-of-scale device such as a bar-code reader, or a PalmPilot.

The figure below illustrates how the process works. Each hospital’s order is certified and validated before being sent to the appropriate supplier. The hospital is sent a shipping notice and, when it receives its order, sends an order confirmation back to ProCure.com. Similarly, shipping notices and order confirmations are also exchanged between ProCure.com and the pharmaceutical suppliers.

Health Canada has approved the system’s security components that guarantee privacy and ensure that transactions between senders and receivers remain confidential. The system includes authentication by verifying the customer’s identity before orders are processed. Each transaction received is matched to the transaction that is sent, and proof is provided that transactions actually took place. ProCure.com is exploring ways to further strengthen its security components, including a digital signature scheme for pharmacists or practitioners to provide a “signed receipt” for the drugs they have ordered.

AUCTIONS, EXCHANGES AND OTHER INFOMEDIARIES

Infomediaries are virtual third parties that bring buyers and sellers together. There are many of them and they facilitate business-to-business, business-to-consumer and consumer-to-consumer transactions.

Exchanges provide suppliers with an opportunity to expand their customer bases, manage excess supply and reduce their transaction and marketing costs. Buyers, on the other hand, get to expand their bases of suppliers, find better prices and lower their purchasing costs. The process is particularly effective in matching fragmented suppliers and buyers in markets for near-commodity items. It works in real time, with a bid-ask matching process, and provides market-wide price determination and clearing.

E-Steel, The Global Marketplace for Steel, is one example of an exchange. Users enter the system and work their way through a series of Web screens, some of which are described below.

Create inquiries to buy—buyers select the product type they wish to purchase and specify particular details about that product

Commercial terms buyers specify sales terms such as price and delivery times

Seller—buyers select the “audience” or potential vendors who will be asked to bid on the transaction

Confirm inquiry—when the buyer’s price and sales terms are matched to those of a supplier, the buyer receives an order confirmation

Tracker—buyers can enter the system to track their order as it moves from the manufacturer to them.

In 1993, the National Transportation Exchange (NTE) began providing a real-time, neutral, interactive electronic commerce system that enabled members to improve their transportation activities. Through the Web, the NTE provides real-time services for shippers tendering loads and for transportation carriers tendering space available for freight. Currently, the NTE has 350 users (shippers, consignees, contract and dedicated logistic forwarders and brokers) with a total network of 100,000 vehicles and 60,000 originating and destination locations.

Here is how the NTE works. Shippers who face the problem of having orders that make up only partial truckloads input details of their shipping orders to the NTE. At the same time, carriers with capacity to fill, input information about their rote plans and available space. The NTE then matches shippers to carriers, based on space, order size and shipping terms (such as price). It sends a list of loads to each carrier, while sending shippers the necessary information about the carriers who will serve them. The NTE pays the carrier for the load, while invoicing the shipper.

Despite never touching the product, the NTE transacts 380,000 loads per year. Shippers participating in the NTE report increases in fulfillment speed, reductions in shipping costs and savings of five to 40 percent. Carriers claim 30 to 50-percent increases in asset utilization, wider customer bases and savings of between 15 to 30 percent.

On-line auctions are similar to exchanges in that they provide an interactive mechanism to match buyers and sellers. They also provide a means of testing prices and are expected to soon become one of the biggest areas of electronic commerce. Forrester Research, for example, predicts that by 2002, over half the on-line transactions will be conducted through auctions.

Auctions work best with unique, specialized or perishable products and services. One example is iMark.com, which says that it is in the business of simplifying surplus equipment trading worldwide. Through Web sites such as these, companies are able to deal with excess capital equipment, used products and non-salable returns.

A number of companies have been successful with on-line auctions. Ingram Micro, a worldwide distributor of computer technology, products and services, turned to an on-line auction to relieve its problem of rapid product cycles and fluctuating inventory levels. Caterpillar, the heavy construction equipment manufacturer, reports that it has achieved 10-percent savings through on-line auctions. United Technologies, a company serving the aerospace and building industries, projects auctions will enable it to achieve 35-percent savings.

COLLABORATIVE PRODUCT DESIGN AND E-MANUFACTURING

Supply-chain techniques in the fourth step are distinguished by the fact that they are collaborative. Two or more companies in the supply chain work together to reduce costs and increase efficiencies across the entire supply chain.

Within the manufacturing sector, attention has shifted from rationalization to increasing throughput, gaining greater agility through lean manufacturing, configure-to-order, concurrent engineering and collaborative product design, and outsourcing non-core functions. Manufacturers are using the Internet to help them achieve some of these goals.

For example, General Motors has provided its dealers with a variety of tools that allow them to become Web-enabled. Here is a description of three of them. GM Access, a configure-to-order tool that performs historical modelling of trends, helps dealers determine the number of vehicle models and features they will order based on past popularity. Suppose, however, that a customer wants to take immediate delivery of a vehicle that isn’t on a dealer’s lot. The dealer can use GM Buy Power, a Web-based network that provides a “live” view of all GM products available at a given time, by vehicle type and by dealership, to locate vehicles that match the customer’s specifications across GM and its dealerships. And if none exists, the dealer can use GM Prospect, a point-of-sale, spec-to-order tool that allows the sales associate to input the customer’s order directly into GM’s production facilities.

Amkor Technology, a semiconductor assembly and testing company, develops products in several plants. Each one simultaneously produces subassemblies that may be combined in a single order that is integrated after each plant has completed its assembly. Amkor worked with Camstar, an organization that focuses on plant floor operations, to develop a totally integrated factory solution that would optimize activity from order entry to product shipping.

Through the Internet and Camstar MES (Manufacturing Execution System), Amkor plants can report their yield for a particular day, before it is completed, through a Web-rollup by Bill of Material (BOM). This has enabled Amkor to increase the capacity of its plants, while decreasing cycletimes and downtimes. These efficiencies have enabled Amkor to run leaner, with fewer staff, while improving both quality and control over its products.

COLLABORATIVE PLANNING, FORECASTING AND REPLENISHMENT (CPFR)

Exchanges may be thought of as “focused” linkages between organizations to achieve specific objectives. A fuller realization of this technique lies in full virtual integration on a real-time basis, something most often referred to as CPFR.

In essence, CPFR involves fusing each company’s internal systems to those of its suppliers, partners and customers. To do this, however, all players must use a common “language” for their technological communications and have integrated Internet, EDI and other internal information systems (guidelines to facilitate and manage this process are available at www.cpfr.org).

The figure below illustrates why CPFR is attracting such interest. This simple matrix of the supply chain illustrates that the greatest opportunities lie in extending planning and delivery between companies across the entire supply chain. The order, sourcing and manufacturing activities that support this initiative are primarily routine transactions that can all be Web-based.

The figure also illustrates why ERP systems have done little to extend supply-chain connectivity. ERP applications are traditionally focused on processes within organizations, not between them. That is changing, however, as ERP vendors are introducing Web-enabled products to help support companies making their collaborative linkages.

Heineken USA Inc., the North American distributor for Heineken breweries, is one of the most exciting examples of collaborative supply-chain activity.

Heineken faced a North American supply-chain problem. It took the company three months to produce beer in Holland, ship it in containers to North America and then manually process orders for distributors in each state. Since beer has only a six-month shelf life, Heineken’s product was spending half of that time in the supply chain!

Heineken USA’s primary customers are 450 distributors. However, Heineken is a relatively small supplier for them (typically representing between two and 10 percent of a distributor’s business), something that limited its options for improving its supply chain. It would be too costly, for example, to install PCs or leased lines between it and its suppliers, and the distributors would balk at installing systems to run EDI setups for such a small component of their business.

Heineken’s solution was to use the Internet. It set up a Web-based system that its distributors could access for information about suggested forecasts, marketing and promotions, and order tracking and tracing. Distributors can also input information that allows Heineken to extract data regarding sales and inventory reporting, confirmation of forecasts or orders placed by distributors.

The resulting collaborative supply chain is widely recognized as state-of-the-art (it has won the Gartner Group ieC Award, VICS ’99 Best-in-Class Logistics, and the 1999 Food Processing Achievement Award). It works because it is a single, integrated plan extending across Heineken’s operations and distributors. It uses a common plan to drive all initial forecasting, which distributors can then receive and adjust. These collaborative forecasts then form the basis for orders, with seamless communications across sales, orders and inventory.

Because the process is Web-based, the infrastructure costs for Heineken have been comparatively low. However, the benefits have been significant. The company’s forecasting and planning ability has improved. Inventory turns have been reduced by approximately 10 days, a result of the automated, self-regulating inventories and order management enabled by CPFR. Order lead times have been reduced from three months to three to four weeks and the company believes they can be reduced further still.

There are also a number of softer, yet no less important, benefits. For example, Heineken’s customer service ratings have doubled since the system was introduced. Two-thirds of its distributors rated Heineken’s service as either excellent or good in 1999; four years earlier, just one-third of them felt that way. The effectiveness of the system has freed up time for Heineken’s sales team, giving them more opportunity to focus on selling rather than chasing tardy orders.

SUPPLY-CHAIN TRENDS TO WATCH FOR

The e-based solutions discussed in this article are real, highly effective new approaches to supply-chain management. However, the objectives that underlie them are the same ones that have always been a the heart of supply-chain issues. The nuts and bolts (Pos, invoices, ASNs and BOMs) are still the same; they are just being handled faster, better and definitely cheaper through the Internet.

What will supply chains be like in the future?

E-procurement, with its potential for large savings and fast paybacks, will continue to draw immediate attention from many companies> Routing transaction features will follow as one of the next areas of focus; watch for things to move into the mid-market.

As companies perfect a way of handling returns for e-commerce transactions, consumer confidence in e-business will increase dramatically. Meanwhile, virtual fulfillment companies will become more tangible. Amazon.com, for example, is currently spending $300 million to build three million square feet of warehouse to store its products.

There will be more virtual third-party logistics providers (3PLs) and new fourth-party logistics providers (4PLs)—essentially, the 4PLs will manage the 3PLs.

What should companies do when considering where to invest in their own supply chains?

First, remember that tangible methods of optimizing your supply chain will reduce your costs, while maximizing your service levels. Supply chains can be optimized through e-business by automating routine, non-routing transactions and by enabling greater collaboration with your customers and suppliers. Second, your EDI investment isn’t dead; the techniques described above illustrate how you can build upon it. Finally, how far you go in energizing your supply chain depends solely upon how much you want to try to do.",supply chain efficiency startup program

The 4 core elements of supply chain management,https://www.scjunction.com/blog/core-elements-supply-chain-management,N/A,"Your supply chain efficiency and effectiveness make a massive impact on the overall success of any business. To boost your business productivity and profitability further, you need to improve and optimise your supply chain.

In our experience, successful supply chain management in South Africa and the Middle East incorporates a consolidated supply chain strategy, instead of one that has been cobbled together as your business grows.

This is mission critical, especially in burgeoning markets in regions like the UAE and Middle East - according to a 2014 Deloitte survey, 79% of businesses with high-performance supply chains outperform their competitors. See the research here.

Focusing on the core elements of your supply chain can enable you to match this kind of performance.

What are the components of your supply chain you should be focusing on right now?

A properly designed supply chain strategy, with the core elements kept front and center, will give you a host of benefits including support of your business strategy, improved customer relationships and satisfaction, and efficiency, performance, response, and quality improvements.

1. INTEGRATION

Integration starts at your strategic planning phase and is critical throughout your communications and information sharing and data analysis and storage.

A single-view, accurate, and reliable source of information on your supply chain activities and details reduces human error, delays, shortages, and over/under-stocking, and allows you to plan for and mitigate supply issues or interruptions.

Assess your technology needs, and ensure your choice gives you the right tools to integrate your full supply chain solution while being flexible enough to change and grow with your business.

2. OPERATIONS

Your operations require an accurate, real-time representation of your inventory and production schedules in order to monitor your output and forecast production and distribution patterns.

With the right software, you are able to align your operations with the rest of your business, provide accurate and reliable information on the production and current inventories for more efficient fulfillment processes.

Improve your profitability by predicting likely interruptions and challenges to reduce their impact on your business, and streamline your operational processes to facilitate a smoother, less expensive path to fulfillment.

3. PURCHASING

The right supply chain software does a great deal in terms of sourcing products in your supply chain and ensuring you are taking advantage of the most competitive pricing and most reliable products.

Demand forecasting gives you a solid and practical method of ensuring you have right product, in the right quantity, at the right time.

Keep track of suppliers, competing producers, and demand cycles, so that you can reduce your operating costs across the sourcing and purchasing process.

4. DISTRIBUTION

The transport, delivery, and return of goods is a component of your supply chain that can always be simplified, optimised, and corrected for better client service and reduced operating costs.

With varying options of stock origin, your delivery and returns process should be centralised for a real-time view of inventory, order status and stock location regardless of whether an order originated in-store or online.

How A Unique Perspective Helps You See Global Supply ...,https://online.uark.edu/blog/how-a-unique-perspective-helps-you-see-global-supply-chains.php,N/A,"October 20, 2022 Editor's Note: This article was republished from Walton Insights, a blog of the Sam M. Walton College of Business. Share:

Adriana Rossiter Hofer

Adriana Rossiter Hofer brings a unique perspective to her role as director of the Global Engagement Office at the Sam M. Walton College of Business. Her research and teaching both focus on global supply chain issues, she has traveled extensively around the world and she speaks three languages.

But Hofer also is a native of Brazil, where she did undergraduate and graduate studies before taking part in a life-changing study abroad program and later moving to the United States to earn her Ph.D. Her international experiences in industry, academia, and life inform her insights about cultures and people, as well as business, which is critical in light of the increasingly international nature of supply chains.

We asked Dr. Hofer for some of her views on how higher education in general and the Walton College in particular are preparing the next generation of supply chain leaders for these global realities.

Question: You are really passionate about the value of having a global perspective. Where does that passion come from?

Hofer: A global perspective has been a big part of my life for as long as I can remember. Since I was a child, I've always been interested in different cultures. I've always learned different languages. I studied English. I studied Spanish. I studied French. But I couldn't travel anywhere, and in my hometown, there were not many foreigners. Then a study abroad experience when I was a young professional gave me an opportunity to spend a month in Seattle visiting companies and spending time with American families. It was amazing. I had spent all of my life watching American movies and studying English, so technically I knew about American culture and how Americans interact and work. But I can clearly say that I could only know and get to know America by spending time here. I really believe it's important for students to have that type of exposure.

âThe main way we equip our students is by exposing them to curricular and co-curricular opportunities that enhance their global perspective related to the management of supply chains.â Adriana Rossiter Hofer, Director, Global Engagement Office

Question: Why is a global education component relevant to supply chain management?

Hofer: Thanks to significant technological and regulatory advancements, supply chains continue to increase their global footprint. This is true not only for large, multinational companies, but for small businesses as well. It is easier than ever to reach consumers worldwide. At the same time, increased uncertainty in trade policies, fierce competition, and exponential growth in product variety make it even more challenging to manage these global supply chains. Not to mention an important lesson that companies learned the hard way during the pandemic: the need to design resilient and flexible global supply chains. Last but not least, the diversity in the workplace continues to require managers to exhibit an ability to work and do business with individuals and businesses from different cultural backgrounds. All these factors substantially enhance the complexity of designing and efficiently managing supply chain activities.

Question: How does the Walton College equip the next generation of supply chain leaders to succeed in such a challenging global business environment?

Hofer: The main way we equip our students is by exposing them to curricular and co-curricular opportunities that enhance their global perspective related to the management of supply chains.

Question: What are some specific ways the students are exposed to global perspectives while on campus?

Hofer: A global perspective is recurrent in the supply chain management curriculum here at the Walton College. In addition to a dedicated international logistics class, students are exposed to international experiences in different areas of supply chain management. Because all supply chain management concepts and principles are embedded in a global context, most of our curriculum content is taught from a global perspective. For instance, our procurement and supply management course covers best practices and the complexities inherent in selecting and managing suppliers located around the globe.

Another example would be our supply chain performance management and analytics course that covers global location decisions and measuring performance from a global perspective. And, naturally, our supply chain strategy course and integrated supply chain management course teach strategy and integration within the context of global supply chains.

Students also have the opportunity to have a minor in international business or they can take international business classes as electives. And, of course, having faculty from multiple nationalities â countries such as Russia, Germany, Brazil, Sri Lanka, and the Netherlands â brings a multicultural perspective into class discussions.

Question: What about opportunities to experience global supply chains first-hand?

Hofer: It's important for students to go and see, not just read and listen. Our students all have opportunities to study abroad and intern abroad, and we offer scholarships through the Walton College and Honors College.

The Walton College offers several short-term faculty-led programs in different regions of world, such as Ireland, Italy at the UA Rome Center, Chile, and Vietnam). These are short and intense focused learning experiences last between two to five weeks. Students learn about specific local business practices, and they compare and contrast those practices with those in the United States. They also gain an understanding as to why these practices are rooted in the country's history and culture.

We also offer semester-long exchanges in which students have the opportunity to spend one or two semesters in partner institutions around the world. This gives our students the opportunity to study at places like WHU-Otto Beisheim School of Management in Germany, City University in Hong Kong, Aarhus University in Denmark, the University of Essex in England, Kansai Gaidai University in Japan, Universidad de Carlos III de Madrid in Spain, and Jonkoping University in Sweden.

Internships abroad are another option to immerse in an international learning experience. Students engage in projects with companies abroad with defined deliverables. These opportunities give an incredible exposure of what it means to be immersed in a work environment with different communication, leadership, and project management practices.

But the reality is that all these opportunities require a substantial financial investment, and for this reason many students cannot afford to go abroad. So, one of the areas I am very excited about is the brand new Global Intelligence Badge, a co-curricular learning opportunity in which students engage in a set of pre-determined activities that require exposure and reflection of different nuances of managing businesses internationally. We also offer virtual international internships, in which students join projects in international companies and work with the company's team virtually. We have received great feedback from students and we are thrilled to offer opportunities for students to enhance their global education even if they are not able to travel abroad.

Question: What are some important concepts students learn, either in the classroom or experientially, about how international supply chains work?

Hofer: They gain a deep knowledge of global supply chain management business practices, market-specific knowledge, infrastructure, manufacturing, market conditions in the country, culture, economic and political conditions in the country, language skills, legal aspects of business in the country, the historic background of the country, and so forth. And they learn how the techniques and concepts they've learned in their classes are applied in different contexts.

For instance, they learn to compare and contrast global supply chain practices with the realities in the United States. They identify how U.S. businesses can adapt to be successful in other countries. And they identify how U.S. businesses can improve their supply chains thanks to best practices observed in other countries.

Question: Do they also learn specific skills that help them when they hit the workforce?

Hofer: Absolutely. In addition to knowledge areas, being in a study abroad program allows students to develop important skills that should impact their success in the workplace. Some of the skills they learn that employers value most would include cross-cultural communication skills, flexibility, independence, adaptability, ability to deal with ambiguity, problem solving skills, and intercultural awareness.

Question: How do you see global opportunities evolving in the future for supply chain students here in the Walton College?

Hofer: The opportunities for students are going to grow both in terms of curricular and co-curricular experiences. We are continuously improving and adapting our curriculum to prepare students for the supply chains of the future, and we recognize those supply chains will be even more globally complex. We are also developing a number of programs that will make global experiences almost a default expectation of students.",supply chain efficiency startup program

Supply chain efficiency is a zero-sum game. Every delay or even point of friction is cost that comes off your bottom line.

That cost is why supply chain management has become revolutionized. Almost every aspect has become much more predictable by leveraging precision control and insights.

However, there are a few aspects of the supply chain that have not been optimized to meet twenty-first-century management principles. Of these, forklift power management is one of the most overlooked, despite being slow, manual, unpredictable, and costly.

During nearly two decades of doing power assessments for GuaranteedPOWER® systems for 200+ contracts, we’ve identified that most forklift power management processes cost 30% percent more than they should.

GuaranteedPOWER® transforms your forklift (motive) power management and aligns it fully with your supply chain strategy.

The effect of supply chain visibility systems on business ...,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/107508,Автор: A Stanchik,"Abstract

As supply chains become more global and complex, it increases the importance of end-to-end visibility into the material, information, and financial flows of a firm. This work covers various aspects of supply chain visibility such as current status, its benefits, and the benefit-enabling mechanisms, traced through multiple stages of research, including a survey, round- table, and detailed interviews. Specifically, we developed a multi-case study analysis of supply chain visibility solutions (SCVS) and analyzed its effect on key supply chain processes. A qualitative ""with and without SCVS"" framework was employed to understand the changes observed in key business processes at several companies that recently implemented SCVS. This was combined with a cross-case study analysis to evaluate the effect of SCVS on the efficiency and effectiveness dimensions of process performance. We found that SCVS has a direct positive effect on data management processes via benefit-enabling mechanisms such as automation, standardization, and better raw data. Key operational processes, such as shipment and inventory management, risk management, and procurement and partner collaboration, were affected positively by SCVS via the antecedent data management process. The strength of impact of SCVS on key operational processes varies by company characteristics and the stage of implementation of SCVS. This research is most useful to companies considering implementing an SCVS to understand the potential benefits of SCVS and the underlying mechanisms. Managers can increase the relevance and robustness of results by extending the case-study analysis to include more companies with similar operating characteristics.",supply chain efficiency startup program
20 Important Supply Chain Terms That You Should Know ...,https://www.zoho.com/inventory/articles/20-important-scm-terms.html,N/A,"Reading Time: 5 minutes

The term ”supply chain” may sound complex, but it just means a system that allows a manufactured product to reach a consumer in one or more steps. A typical supply chain network for a product will consist of a raw materials supplier, a manufacturer, a distributor, a retailer, and a consumer. Depending on who you are and where you are in the chain, you will mostly likely have an upstream (your suppliers, which could be production lines or simply the people you purchase from) and a downstream (your consumers, who are the people you sell to or your disposal mechanisms).

To build an efficient business supply chain, it’s important that you familiarize yourself with the following concepts:

Back Ordering: A practice of placing a purchase order to a supplier for a product that’s temporarily out of stock in your warehouse and has already been ordered by your customers. Back ordering is usually adopted during times of high demand and for slow-moving products that suddenly see a spike in demand.

A practice of placing a purchase order to a supplier for a product that’s temporarily out of stock in your warehouse and has already been ordered by your customers. Back ordering is usually adopted during times of high demand and for slow-moving products that suddenly see a spike in demand. Bill of Lading: A shipping document showing the type of goods, their quantity, and the destination address. It is required whenever goods are transported from one point to another, whether you ship them by land, sea or air. This document also acts as a legal receipt of payment and has to be signed by all parties who are involved in the shipment: the seller/shipper, the carrier, and the buyer/receiver (when the goods reach them).

This document also acts as a legal receipt of payment and has to be signed by all parties who are involved in the shipment: the seller/shipper, the carrier, and the buyer/receiver (when the goods reach them). Blanket Order: A method in which the buyer will agree to buy a certain quantity of one or more items over an agreed-upon period of time (which can range from a few days to several months) without specifying their exact shipment dates at the time of purchase. The vendor can ship the goods in parts and on any convenient dates within this period. This is usually done when the buyer expects an increase in demand for certain products and would like to get a discount for making a larger purchase without locking up all of their capital.

Bonded Warehouse: A location managed by the customs office or a government body, where you may store taxable goods and imports subject to duties for business purposes. You only need to pay taxes at the time of removing the goods from the warehouse. This is particularly useful for retailers who import a lot of goods into the country, since it allows them to spread out their tax burden by deferring some tax payments to a later time.

Carnet: A legal document that will allow you to temporarily export items to another country and then reimport them back into the US within a year without paying import duties. This document is accepted in more than 80 countries and covers most items except consumables (such as food, oils, etc.), agricultural products, mail, explosives and disposables (anything that will be discarded following an export and will not be imported back).

Consignment: This term has more than one meaning. Most often it means the act of placing your goods in the care of a third-party warehouse owner (known as the consignee) who maintains them for a fee. In addition to storing the goods, the consignee may sell or ship them to customers on your behalf for a fee. As a separate meaning, consignments can also refer to individual shipments made to the consignee.

Cross docking: A method by which a business owner can ship goods that they have received from vendors to their customers with little to no storage time. This method typically uses a single dock or a platform that has the best access to both cargo loading and unloading areas, so that the goods unloaded from one set of truck can be reviewed, sorted, split into groups based on different destinations, and then loaded into another set of trucks for delivery. This method is typically used for perishable goods with a short shelf life and goods that are affected by temperature.

Drop shipment: A situation where one of your vendors ships goods directly to your customers, on your behalf. Here, the customer will not know your vendor and will be making all payments to you, while you will be paying your vendor and still making a profit. This is useful for selling slow-moving items with a long product life, without bearing the burden of storage and maintenance yourself.

EDI: Electronic Data Interface is a method of transferring transactions from one computer system to another, by converting the data into a standard that can be easily read by all systems. It is generally used in places where the exchange of information between two or more parties happens on paper. It could be used in cases where printed copies of invoices or orders are sent by a seller to a third party logistics provider for fulfilment.

FIFO: First in, first out is a method of cost lot tracking where items are valued and sold in the order they were purchased. To better understand this, let’s use an example. Gerald buys 100 apples on Monday at $1 each and another 50 apples on Tuesday for $1.5 each. He sets his selling price at $3 per apple and sells 120 apples on Thursday. Now, according to FIFO, 100 apples out of 120 is taken from the older stock and has a value of $1 x 100 = $100 and the other 20 apples came from the next batch, valued at $1.5 x 20 = $30. The profit/loss will then be calculated as: Profit made from selling 120 apples = Sales value – purchase value = (120 apples x $3) – ($100 + $30) = $360 – $130 = $230/-

First in, first out is a method of cost lot tracking where items are valued and sold in the order they were purchased. Groupage: This is a method of grouping multiple shipments from different sellers (each with its own bill of lading) inside a single container. This is done when individual shipments are less than the container load or in other words are not big enough by themselves to fill up an entire container. This way, the freight cost is split between these sellers.

PADAG: ”Please authorize my delivery against guarantee” is a document that mainly applies to consignments where a consignee is unable to produce relevant shipping documents (such as the bill of lading) to the shipper. The shipper instead receives a personal or bank guarantee from the consignee in exchange for releasing the goods in their custody.

Supply Chain Competition: A Market Game Approach

Presenter

Location

Building: UWBB

Room: 240

Abstract

We study supply chains where multiple suppliers sell to multiple retailers through a wholesale market. In practice, we often observe that both suppliers and retailers tend to influence the wholesale market price retailers pay to suppliers. However, existing models of supply chain competition do not capture retailers’ influence on the wholesale price (i.e., buyer power), and show that the wholesale price and the order quantity per retailer do not change with the number of retailers. To overcome this limitation, we develop a competition model based on the market-game mechanism in which the wholesale price is determined based on both suppliers’ and retailers’ decisions. When taking into account retailers’ buyer power, we obtain the result that is consistent with the observed practice: as the number of retailers increases, each retailer’s buyer power decreases, and each retailer is willing to pay more for her order, so the wholesale price increases. In this case, supply chain expansion to include more retailers (or suppliers) turns out to be more beneficial in terms of supply chain efficiency than what the prior literature shows without considering buyer power. Finally, we analyze the integration of two local supply chains, and show that, although the profit of the integrated supply chain is greater than the sum of total profits of local supply chains, integration may reduce the total profit of firms in a retailer-oriented supply chain that has more retailers than suppliers.

13th Annual Supply Chain Forum | News,https://gatton.uky.edu/about-us/stay-connected/news/2023/13th-annual-supply-chain-forum-0,N/A,"The 13th annual Supply Chain Forum, “Driving Supply Chain Performance with Data Science and Digitalization,” brought over 160 attendees to share and engage with supply chain students and professionals.

Hosted by the Don and Cathy Jacobs Executive Education Center, the event brought together national-caliber supply chain leaders who are practitioners, academics, and consultants. Businesses at different stages in their data science and digitalization journeys shared successes and lessons learned as they transformed their Supply Chains and engaged with UK MBA and Master of Science in Supply Chain Management (MSSCM) candidates and recent graduates.

The associate director of Supply Chain Outreach and Corporate Engagement, Carol Chavez shared, “We elevated the forum this year with a longer program and outstanding contributors. Covid-19 changed the supply chain profession profoundly. Our presenters and panelists addressed the many ways data science and digitalization can empower supply chain transformation. Sometimes learning what you do not know is as important as executing what you know well. As always, the best outcomes of the forum are the connections made between industry leaders and our MBA and MS SCM candidates.”

The forum included the presentation of the eighth annual Commonwealth Supply Chain Innovation Award to Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky (TMMK). “We selected TMMK for the award this year, not just for their innovative delivery frequency planning initiative supported by MS SCM candidates, but also for their extensive engagement with the MS SCM program and the University of Kentucky’s Lean Systems program. TMMK develops innovative leaders through these programs, supply chain leaders that may never work a day for Toyota,” said Chavez.

Without comparing inventory levels to the Rate of Sale, it would be impossible to respond to this question (ROS).

You can compare inventory levels across different sorts of merchandise using WOS. A merchant might stock thousands of units of a fast-moving product like socks, for example. However, for a slower-moving item like outerwear, they may just have a few tons of pieces on hand. WOS, for example, is a defined KPI that can be applied across all product categories.",supply chain efficiency startup program

BQUA 7825 Introduction to Supply Chain Management (Core)

Firms in many industries are scrambling to develop innovative ways to move products from raw materials through manufacturing to customers more quickly and efficiently. This course examines many of the recent innovations in this area. Through this course students will (a) recognize salient strategic challenges and opportunities for managing supply chains; (b) learn to use several basic analytical tools to assess performance tradeoffs and support decision making; (c) become familiar with the core supply chain concepts and strategies that have been adopted by leading companies and (d) review emerging supply chain strategies facilitated by Internet technology.

BQUA 7845 Logistics and Operations in Supply Chain (Core)

This course is about logistics: the design, planning and quality control of supply chains in business. Supply chains extend from raw material suppliers through production to the consumer. They bring food from the countryside to shops and supermarkets, convey raw materials to construction sites, and deliver manufactured goods to retail outlets where people can buy them. Without this movement, the economy would collapse. In fact, the amount of goods movement is itself a barometer of prosperity, rising during times of economic growth and falling during times of depression. Managing logistics is a demanding task, which requires a mixture of skills. The problems can be mathematically very challenging. This course is largely concerned with the principles that can be applied to analyze situations and seek out optimal solutions in the realm of logistics in supply chain management. However, we shall also review the way logistical systems operate in practice, so that the methods can be understood in context.

BITM 7732: Enterprise Resource Planning Systems (Elective)

This course provides a foundation for understanding the process integration of business-wide functions supported by Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, examines the benefits of implementing ERP, investigates the guidelines for ERP system implementation and application, and introduces SAP to illustrate the basic concepts, capabilities, and advantages of ERP.

BSAN 7001: Introduction to Data Analytics and Business Intelligence (Elective)

Business decision-making should, when possible, rely on data and the conclusions that can be drawn from that data. This course is an introduction to business data analytics; it covers descriptive statistics, data visualization, probability basics, and relationships between two or more variables. One focus is on learning and contrasting traditional statistical approaches (inference) and ""big data"" approaches. Much of the course will entail the use of Excel, as spreadsheet software is arguably the most commonly available and most frequently used tool for analyzing business data. We will equally be using R – a popular, open-source, statistical package.

BSAN 7054: Project Management (Elective)

Indeed, on the one hand, the environmental performance has become a factor of competitiveness for companies and an important purchasing criterion for customers whether in the context of B-to-B or B-to-C.

On the other hand, the environmental performance depends on the decisions undertaken at the design of SC such as location/allocation of production sites, choice of suppliers, selection of manufacturing technologies and transportation modes, etc…

A study on the Brazilian food companies in the Covid-19 era,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36687333/,Автор: ZF Ardekani,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought negative impacts to global supply chains, in particular to the agricultural sector. Although these companies have been developing programs to mitigate the impacts caused by COVID-19, researchers have been worried about a possible weakening of the adoption of sustainable initiatives due to a focus on dealing with the consequences of the pandemic. Grounded on the Resource Orchestration Theory, the goal of this study was to assess the effects of the COVID-19 outbreak on sustainable (environmental, social, and economic) performance in the context of agri-food supply chains. To do so, a questionnaire survey was used to collect data from 349 different medium and large agri-food companies in Brazil. Data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Squares technique. This study has found out that, under the impacts arising from COVID-19 pandemic (1) supply management and transportation and logistics management had a positive impact on food supply chains' sustainable performance; (2) the effects of relationship management and supply chain wide impact management were found to be negative on sustainable performance; and (3) the effects of demand and production management on sustainable performance were not considered significant. We propose a framework that clearly represents the relationship between the disrupted supply chain areas and sustainable performance through the development of orchestration capabilities. By knowing which kinds of impacts produce the most significant effects on sustainable performance, policy makers and managers will be able to make decisions and take actions to avoid negative effects and to improve firms' sustainable performance.",supply chain efficiency startup program

Supply Chain Digital Transformation: How Does It Add ...,https://appinventiv.com/blog/digital-transformation-in-supply-chain-management/,N/A,"COVID-19 has hit hard upon all aspects of businesses, including supply chains. There has been a significant disruption in the supply chain sector due to the global lockdown, requiring market leaders to revamp their operations strategy and embrace supply chain digital transformation to prevent future disruptions as we enter the new normal after COVID-19.

It is why businesses across industries are adopting advanced technologies – from blockchain and intelligent automation to artificial intelligence and machine learning – which have proven to be the support system for all SMBs across the globe.

Technologies like embedded sensors, GPS, and RFID have helped companies transform their existing traditional (a mix of paper-based and IT-supported processes) supply chain structures into more agile, flexible, open, and collaborative digital models.

Digital transformation in supply chain management enables organizational flexibility and business process automation and accelerates innovation in supply chain management. To take maximum advantage of digitized supply chain models, it is important that companies make it an integral part of the overall business model and organizational structure.

Let’s take a quick look at some digital supply chain transformation stats:

In a Mckinsey survey of supply chain executives, 93 % reported that they are planning to take steps to make their supply chains more resilient, “including nearshoring and regionalizing their supply chains.”

According to insights from Gartner , bringing digital transformation into the supply chain can lead to a 20% increase in revenue and a 50% reduction in process costs.

O ver the next decade, machine consumer demand will become increasingly relevant, creating more than 20% of revenue.

CSCOs (Chief Supply Chain Officers) anticipate double-digit growth in machine orders by 2030.

More than 60% of supply chains are planning to align strategy and build the capability to design machine response strategy over the next three years.

Considering these supply chain digitalization statistics, CSCOs must revolutionize their operations to keep pace with the increasing acceleration of machine orders and accelerate digital supply chains.

There’s no denying that organizations are willing to digitize their supply chain management to improve agility, efficiency, and visibility. On that note, let’s dive into digital supply chain management’s meaning and understand how it differs from a traditional supply chain.

[Also read “How to recession proof your business using digital transformation solutions.”]

Supply Chain Digital Transformation Examples:

Walmart’s recent digital supply chain risk management strategy has enabled the industry giant to provide customers with more accurate information about the shipping and delivery of their orders — a long-awaited feature that was initially accessible for items bought directly from the store only.

Furthermore, the automated tracking system ensures that the customers will stay informed about every stage and the status of their order until it is delivered. By experiencing digital transformation in logistics and supply chains, customers will feel more elevated and engaged throughout their buying journey. This gives customers an improved experience and greater satisfaction with their purchases.

Traditional vs. Digital Supply Chains

Traditional supply chains function on rules based on historical transactional inputs, while supply chains integrated with digital technologies function in real-time. While digital supply chains are networks, traditional supply chains are linear.

In digital supply chain management, information from IT and operational technology systems are integrated, while traditional supply chains often rely on standalone systems. Traditional supply chains require a lot of legwork when it comes to spotting possible problems and predicting likely risks. In such situations, an IT consulting company has a great role to play.

In contrast, with supply chain digital transformation, shared quality and control data can enable companies to anticipate issues and take immediate precautionary measures. Above all, in digital supply chains, machines drive the decisions with human oversight, while in traditional supply chains, humans make decisions based on machine inputs.

Why Does Digital Transformation Matter In Supply Chain Management?

Digitization in supply chain management empowers your planning, sourcing, and logistics teams to collaborate, automate and effectively leverage analytics. It has also proven to drive growth, mitigate risk, and optimize costs.

Here are a few other benefits of supply chain digital transformation, so let’s dive in!

Organizational Flexibility: With a digital operating model, management has greater freedom to choose the appropriate degree of centralization needed to support specialization or minimize process costs, given different local labor costs and productivity levels across locations. A significant benefit for an organization when it centralizes certain specific functions is higher value through better quality and productivity. Better Decision Making: Once your supply chain is integrated with digital technologies, you will make faster and more informed decisions for each specific function. Also, you can measure performance accurately and efficiently by aggregating transactions and available information at the macro level, making appropriate decisions to avoid distortions from average costing.

For instance, BASF, a German multinational chemical corporation, uses AI and machine learning-based technologies to accurately predict when the product stock is running low and the optimal time to replenish supply and minimize disruptions. This has led to increased visibility into inventory levels, which supports smarter replenishment planning, more efficient decision-making, and, ultimately, better customer service. The recent tech development in digital twin technology for businesses has also brought a model-driven decision-making approach into the picture for sustainability and feasibility.

Increases Automation: An end-to-end digital platform creates efficiency, improves data accuracy, and increases supply chain efficiency by automating many labor-extensive processes and facilitating decision-making at multiple stages in the lifecycle. Automation also determines the most appropriate shipping mode, carrier, and schedule while considering time, speed, priority, and other elements.

For instance, alerts are generated automatically when purchase orders are in danger of delays or complications. This helps companies to take precautionary measures and be better prepared to handle customers.

Accelerates Innovation: All digital transformation processes are aimed towards a single goal – innovation. This improvement over the conventional way of supply chain management will help strengthen the company’s business model and, at the same time, help build relationships with suppliers and customers. End-to-End Customer engagement: Digital transformation in supply chain management will increase customer engagement in his journey. For example, after placing an order, a customer will stay updated with his order details until receiving it with the help of the supplier’s automated tracking system. This will ensure that customers have more control, feel more secure, and appreciate their experience when buying that brand.

Farmer Connect is a company that uses technologies like Blockchain to connect coffee growers with the consumers they serve. They have launched a mobile application, ‘Thank My Farmer,’ that allows coffee lovers to trace the quality and origin of their coffee and even support the farmer who grew the beans. The app connects the user to farmers, traders, roasters, and brands.

Top Tech Trends In Supply Chain Digital Transformation

Let’s get started with the different supply chain trends you must optimize in 2023 and beyond to improve your organization’s overall productivity and performance.

1. eCommerce Integration: Modern-day technology in supply chain management allows B2B sellers to identify and resolve any inefficiencies within their supply chain models.

Connected systems make it possible for them to offer seamless customer experiences and run efficient operations. Thus, companies are starting to utilize the benefits of interconnected supply chains for their eCommerce operations, enabling a free flow of information across departments.

2. Cloud Computing: The ever-rising demand for cloud computing is also an emerging tech practice that has helped accelerate supply chain digitization. Now, companies store the data on local servers instead of storing it on the cloud for easier and faster accessibility. In straight term, with cloud computing adoption in the supply chain, companies can easily access the needed information and share them with other companies or stakeholders anywhere, anytime.

3. Artificial intelligence: Artificial intelligence (AI) in the supply chain consists of a toolbox of technology options that help companies understand complex content, enhance human performance, and take over routine tasks.

AI and analytics help supply chain leaders solve long-standing data silos and governance challenges. Its capabilities allow for more integration and visibility across networks of previously remote or disparate stakeholders.

4. Internet of Things (IoT): IoT is a network of physical objects connected to the internet. The IoT already plays a significant role in the supply chain, but it will likely continue to grow in importance with increasingly diverse applications. In just a few years, 50% of companies could use other advanced technologies to support supply chain operations.

IoT in manufacturing and supply chains can also be used to improve warehouse management, fleet tracking, inventory control, and even technological and mechanical maintenance. It could even be used to create entirely smart warehouses and fleets, increasing efficiency.

5. Blockchain: Blockchain has been incredibly beneficial for businesses to minimize supply chain disruption and improve customer service. By 2024, global spending on blockchain solutions is projected to reach almost $19 billion. Over the past few years, this technology trend has integrated different business streams, such as carriers, shipping lines, and logistic providers, into a single platform.

Blockchain also allows logistics business operations to process data by cutting out waste efficiently. The transparency offered by blockchain technology helps identify issues even before they occur.

6. Supply Chain Digital Twins: It is a virtual representation of the supply chain that consists of hundreds of warehouses, inventory, assets, and logistics positions. The digital twin simulates the supply chain’s performance using AI and advanced analytics, including all the complexities that drive risks and vulnerabilities. A digital twin also increases visibility and helps your workforce to take advantage of opportunities, particularly in complex supply chains.

Five Steps To Digitizing Supply Chain

Moving from a traditional supply chain to a digital one is a complex process, but taking the first step is essential if you want to reap the maximum benefits of digitalization in supply chain management and logistics. Here are the steps that will help you prepare for digital transformation in supply chains.

1. Define a Vision: The first step for implementing digital transformation in the supply chain is to define a clear vision. Make sure that the vision is aligned with your enterprise goals. These goals can be related to your business objectives, such as better and faster decision-making, automated operations, and improved supply chain visibility.

Assess resources and existing systems: Identify what capabilities you’ll need to achieve your transformation goals and determine the gaps.

Legacy systems: Ensure that your existing systems use technology to support your new goals. Is the technology used by you aligned with your business objectives? Identify digital solutions and legacy systems to help achieve the desired business outcomes.

Data collection and analysis: Assess the capabilities of existing systems to generate, collect and analyze data . Check if the data can be accessed easily to draw actionable insights.

Workforce skills: Determine if your team has the required skills to work with and adapt to the new business model.

2. Unify Data and Processes: Use a unified platform to gain complete, end-to-end supply chain visibility. Utilize enhanced transparency for streamlining core functions, including inventory management, warehouse management, demand forecasting, and logistics. The main objective is to increase visibility for every role and process across the extended supply chain.

3. Automate the Planning Process: With automated planning, you can simplify tasks and derive meaning from large volumes of data. Replace routine or recurring tasks with automated processes. But do not automate processes that involve complex situations or require collaboration between planners.

4. Use Data and Analytics: Supply chain leaders need access to real-time data to make informed decisions. It also helps them deal effectively with partners, suppliers, and other related functions. Real-time data also helps identify potential disruptions and increases visibility across the supply chain.

Moreover, you can use AI-powered analytical tools to improve planning processes and draw actionable insights. For instance, using analytics, you can help prevent an out-of-stock situation and adjust inventory accordingly.

5. Align People with Processes: Even if you shift to a digital supply chain, it would be futile if your team members were not aligned with the new techniques and processes.

This shift should integrate technologies with processes, people, and management. Without such integration, teams may not be able to achieve the desired results in the new business model.

JD.com and Saudi Electricity Company Announce Strategic ...,https://jdcorporateblog.com/jd-com-and-saudi-electricity-company-announce-strategic-partnership-to-enhance-logistics-and-supply-chain-management/,7 дней назад,"JD.com, also known as Jingdong, was recently recognized in the Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 for 2024. This recognition highlights JD.com’s excellence and leadership in the global supply chain sector. As the only major online retailer from Asia on the list, JD.com joins industry leaders like Amazon, Apple, and Schneider Electric.

According to Gartner, the companies recognized on this year’s list embraced in three trends: attracting and engaging talent, AI-driven advances, and antifragile supply chains. JD.com’s inclusion on this list underscores its success in navigating complex challenges while delivering exceptional value to customers worldwide.

“The supply chain organizations in this year’s Top 25 were notable for better protecting growth rates in a challenging operating environment, while at the same time delivering more sustainable operations,” said Simon Bailey, VP Analyst with the Gartner Supply Chain practice. “The best supply chains now have ESG criteria firmly embedded in their operations, while delivering higher than average growth rates, better returns on physical assets (ROPA) and stronger margins.”

“We are honored to be recognized in the Gartner Supply Chain Top 25 for 2024 for our efforts in driving innovation in the global supply chain ecosystem,” said Hao Hu, Head of Supply Chain R&D at JD.com. “JD.com has developed cutting-edge technologies such as explainable forecasting, autonomous replenishment, and an intelligent carbon management platform to create a resilient, efficient, and sustainable supply chain that delivers value to customers worldwide.”

Significant investment in new technologies and infrastructure has enabled JD.com to continuously enhance its supply chain efficiency and agility, achieving an industry-leading 29-day turnover rate (in Q1 2024) while managing an extensive portfolio of over 10 million self-operated SKUs. Currently, JD.com boasts an automated procurement rate exceeding 85%, all while maintaining an average inventory availability of no less than 95%.

Advanced Technology for Resilient Supply Chains

In February, JD.com was awarded Gartner’s “Power of the Profession Supply Chain Awards for 2024” for its research in probabilistic forecasting and explainable AI technology. This technology has built a resilient planning system that delivers reliable decision-making despite unpredictable disruptions and rapid market changes. Integrating probabilistic forecasting with explainable AI significantly enhances supply chain agility and resiliency, especially during complex shopping scenarios like large-scale promotions and disruptions such as extreme weather conditions. This technology has boosted supply chain planning accuracy from 65% to 90%, reduced vendor lead times by 15%, and enabled JD to maintain a high service level.

Adopting GenAI for Industry-Specific Scenarios

JD.com’s advanced innovation in applying generative AI (GenAI) was also recognized by Gartner. The company launched a large language model (LLM), ChatRhino, for industry-specific applications. The model combines generalized data with JD’s proprietary intelligent supply chain data to address challenges in sectors like retail, logistics and finance. Businesses can utilize ChatRhino for commercial applications like intelligent customer service and AI marketing.

Global Footprint of Next-Gen Supply Chain

JD.com continues to expand its global footprint by replicating elements of its world-class logistics and supply chain solutions from China to address supply chain challenges in Europe, North America, the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and more. JD Logistics’ overseas warehousing operations already offer same-day fulfillment services in key European markets and rapid two-to-three-day delivery across 90% of regions in the United States. Recently, JD Logistics announced a significant expansion of its express delivery service, enhancing the international express delivery experience from China to 23 global destinations.

Intelligent Carbon Management Platform for Sustainable Supply Chain

On May 13, FORTUNE China announced its “China ESG Impact List 2024,” marking JD.com’s third consecutive appearance for its exceptional performance in environmental, social, and governance (ESG). Last year, JD Logistics introduced the Supply Chain Emission Management Platform (SCEMP), a groundbreaking platform for managing the carbon footprint of logistics transportation. SCEMP accurately calculates carbon emissions based on the actual routes of transportation vehicles. “Verified to encompass over 140 types of carbon emission factors for road transportation in China, SCEMP is the first of its kind in supply chain carbon management,” said Christiana Wang, a carbon reduction expert from JD Logistics.

About the Gartner Supply Chain Top 25

Supply Chain Top 25 ranking comprises two main components: business performance and community opinion. Business performance in the form of public financial and ESG (environmental, social, governance) data provides a view into how companies have performed in the past three years, while the community opinion component gives a peer and Gartner expert view to companies’ future potential and reflects leadership in the supply chain community. These two components are combined into a total composite score.

Gartner derives a list of companies from a combination of the Fortune Global 500 and the Forbes Global 2000. In an effort to maintain the list of companies evaluated at a manageable level, a general annual revenue threshold of $15 billion has been applied and companies without physical supply chains are excluded.

Coyote Logistics: enhancing supply chain efficiency,https://businesschief.com/leadership-and-strategy/coyote-logistics-enhancing-supply-chain-efficiency,N/A,"In a recent announcement made by Coyote Logistics - a leading global third party logistics (3PL) provider and subsidiary of UPS - has expanded its dynamic route optimisation program.

The new solution developed aims to reduce uncertainty, improve reliability and streamline operations across the supply chain. The program aims to achieve this by maximising the efficiency of fleets and delivering load consistency via optimised routing plans that direct drivers to and from locations taking into account driver hours, load attributes, market cost, mile per hour bands by region and home base city.

“Coyote has taken a customer-centric approach from day one. By listening to our network, understanding their complex challenges and building new solutions to combat them, we are able to support shippers and carriers in creative new ways,” commented Nick Shroeger, Chief Network Solutions Officer at Coyote. “Offering Dynamic Route Optimization is a perfect example. It helps drive efficiency to carrier networks and delivers clear benefits to all members of the supply chain, offering drivers confirmed rates and loads, while providing more dependability to shippers.”

Those harnessing the solution can benefit from the ability to strategically build fleets with the assurance of confirmed weekly rates and truckloads. As a result of optimising fleets via the solution, the program supports the reduction of carbon footprints by mitigating empty miles.

“Like all carriers, inconsistent load volume, rates and schedule gaps are significant sources of stress that are exacerbated by market volatility,” added Eric Lewis, VP of Operations at Ed Lewis Trucking. “Dynamic Route Optimization from Coyote has helped us remove uncertainty from our weekly operations by strategically stringing shipments together so we can keep our fleet full and moving, while providing our drivers the amount of miles per week they were promised.”

By harnessing input from each carrier, Coyote has the capability to manage the process end-to-end in order to make the experience simple and efficient. As well as reducing levels of uncertainty with confirmed rates and loads.

“We began using Dynamic Route Optimisation with Coyote before the COVID-19 pandemic struck. Despite being a time of disruption for the supply chain, it offered us the consistency and reliability we needed to combat market volatility and the stress drivers experience during economic uncertainty,” concluded Joey Riceputo, Vice President at FSR Trucking. “We were not only able to uphold all commitments we made prior to COVID-19 but have also continued to give our drivers regular routes even with the rise and fall in demand thanks to Coyote’s network density and unmatched service.”

In GSF, we are exploring the road towards emission free maritime transport. We do so by promoting the use of existing energy efficient technology, and by exploring the use of new (digital) technologies. We believe in collaboration as an enabler for a more sustainable maritime industry and facilitate innovation across maritime value chains.

GSF is

working towards emission free maritime transport.

ambitious in the exploration and use of new technologies

enabling innovation across maritime value chains

GSF is founded on a strong Danish heritage that builds on open collaboration and cooperation across all stakeholders in the Maritime Industry. Our projects and activities support our mission thematically and deal with a broad range of related topics from energy efficient ship design, over 3D print to digitization for de-carbonization. Over the years, we have built the GSF way of collaborating. When we develop projects with our members across the value chain, we do so with a very open mind and focus on the problems we want to solve, before discussing the business case.

We explore the road to emission free maritime transport and a more environmental and financial sustainable maritime industry, through three core areas:

1) Future fuels

2) Increased appliance of energy efficient technology (existing and new)

3) De-carbonization through digitization

GSF is an independent network for ship owners, OEMs, suppliers and classification societies, but also organizations and authorities as well as research- and educational institutions. GSF is financed and controlled by the members.

Furthermore Green Ship of the Future is

• A room for play and collaboration for the maritime industry

• A strong network of professionals with a special focus on green technology and innovation.

• A platform for the development and participation in cross-industry projects.

• Visibility, Inspiration and collaboration within the green technology agenda

International Collaboration and visibility

In GSF, we believe that sustainable development of the maritime industry is a global issue. For that reason, we regularly join forces or coordinate with similar initiatives such as International Windship Association, the Sustainable Shipping Initiative, Smart Green Shipping Alliance and Carbon War Room. Recently, we co-organized the COP23 conference Ambition 1.5: Global Shipping’s Action Plan with more than 150 delegates from 25 countries.

History (pre re-establishment in August 2015)

The GSF initiative was initially founded in 2008 by the four leading Danish maritime companies Aalborg Industries, A.P. Moller-Maersk, MAN Diesel and Odense Steel Shipyard together with the Danish Maritime Authority in recognition of the ecological responsibility nested in the maritime industry.

The GSF, initially, set ambitious goals for emission reductions through collaboration within the Blue Denmark. After 4 years, the members could look back at successful projects and a strong professional network. Once the original goals had been achieved, however, the activity level went down and forces were united to create the 16 mill. EURO Blue INNOship project addressing societal challenges in relation to the environment and energy efficiency. The Blue INNOship project embraces around 40 partners from industry and universities etc. and the goal is development of commercial products and services.

After Blue INNOship, it became clear, that there continues to be a high level of project activity and creativity within the industry and accordingly a need for encouragement and coordination of new green project initiatives. Accordingly, in April 2015 the partners within Green Ship of the Future decided to revive the partnership.

With their different backgrounds, Blue INNOship and Green Ship of the Future are now complimentary initiatives, co-operating to support a greening of the Blue Denmark.",freight technology R&D cooperation

Strategies for Sustainable Freight Transport,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-658-37103-6_4,Автор: S Pfoser,"Improve strategies aim to increase the eco-efficiency of (mostly road) vehicles and fleets (Mauch et al., 2001). The increase in eco-efficiency is enabled by a number of clean technologies, for example low rolling-resistance tires, lightweight design (e.g. aluminum wheels) or truck platooning (Punte et al., 2019). Particular potential for eco-efficiency lies also in the development of alternative fuels and propulsion systems. In the recent decades, several alternative fuel technologies have emerged including hydrogen, biofuels, electric and natural gas vehicles. In the area of medium and heavy truck transport, natural gas is the alternative which in the short-term is considered to be the best substitute for conventional fuels since it comprises the potential to reduce environmental impacts and it is readily available and accessible (Yeh, 2007). LNG, i.e. natural gas in its liquid state, is the only alternative fuel which is well suited for heavy trucks of more than 18 metric tons (Table 4.1).

Table 4.1 Application range of different alternative fuel technologies. (based on Feldpausch-Jaegers et al., 2016) Full size table

The energy density of LNG is very high compared to other fuels. To convert natural gas to LNG, it has to be cooled down to a temperature of −162 °C where it becomes liquid and reduces its volume roughly 600 times (Arteconi et al., 2010). Due to this volume reduction, the energy density of LNG is much higher than, for example, of CNG (compressed natural gas), which is the reason why LNG can conveniently be used for heavy-duty and long distance transport, while CNG is rather used for passenger transport. The maximum driving range of LNG trucks is currently 1600 kilometers, while the maximum driving range of CNG vehicles is only 500 kilometers (Anderhofstadt and Spinler, 2019). The driving range of electric vehicles is even less, namely only up to 200 kilometers. This restricts the application areas of electric vehicles to urban logistics with short-distance transports and light vehicles (Anderhofstadt and Spinler, 2019). Further barriers for electric trucks consist in the high weight of battery packs which reduces the payload; and the recharging time, which is significantly longer and requires more energy for electric trucks than for electric cars (Engerer and Horn, 2010). Another type of alternative fuels is biofuel, e.g. bioethanol or biodiesel. Biofuels are gaseous or liquid fuels generated from biomass such as plant or animal waste (Kluschke et al., 2019). The main problem with biofuels is their limited availability which occurs because land use is primarily dedicated for food production (Duarte et al., 2014; Simio et al., 2013).

Due to the above described shortages of existing alternative fuel technologies, several truck manufacturers like Iveco and Scania currently focus on the development of LNG fueled trucks. Pioneering fleet owners have already started to purchase these LNG trucks. In summer 2018, the German Federal Ministry of Transport started a funding program to subsidize energy-efficient heavy-duty vehicles producing low CO 2 emissions. Statistics from October 2019 reveal that out of 1390 funding requests, 994 trucks were LNG-fueled, 339 trucks were CNG-fueled and only 57 trucks were electric (Völklein, 2019). Later on in February 2020, in total 1915 funding requests were submitted to the German Federal Ministry of Transport, out of which a high number of 1500 requests encompass LNG-fueled trucks, despite the fact that at that time the toll exemptions for LNG trucks were expected to expire at the end of 2019 (Landwehr, 2020).

In the long run, hydrogen is considered a highly promising alternative fuel technology by many experts (Table 4.2). Hydrogen trucks have an on-board hydrogen storage to generate electricity within a fuel cell (Kluschke et al., 2019). Prospects for the introduction of hydrogen as a transport fuel already started in the 1970s and tended to be too optimistic throughout the last decades, with early forecasts predicting an important role for hydrogen as transport fuel by 2010 or even much earlier (Moriarty and Honnery, 2019). Hydrogen vehicles could significantly reduce GHG from transport, but the production of hydrogen is very costly and needs further research and development (Durbin and Malardier-Jugroot, 2013). There are still many unresolved questions regarding the production, distribution and storage of hydrogen (Gondal and Sahir, 2012). Passenger cars running on hydrogen are already commercially available in Germany and Austria, but hydrogen trucks are still in their prototype stage (Anderhofstadt and Spinler, 2019). Notably, it is predicted that hydrogen will predominantly be important for freight transport and not so much for passenger transport (Moriarty and Honnery, 2019). Already in the early 2000s it was recommended that the ecological benefits and cost efficiency would be higher if hydrogen was introduced for freight transport (Farrell et al., 2003). The reason is that freight transport entails “a small number of relatively large vehicles that are operated by professional crews along a limited number of point-to-point routes or within a small geographic area” (Farrell et al., 2003, p. 1357). Furthermore, heavy-duty vehicles are produced to order and each vehicle receives considerable engineering attention, which facilitates technological innovation (as compared to passengers cars which are manufactured in large quantities on assembly lines) (Farrell et al., 2003).

Table 4.2 Impact and timeframe of alternative fuels for road freight transport. (based on Punte et al., 2019) Full size table

The impact of LNG is estimated to be rather low and short-term according to Table 4.2. Apparently, conventional natural gas is still a fossil fuel and therefore not suitable to comply with the 2050 zero emission logistics targets of the European Union (Punte et al., 2019). Despite that, LNG can play an important role along the way to zero emission logistics in several respects. On the one hand, natural gas is considered to be a bridge fuel in the transition process from oil and coal to a (near-)zero emission energy system (Zhang et al., 2016). Though natural gas is fossil, it is the cleanest burning fossil fuel. The combustion of LNG causes nearly 99% less particulate matter (PM) and sulfur oxide (SO x ) emissions, around 80% less nitrogen oxides (NO x ) and around 20% less carbon dioxide compared to diesel (Kumar et al., 2011). Vehicles fueled with LNG also produce lower noise levels, which allows them to enter zones with driving bans, like specific inner cities or making deliveries at night time (Peters-von Rosenstiel et al., 2015). And most importantly, the LNG technology is already available and ready to use, as opposed to hydrogen. The first use of natural gas vehicles dates back to the 1930s, and today there is a wide range of natural gas vehicles available (Osorio-Tejada et al., 2015; Yeh, 2007). Using LNG trucks could be a first step to reduce emissions from freight transport until zero emission fuel cell trucks are mature and ready for the market. Recent literature also suggests that there are synergies between natural gas and hydrogen technology in a way that natural gas infrastructure could help enable a transition to the long-term application of hydrogen in transportation (Ogden et al., 2018). The synergies result from the fact that natural gas and hydrogen share some physical similarities (both can be stored as compressed gases or cryogenic liquids) and they use similar infrastructural components (such as compressors, storage tanks and pipelines) (Ogden et al., 2018). It is therefore being discussed whether natural gas infrastructure can be re-used or designed for compatibility with the emerging hydrogen technology to promote the introduction of hydrogen. For example, the existing natural gas pipeline network could be used to distribute hydrogen initially. Blending hydrogen and natural gas is technically possible up to a mix of 17% hydrogen (Gondal and Sahir, 2012). This way, the use of natural gas (and LNG) at present can promote the future deployment of zero emission fuels like hydrogen.

On the other hand, the environmental impact of LNG can be further improved if bio-methane from renewable sources is used to produce LNG. LNG made from bio-methane is then referred to as “renewable LNG” (r-LNG) or “bio-LNG”. Fossil methane and bio-methane can be mixed to produce LNG. LNG purely made from bio-methane has the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions between 43–67% (depending on the engine technology) as compared to diesel vehicles (Alamia et al., 2016). Shell even announced that they are going to construct a liquefaction plant in Germany which enables them to provide CO 2 -neutral bio-LNG in the upcoming years (Reichel, 2020). For the distribution of bio-methane the same infrastructure and networks as for LNG and CNG can be used. The risk associated with the introduction of bio-methane as alternative fuel is therefore expected to be limited (Thrän et al., 2014). The production costs of renewable LNG are relatively high at the moment compared to the production costs of fossil LNG or diesel (Scheitrum et al., 2017). However, it is estimated that bio-methane will become more widely available in the upcoming years due to advancements in biomass gasification technologies and integration with the distribution networks of LNG and CNG (Alamia et al., 2016). Therefore, the use of LNG trucks could serve as a transitional solution until the large-scale production of bio-methane is possible at competitive price in the coming years (Osorio-Tejada et al., 2017).

The above discussions show that LNG is currently the only viable alternative for heavy-duty vehicles and long-haul transportation. In some European countries, LNG is already a fully accepted technology. For example, the development stage of LNG as transport fuel in Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom is estimated to be between demonstration and early market (Osorio-Tejada et al., 2017). Nevertheless, in countries like Germany and Austria, the use of LNG is rather moderate and demand is fairly low except for some first pioneer users (Anderhofstadt and Spinler, 2019). It is therefore necessary to learn the reasons which cause the hesitation of the fleet owners and find measures to encourage the widespread adoption of LNG.",freight technology R&D cooperation

Today's meeting in the General Affairs and External Relations Council covered a large number of issues. However, one recurring topic was Afghanistan, which was discussed in different groupings of ministers for foreign affairs, defence and development cooperation, and also with the NATO Secretary-General and the UN Special Representative to Afghanistan.

EU to continue anti-piracy operation off Somali coast

The defence and foreign ministers together discussed the EU's Operation Atalanta off the Somali coast. Atalanta helps to protect ships from the UN World Food Programme and civilian vessels. The Member States agreed that the operation should continue in 2010.

The ministers also discussed Bosnia and Herzegovina and the EU's Operation Althea. The future of Operation Althea and the continued military presence in the area were on the agenda. The ministers discussed the requirements for a transition to a non-executive military mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Common goals for EU security and defence policy

In addition, the Council adopted conclusions on what has been achieved within the European Security and Defence Policy during the Swedish Presidency and a declaration on future developments.

EU coordination for more effective crisis management

The defence ministers received a report on the European Defence Agency, EDA. The EDA supports the Member States in the work on the European Security and Defence Policy, first and foremost by promoting collaboration projects. The work of the EDA is to strengthen the EU's defence capacity, in particular crisis management, to promote research and technology development and to increase EU cooperation in the area of defence equipment.

Increased cooperation on maritime surveillance

The defence ministers also discussed the question of increased cooperation on maritime surveillance. This includes exchanging information and recognised maritime pictures in order to better be able to deal with events at sea. Maritime surveillance is necessary for sea rescue, fisheries controls and border controls, but also for monitoring freight shipping and combating oil spills. The Member States are to draw up a plan of how cooperation can be developed.

Ministers prepare for EU- Ukraine summit

The foreign ministers discussed Ukraine, with a focus on energy, the political and financial situation in Ukraine and relations between the EU and Ukraine. Ukraine's financial situation is a cause for concern and there is a risk of a new gas crisis during the winter. On 4 December an EU-Ukraine summit will be held in Kiev and on 17 January 2010 Ukraine will hold presidential elections.

EU concerned over humanitarian situation in Gaza

The Middle East peace process was also on the agenda. The ministers discussed how the EU can support the American efforts to breathe new life into the peace process. The EU is concerned over the serious humanitarian situation in Gaza and the tense situation in eastern Jerusalem. In a statement the EU called for concrete measures to resolve the humanitarian situation in Gaza and to facilitate reconstruction and economic recovery.

Continued sanctions against Belarus

The EU sanctions against Belarus were reviewed at the Council meeting and the foreign ministers agreed conclusions. The sanctions remain in place because Belarus has not made the progress that the EU expects, in areas including human and democratic rights. On the other hand, the EU retains the eased travel restrictions for certain officials that had previously been introduced. The EU is continuing its involvement in Belarus to try to influence development. In the Council conclusions from the meeting, the EU welcomes political dialogue with Belarus and also Belarus's participation in the Eastern Partnership. Dialogue provides an opportunity for mutual understanding and a chance to discuss different misgivings.

Ministers discuss Afghanistan

The ministers had a number of discussions on Afghanistan in different groups, with NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and UN Special Representative to Afghanistan Kai Eide. A few weeks ago the EU adopted a strategy to strengthen EU action in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to make it more effective. Afghanistan is facing critical challenges and the country requires strong and credible institutions. The Council today adopted conclusions on democracy building in EU external relations. Against this background, the ministers for foreign affairs and development cooperation, together with Kai Eide, discussed democracy support to Afghanistan. The discussion focused on how the EU can coordinate and streamline its support.

Moving Forward to 2030

The CAREC Program has made tangible progress in moving toward its goal of development through cooperation over its first 16 years. Despite many challenges, CAREC has established itself as a premier regional cooperation program anchored in a clear vision of “Good Neighbors, Good Partners, and Good Prospects.”

As of December 2023, 272 CAREC-related projects worth more than $51 billion have been implemented in the areas of transport, trade, energy and economic corridors development, allowing better connectivity and easier movement of people and freight throughout the region, enhancing energy efficiency and security, increasing trade, and improving the quality of life for all.

In the course of CAREC’s evolution, many important lessons have been learned, and new development challenges have emerged as a result of the unexpected and significant changes in the international economic environment. In 2016, the Midterm Review of CAREC 2020 (MTR CAREC 2020), noted the need to revisit and adjust the Program’s strategic framework to ensure its relevance in the fast-changing landscape of member countries in the region.

CAREC 2030: Connecting the Region for Shared and Sustainable Development

At the 16th Ministerial Conference on CAREC in 2017, ministers endorsed CAREC 2030: Connecting the Region for Shared and Sustainable Development (CAREC 2030), the new strategic framework that will guide the Program over the next 13 years. CAREC 2030 builds on the solid foundation of progress made under CAREC 2020, while updating its strategic directions to respond more efficiently to the region’s long-term development challenges.

CAREC 2030 is inspired by a mission to create an open and inclusive regional cooperation platform that connects people, policies and projects for shared and sustainable development.

Driving Principles of CAREC 2030

CAREC 2030 is guided by the following five driving principles:

Aligning with national strategies and supporting the new international development agenda , embodied in the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21);

, embodied in the sustainable development goals (SDGs) and the 21st Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP21); Adopting a dual-track approach by deepening cooperation in the traditional areas of transport, energy, trade, and economic corridor development, while selectively expanding into new areas of cooperation in line with member countries’ priorities;

of transport, energy, trade, and economic corridor development, while in line with member countries’ priorities; Deepening policy dialogue based on CAREC’s standing and ability to deliver quality knowledge services;

based on CAREC’s standing and ability to deliver quality knowledge services; Integrating the role of the private sector and civil society by promoting people-to-people and business-to-business contacts across member countries; and

by promoting people-to-people and business-to-business contacts across member countries; and Building an open and inclusive platform to help strengthen cooperation and build synergies with other international and regional cooperation mechanisms active in the region, and maximize development partners’ resources and expertise to support regional cooperation.

CAREC 2030 prioritizes five operational clusters, encompassing both traditional and new areas of cooperation:

In addition, CAREC supports the integration of information and communication technology (ICT) across the spectrum of CAREC operations to promote productivity and efficiency gains in all operational clusters.

CAREC 2030 is supported by a renewed institutional framework that promotes countries’ and development partners’ active and sustained participation at both policy and project levels, as well as greater engagement with the private sector and civil society.",freight technology R&D cooperation

MEYER and FASSMER take over world shipbuilding brand,https://www.fassmer.de/en/2022/meyer-and-fassmer-take-over-world-shipbuilding-brand,N/A,"MEYER and FASSMER take over world shipbuilding brand Family-run shipyards decide on joint acquisition of NEPTUN SHIP DESIGN in Rostock, Germany

Papenburg, 13 April 2022 – The MEYER Group and the FASSMER company decide to jointly acquire the renowned shipbuilding engineering company NEPTUN SHIP DESIGN in Rostock with around 100 employees. The company with more than 30 years of experience and customers all over the world shall continue to operate independently and in its current structure. Additional jobs are to be created to strengthen the engineering office. This will enable NEPTUN SHIP DESIGN to continue to serve customers worldwide with its recognized high level of expertise, while at the same time implementing projects for the two German shipyard groups. MEYER and FASSMER are thus strengthening their focus on the development and construction of highly complex special ships, on which the future market for new ships will concentrate.

In this way, two successful German specialized shipyards, managed as family-owned companies in the seventh and fifth generations, are committed to preserving qualified shipbuilding jobs in Germany. Approval of the takeover by the Cartel Office is still pending. ""We are strengthening our Rostock location with our involvement in NEPTUN WERFT, MEYER NEPTUN Engineering and now NEPTUN SHIP DESIGN. For us, this commitment is a clear commitment to this location,"" says Bernard Meyer, Managing Director of MEYER WERFT.

""The production of technically complex special ships is very construction-intensive and requires a lot of experience. With NEPTUN SHIP DESIGN, we are gaining a partner who has already supported us with a great deal of competence in recent years, including, for example, the new construction of the LNG-fueled ""ATAIR"". Special shipbuilding will continue to dominate the newbuilding market in Germany and Europe. We therefore see a lot of potential in this cooperation,"" adds Harald Fassmer, managing partner at FASSMER.

""I am very pleased that we have found two renowned German companies that want to preserve the jobs at NEPTUN SHIP DESIGN and further develop the company,"" says Dr. Christoph Morgen, insolvency administrator of MV Werften.

Further tailwind for sustainability strategy

The MEYER Group and FASSMER are thus further expanding their cooperation. Both shipyards will develop and build the new German research vessel METEOR IV by 2026. ""NEPTUN SHIP DESIGN will also play a significant role in this project, giving it a new long-term perspective. In addition, we plan to hire new engineers. This cooperation will support us in achieving our ambitious sustainability goals. All three companies have been committed to this for many years. Now we are jointly giving these activities further tailwind and can offer our solutions for sustainable shipping also outside our shipyard groups,"" says Malte Poelmann, Chief Technology Officer of MEYER Group.

It is particularly pleasing that the long-standing managing directors of the engineering company will also be involved again as shareholders. Under the management of Helge Sell, Stephan Merkel and Roland Gräber, NEPTUN SHIP DESIGN looks back on a history of more than 30 years. During this time NEPTUN SHIP DESIGN has realized many successful projects, also with NEPTUN WERFT and FASSMER. Most recently, the company was part of the insolvent MV Werften.

""This combination of continuity, new impulses as well as concrete orders from MEYER and FASSMER and other German shipyards gives NEPTUN SHIP DESIGN positive prospects for the future,"" says Helge Sell, Managing Director of NEPTUN SHIP DESIGN.",freight technology R&D cooperation

Abstract

Urbanisation levels keep rising and all major cities in Europe face common transport and traffic problems. The city of Amsterdam needs a reliable transport and mobility system to foster economic growth, but at the same time transport is causing congestion, pollution and accidents. To scientifically explore the research question, Transport Innovation Adoption Theory and Transition Management Theory are used as theoretical research lenses. The Political Economy Framework Political Economy Framework (PEF) from Feitelson and Salomon (2004), has been complemented with the PESTEL Classification Framework to systematically address the feasibility of Urban Waterway Transport (UWT).



Desk-research and expert interviewing have been used to obtain a rich understanding of the factors determining feasibility and a focus group meeting is organised to envision pathways to overcome existing failure factors. The extent to which waterway transport can be implemented as a sustainable freight transport solution depends on the condition that the alternative, road transport, becomes less attractive. Many of the canal walls and bridges in Amsterdam are in bad condition and as a result of maintenance projects and a ban on heavy freight vehicles in the centre, road accessibility is considered to decrease. This stimulates a modal shift towards waterway transport, but a lack of transshipment locations, vague transport policy and failing cooperation seem reason for failing implementation.



Currently, clear policy and efficient transshipment technology are lacking. Both public and private actors recognised the importance of executing pilots to fill existing knowledge gaps regarding the development of transport policy and technology. Waterway transporters are willing to participate in long-term pilots, but require political support in the form of temporarily transshipment permits and subsidies to succeed. Conflicting public interests and a lack of long-term focus seem to hold against the providence of financial and regulatory support.



For practical purposes, this thesis contributes by recommending the Transition Management Approach to foster sustainable waterway transport development. Three practical policy strategies are suggested to foster the potential for implementing urban waterway transport in Amsterdam.

This study theoretically contributes by providing an innovative analysis framework that constitutes a pragmatic, dynamic and multi-level perspective approach to improve understanding on innovation implementation. To support policy makers and scientists in the evaluation of innovations, it is recommended to explore and improve the applicability of the suggested framework by applying the framework to address other cases.

N.C. A&T Hosted Technology Day Ahead of ...,https://www.ncat.edu/news/2024/05/ncat-hosted-technology-day-event.php,22 мая 2024 г.,"By Michiko Horie, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering program assistant

EAST GREENSBORO, N.C. (May 22, 2024) – Greensboro hosted the 2024 N.C. Transportation Summit drawing more than 1,200 attendees from all over the world, with more than 100 sponsors and exhibitors May 21-22. The summit provided a platform for discussions ranging from safety and funding to innovation, all aimed at addressing North Carolina’s evolving population and transportation needs.

North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University hosted Technology Day on May 20 at the transportation facility at Gateway Research Park North Campus. The pre-summit event provided an opportunity to demonstrate cutting-edge transportation technologies developed or deployed by the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), universities and industry.

“During this technical tour, we have the opportunity to witness the groundbreaking advancements that are shaping the future of our field,” said N.C. Transportation Secretary Joey Hopkins. “We have a great mix of technology enthusiasts, industry experts and visionaries who share our passion for excellence and forward-thinking solutions.

“Beyond the technology on display, today is also about forging connections, and fostering collaboration. It’s about coming together to exchange ideas and share experiences. There is no end to what we can accomplish by partnering together.”

The event also included a live demonstration of the fleet of Aggie Autonomous shuttles developed by N.C. A&T researchers, as well as demonstrations of other transportation technologies by various exhibitors including electric vehicles and buses, unmanned aerial systems, wheelchair charging and more, all showcased on the rural test track at Gateway Research Park.

“When we talk about transportation, it is the great connector,” said Stephanie Luster-Teasley Pass, Ph.D., A&T College of Engineering dean. “When we look at what we’ve done to strategically invest in infrastructure, we’re looking at transportation technology, public transportation and rural and underserved communities. As a land-grant institution, we really want to get out into the community and with your support we, along with other researchers in the state, can improve the human condition.”

The Aggie Autonomous shuttles are state-of-the-art automated driving vehicles developed and deployed by talented researchers at A&T. These shuttles have been developed to provide better transportation choices in rural areas, as well as connecting places that have little to no access to public transportation. The shuttles were deployed on public streets of downtown Greensboro for about one month in September 2023 through a pilot program sponsored by NCDOT and the U.S. Department of Transportation under a technology transfer funding mechanism.

The visitors arrived to the pre-summit event in Greensboro Transit Agency electric buses, then were welcomed and guided to the main exhibit area by Starship Robots. Demonstrations and exhibits from NCDOT, A&T, North Carolina State University, Starship Technologies, Causey Aviation, FlyTrex, and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers USA’s MOVE Community Outreach preceded opening remarks by Hopkins. He was followed by addresses from Luster-Teasley Pass; Ebony Pittman, NCDOT deputy secretary from COMTO-NC; Reggie Scales, managing director of VHB; and closing remarks by Ali Karimoddini, Ph.D., director of the CR2C2 Regional University Transportation Center at A&T.

As guests explored the technology and engaged in deeper conversations with exhibitors, A&T and N.C. State researchers provided autonomous vehicle rides on a fleet of three Aggie Autonomous shuttles and a Tesla supervised self-driving system, giving the guests a first-hand experience on the rural test track unveiled in 2022. This two-mile track features rural driving scenarios and allows researchers to test vehicles in real-world conditions. This transportation facility is also host to a steadily growing autonomous vehicle fleet, which now includes six automated driving vehicles of varying sizes and capabilities.",freight technology R&D cooperation

Transport Outlook 2050,https://www.are.admin.ch/transport-outlook,N/A,"A basis for transport and spatial planning at the Confederation

The results of Transport Outlook 2050 are used by planners working in the fields of mobility, spatial planning and the environment, for example to compile road infrastructure programmes or timetables. The results are also used as a basis for transport policy and spatial planning decisions, such as those set out in the Mobility and space 2050 - sectoral plan for transport, program part. Furthermore, the DETEC offices use the results for their outlooks on energy use and estimates of noise and air pollutant emissions.

The Transport Outlook 2050 outlines four 'if-then' scenarios with a vision of how passenger and freight transport could develop. The Basis scenario shows how traffic could develop if the federal government's current mobility objectives are pursued. The other three scenarios are alternative development paths. All scenarios are based on different assumptions, such as when politicians will take measures to achieve the Paris climate targets; how quickly environmentally friendly technologies will become established; and how important ownership and sustainability are to individuals. In addition, two sensitivity analysis with higher and lower population and economic development were realized for the «Basis» scenario.

The Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario envisages proceeding as now within the current regulative framework, with little change. The two scenarios Individualised Society (InS) and Sustainable Society (SuS) assume that transport is strongly impacted by technical innovations, such as the automation of passenger vehicles. However, technologies are used for different purposes ‒ either for individual comfort (Individualised Society) or for sustainability and resource conservation (Sustainable Society).

The Basis scenario is that used by the FOT and FEDRO to develop infrastructure and services, and is used by ARE to draw up its agglomeration programmes. It replaces the reference scenario of Transport Outlook 2040, which was published in 2016. The other scenarios serve to show the spectrum of possible developments in order to obtain robust planning results.

The Transport Outlook is updated when there are changes to key factors such as population and economic scenarios, or when updates are made to key data in the mobility sector, such as the Mobility and Transport Microcensus.",freight technology R&D cooperation

Overview of the Green Innovation Fund Projects,https://green-innovation.nedo.go.jp/en/about/,N/A,"Overview of the Green Innovation Fund Projects

In October 2020, Japan declared that it aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, with the goal of reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. Carbon neutrality by 2050 cannot be realized through ordinary efforts. It is necessary to significantly accelerate efforts toward structural changes in the energy and industrial sectors, and undertake bold investment for innovation.

METI decided to develop a Green Innovation Fund at the level of 2 trillion yen* as part of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). The plan, based on the specific goals shared by public and private sectors, is to continuously support companies and other organizations for the coming ten years, which show their commitment to challenge such ambitious goals as their business issues ranging from research and development (R&D) to demonstrations to social implementation of the outcomes.

â»*300 billion yen has been added to the second supplementary budget for FY2022, and 456.4 billion yen will be added to the initial budget for FY2023 (as of July 2023).

Basic Policies for Green Innovation Fund (Summary)

01 Purpose and Outline To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, METI established a 2 trillion-yen fund as part of NEDO and provide continuous support for R&D projects, demonstrations, and social implementation projects for up to 10 years to companies that commit to ambitious goals. 02 Program Target 03 Support Target METIâs support will focus on priority fields for which implementation plans have been formulated within the Green Growth Strategy, or key fields for which a future roadmap has been presented based on the âBasic Policy for Realization of GXâ, where policy effects are significant, and long-term continuous support is required to realize public implementation. Average size of conventional R&D projects (20 billion yen) or more.

Projects for which short-term government support programs is sufficient are not eligible.

Main implementers should be companies or other profit-making businesses capable of carrying out the entire process of public implementation (participation of small and medium-sized venture companies is encouraged; participation of universities and research institutions is also expected).

The project must include innovative and fundamental R&D elements that are worthy of being commissioned by the government. 04 Strategy for Maximizing Results To ensure that research and development results are steadily implemented publicly, METI seeks the commitment of the managers of companies and other organizations to persevere in challenging these goals as long-term business issues. (Efforts required of company managers) Submission of the vision and the long-term business strategy at the time of application

"Japan Signs Railgun Cooperation Agreement With France, ...",https://www.thedefensepost.com/2024/06/04/japan-railgun-france-germany/,4 июн. 2024 г.,"Japan’s defense acquisition organization has signed a cooperation agreement on railgun technology with France and Germany.

The Implementation Guidelines for Railgun Technology Cooperation seeks to accelerate the weapon’s development in light of current geopolitical tensions in Europe and East Asia, Zona Militar wrote, referring to the agreement.

Japan’s Railgun Quest

Japan has been developing the weapon since 2016, testing its maiden railgun counter-hypersonic weapon last year.

The country set aside 6.5 billion yen ($56 million) for the weapon in 2022, aiming for deployment by the end of this decade.

France and Germany, meanwhile, are leading the four-nation PILUM railgun project to develop an electromagnetic railgun capable of firing hypervelocity projectiles (over 11,000 kilometers/6,700 miles per hour) up to 200 kilometers (124 miles) away.

US Navy Railgun Project

In a related development, Japanese defense officials visited the US earlier this year to benefit from the US Navy’s railgun experience.

The US military launched two railgun projects in the last few years but aborted both of them over financial and feasibility concerns.

The US Navy canceled its 15-year railgun project in 2021 due to fiscal and technological constraints.

A 32-megajoule railgun was developed by BAE Systems in a laboratory setting under the project.

The Railgun

A railgun uses electromagnetic force to fire high-velocity projectiles at up to Mach 7.

A greater speed than conventional munitions allows the railgun to launch projectiles in larger quantities toward targets, enhancing the chance of interception.

However, the technology comes with its share of challenges, such as the need for greater operating power compared to conventional weapons, making the weapon susceptible to overheating.

“Railguns operate by exerting extreme electromagnetic forces on a projectile, but those forces act against the railgun structure itself. This means they tend to self-destruct,” National Defense Magazine quoted the National Defense Industrial Association’s Emerging Technologies Institute’s Mark Lewis as saying.

Strategist at the New America think tank Peter W. Singer added, “If the technical issues were worked out, which is an obvious ‘if,’ it would have significant application in areas ranging from anti-missile to strike, you name it.

MAN and ABB E-mobility sign cooperation agreement on technical collaboration

Megawatt charging system (MCS) marks the start of strategic cooperation

Cooperation to focus even more strongly on the needs of logistics customers

HEIDELBERG, Germany and MUNICH and LAS VEGAS, Jan. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- MAN Truck & Bus, a leading European commercial vehicle manufacturer, and ABB E-mobility have signed an exclusive cooperation agreement as the companies announced at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. The aim of the strategic partnership is to work together even more closely together, particularly in the area of research and development.

Thomas Nickels, Senior Vice President Engineering at MAN, sees the cooperation as a specialty in the market: ""Cooperation in the area of research and development is rather rare in our industry. Together with ABB E-mobility, we are striving for a trusting, binding and transparent partnership. We are already starting with the development of products and standards and are focusing on the special requirements of the commercial vehicle industry.""

The importance of cross-industry cooperation for the entire sector is particularly evident for megawatt charging system (MCS), Nickels continued: ""At MCS, we are working with players from the entire sector to enable charging capacities in the megawatt range in the future and thus sustainable and economical long-distance heavy goods and passenger transport. By cooperating with ABB E-mobility, we can tackle the challenges of the new technology at an early stage and drive standardization forward more quickly.""

These challenges include the ISO15118-20 communication standard and new ways of transmitting signals. The basis for MCS is Ethernet communication, which is being used for the first time in electromobility. Early software and interoperability tests with vehicles and charging stations should help to establish reliable products as quickly as possible in an emerging market environment. This is why the cooperation, which is initially scheduled to run for three years, is focusing on the customer experience right from the start, in addition to the internal development and further development of charging stations, vehicles and software.

""High charging performance, reliable technology and customer confidence – these are the prerequisites for the success of electromobility in heavy goods and long-distance passenger transport. By working together with MAN right from the early product phase, we can respond even better to the needs of our customers. By 2025, we want to bring a product to the market that meets the requirements of logistics,"" says Floris van de Klashorst, Senior Vice President Products & Hardware Platforms at ABB E-mobility.

""The market needs an ecosystem that interlocks and works reliably. That's why we want to jointly develop a concept for the interaction of MCS and CCS that addresses issues such as space, energy supply and grid expansion. MAN's extensive expertise helps us to develop customer-oriented solutions – both for use in the depot and on the track,"" says van de Klashorst, giving an outlook on future projects.

The cooperation is not just limited to logistics: ""MCS will also be used in future in the travel sector, for example for motorhomes and coaches. This will bring additional challenges and a change in user behavior,"" continues the Head of Development.

30 Years of Cooperation | Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS),https://www.greatermekong.org/,N/A,"Transport Transport lies at the heart of GMS cooperation. The development of physical infrastructure complemented with policies and procedures for crossing borders and developing trade along key routes have been central to efforts to forge a truly interconnected subregion.

Environment Natural ecosystems – and the food, water, energy, and other vital elements they provide – lie at the heart of the development of the GMS. How these natural resources are protected, managed, and enhanced will determine the long-term sustainability of its environment and economic development.

Energy New energy solutions are crucial to developing the GMS, where power demand is surging. These include improving energy efficiency and cross-border power trading.

Urban Development By 2050, GMS is expected to be at least 50% urbanized. Careful planning is needed to balance urban growth with environmental protection and economic equity so that healthy cities can be enjoyed by all residents.

Trade & Transport Facilitation The GMS Transport and Trade Facilitation Action Program is working to overcome existing barriers in order to link the subregion to the ASEAN Economic Community’s single market and production base, as well as other regional cooperation initiatives.

Health Cooperation Regional integration creates opportunities to draw on the subregion’s health leadership, human resource skills, and programming experience to address common health challenges.

Tourism Countries in the GMS are working together to promote the subregion as a single destination for international visitors and encourage communities to enhance the environmental, social, and economic benefits of tourism.",freight technology R&D cooperation

This method can be used in conceptual analysis, when there are no other tools like statewide models with mode share and mode choice models encompassing modes in consideration. These methods are also all mostly suited for intermodal diversion and directed towards long haul movements. They are driven by literature search of applicable guidance documents and academic literature. These are most often observed for truckârail and railâtruck diversions. They have not been documented for pipeline/waterway/marine contexts. These estimates should be vetted for feasibility analysis, preferably by industry experts and/or stakeholders.

Design and Evaluation of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise ...,https://etd.auburn.edu/handle/10415/7069,Автор: WG Apperson,"Abstract

This thesis describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) system for heavy freight trucks that seeks to provide a platform for future cooperative control and estimation schemes. The freight trucking industry is the primary method of transporting goods in the United States. Approximately 70 percent of all transported goods travel by freight trucking. It is estimated that the freight trucking industry in the US spends close to 10 billion dollars on fuel each year. Most of the industrys time and fuel is consumed on long interstate corridors. Due to the high volume of these vehicles, there is huge potential benefit for a collaborative scheme of control. This control algorithm can help vehicles reduce fuel consumption, emissions, driver fatigue, and traffic congestion. By reducing the inter-vehicle spacing and automating throttle and brakes, all of these goals can be accomplished. This control system is known as CACC and is particularity valuable for freight vehicles as they can see significant value from reduced air drag by staying within the wake of a preceding truck. CACC systems have been in development for many years now and are beginning to be tested on real-world convoys. There is still some potential savings to be gained through controller optimization. To validate new control and estimation techniques a vehicle testing platform is required. The primary contribution of this work is in the development of a platform for future research and validation as a proof of concept. The system is comprised of a communication network between vehicles, a low-level brake and throttle controller, a range estimation scheme and a cascaded gap controller. Testing results from this system both in simulation and on-highway driving are presented and show fuel savings of approximately 2-3 percent. While the fuel savings achieved under this work are not as high as predicted, it is expected that with further controller optimization will yield results in line with that of other researchers. The vehicle platform developed, however, was shown to be stable and will provide a good basis for future research.",freight technology R&D cooperation
National Cooperative Highway Research Program,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Cooperative_Highway_Research_Program,N/A,"NCHRP 50th Anniversary Logo

The National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) conducts research in problem areas that affect highway planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance in the United States. Spearheaded by the Transportation Research Board (TRB), part of the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine, it is jointly supported by federal agencies, state departments of transportation (DOTs), and other nonprofit organizations.

Funding [ edit ]

The National Cooperative Highway Research Program was established in 1962 under TRB. Governments needed to tackle what Rex M. Whitton termed “clearly a supreme challenge to research”: moving people and goods in cities by using a fixed percentage of highway funding dedicated to research. Whitton envisioned that this research would encompass studies of human behavior, land use, employment, and new technologies.[1] Another anecdote contributing to NCHRP's founding comes from the late 1950s when it was noted that 32 state DOTs were researching the same topic without any knowledge of each other’s work. This revelation provided incentive for the states to pool their resources on a national research program addressing common problems. The extent of duplicative and isolated research was mentioned in a conversation between Edward Holmes of the Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) and Alfred E. Johnson, the American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) executive director at the time.[2]

It is sponsored by American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). This program is funded by all the state highway and transportation departments.[3] State departments of transportation are requested to contribute 5.5% of their State Planning and Research (SP&R) funds each year. Annual NCHRP funding has been approximately $37 million in recent years.[4]

FHWA provides the funds to the NCHRP through a cooperative agreement with the National Academy of Sciences, the parent organization of the Transportation Research Board.[4]

Steven E. Shladover - California PATH,https://path.berkeley.edu/steven-e-shladover,N/A,"Dr. Shladover was one of the pioneers in the creation of the ITS program in the U.S., beginning with work on founding the California PATH Program in the mid 1980s. He received his bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees in Mechanical Engineering from MIT, where he also satisfied all the course requirements for a doctorate in Transportation Systems. He began working on applications of information technology to improving surface transportation as a graduate student in 1973, and has worked since then on a wide variety of research projects. He combines hard-core engineering expertise in dynamic systems and control with knowledge of transportation system policy, planning and economics, which enables him to effectively apply rigorous analysis methods to complicated transportation problems. He was one of the first researchers to do in-depth investigations of probe vehicle data sampling in the days of the ""vehicle­ infrastructure integration"" initiative, identifying limitations in the existing probe sampling protocols and recommending modifications.

Dr. Shladover has been managing a wide range of ITS research projects at PATH, with a particular emphasis on cooperative systems and vehicle automation. He was the site program manager for PATH’s participation in the National Automated HighwaySystems Consortium (1994-8) and subsequent to that he led PATH’s development of bus and truck platoon systems andcooperative ACC systems. He pioneered the study of cooperative ACC in the U.S., beginning with computer simulations of thepossible effects on traffic flow, which were sufficiently encouraging to lead to the creation of an experimental program. He ledthe development and evaluation of the performance of two generations of CACC systems at PATH, producing the only sustainedbody of research on this subject (and the only implementations on real vehicles) in the U.S.

Dr. Shladover’s work is widely recognized internationally, and he has held many leadership positions in professional organizations. He chaired the TRB ITS Committee from 2004-2010 and will be chairing the TRB Committee on Vehicle-HighwayAutomation starting in 2013. He chaired the ASME Dynamic Systems and Control Division (DSCD) in 1995-6 and has been leading the U.S. delegation to ISO TC204/WG14, developing international standards for vehicle-roadway warning and control systems for the past twenty years. He is on the editorial advisory boards of the leading journals in intelligent transportation systems, Transportation Research Part C, Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems and IET Intelligent Transport Systems.Dr. Shladover was honored with the ASME DSCD’s Charles Stark Draper Award for Innovative Practice in 2008 and theAmerican Automatic Control Council’s Control Engineering Practice Award in 2011.

EXPERIENCE

University of California PATH Program - August 1989 - present Research Engineer

Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Exploratory Advanced Research Program -Advanced Traffic Signal Control Algorithms - Task leader for evaluation of probe vehicle sampling approaches in simulation. This project is identifying opportunities for developing a new generation of traffic signal control strategies and algorithms that can take advantage of the richer data provided by connected vehicles acting as traffic data probes. The probe sampling challenges are much greater for arterial signal control than for freeway operations because of the greater complexity of the traffic patterns and the flow interruptions caused by signal cycles. Fusion of probe data with conventional loop detector data is also being studied here.

Caltrans - VII California Program - Task leader for development and evaluation of probe vehicle sampling strategies, beginning with SAE J2735 probe sampling protocols. Dr. Shladover led an in-depth evaluation of the SAE J2735 sampling protocols to identify their limitations for use in arterial signal control, based on sampling of simulated data representing a high­ volume arterial corridor with coordinated actuated signal control. This study revealed the need to modify the J2735 protocols in order to reduce latency and increase the fidelity of representation of actual vehicle trajectories, and also showed the importance of aggregating probe data as early as possible in order to minimize the backhaul communication burden and to destroy personally identifiable information so that crippling restrictions imposed to protect privacy could be lifted.",freight technology R&D cooperation
CADMATIC and PROSTEP agree on development cooperation,https://www.prostep.com/en/press/details/cadmatic-and-prostep-agree-on-development-cooperation,N/A,"CADMATIC and PROSTEP agree on development cooperation

Darmstadt/Turku, September 2019 – CADMATIC Ltd, a leading developer of 3D-based design, engineering and information management software for the marine, process and energy, and construction industries, and vendor-independent PLM consulting and software company PROSTEP AG are intensifying their cooperation delivering end-to-end digital shipbuilding and shipping solutions.

Building on many years of successful and trustworthy cooperation in integration projects with renowned customers like MEYER Group, both companies have signed a Letter of Intent to enter into a closer development partnership. The intention of the partners is to further develop and maintain the existing CADMATIC connectivity in the context of PROSTEP’s integration platform OpenPDM SHIP.

Based on PROSTEP’s proven OpenPDM technology, which is used by many companies in the automotive and other sectors to support integration, migration and collaboration scenarios, OpenPDM SHIP is an integration platform specially designed for the marine industry. It connects shipbuilding specific development systems via standardized connectors with common PDM/PLM and ERP systems as well as with mechanical CAD applications and thus creates the prerequisite for integrated digital processes and information flows in shipbuilding and shipping.

CADMATIC software is a leading design software vendor worldwide for the shipbuilding industry. More than 800 ship design offices, shipyards and shipbuilding companies use CADMATIC for basic, detailed and production design of any type of vessel and offshore project. The standard-based connector to OpenPDM SHIP does not only facilitate the import of CADMATIC data into common PDM/PLM systems to manage and trace the digital ship’s lifecycle, but also allows the exchange of model information with other production control and facilitation systems used in shipbuilding without any data losses.

“Integration with CADMATIC is the key to enable end-to-end digital processes and information flows in shipbuilding”, says Matthias Grau, Product Manager OpenPDM SHIP in Hamburg. “We are happy to enter a closer development partnership with CADMATIC to be able to offer CADMATIC customers enhanced connectivity with standard enterprise PDM / ERP environments as well as upstream and downstream systems in the ship development process. It is a win for customers, CADMATIC and for us.”

PROSTEP is one of the leading experts for PLM integration, migration and supplier collaboration in the marine industry, as Jukka Rantala, CEO of CADMATIC, points out. “Through this partnership, we can provide our customers with digital information management solutions for the entire shipbuilding life cycle.

Adaptation (adjusting to current and future climate impacts) or environmental protection, health and safety

The Fund will invest across climate tech verticals, including but not limited to energy, mobility, circular economy, water, food/agriculture and more. The Fund intends to invest in 25 companies over a 10-year investment period. Seed-stage through later-stage (series B/C) investments will be considered for funding, as well as venture funds based in CT or open to relocating here.

Funded companies will receive ongoing strategic support from CI’s experienced investment team, which has already built an active climate tech portfolio, including Budderfly, Cadenza, Enviropower, Greenworks Lending, Tantalus, CoolIT Systems and more.



Who can apply?

Any early-stage or growth company focused on climate change located in Connecticut or interested in building a presence in the Northeast may apply. Climate-change-focused companies that are not currently in state but are interested in growing jobs here will be expected to establish some Connecticut presence as part of a CI investment opportunity. Venture funds/firms in CT or those looking to move their headquarters to Connecticut are also encouraged to apply.

When is the application deadline?

Applications are accepted and reviewed on a rolling basis; there are no deadlines.

Is this funding an investment we would have to pay back, or a grant?

The funding is an investment by Connecticut Innovations—not a grant. CI can participate in priced equity rounds, convertible notes, SAFEs (Simple Agreement for Future Equity), and other equity and blended debt instruments.

What size are these investments? How are the terms of repayment defined?

An initial investment amount will almost always range between $150,000 and $2 million in a given financing round capped at $20 million. No personal guarantee is required.

How does my company begin the process?

To begin the process, submit the requested information here. You will be contacted by Connecticut Innovations staff within one week. You’ll be required to upload a pitch deck.

What should be included as part of the investor deck?

The presentation should include references to the company’s leadership and team, technology/product, potential climate impact, value proposition, target market size, go-to-market strategy, business model and fundraising plan.

How should I prepare my financials?

Financials should include the most up-to-date balance sheet, cash flow and income statements if available. Companies should provide a forecast detailing expected sources and uses of funding.

Is a business plan required? What should it include?

You are not required to submit a business plan. If you choose to include one, it should include, at a minimum, an executive summary, value proposition, business structure, market strategy, details about your leadership team and the financial state of the company.

How long does the process take, from initial contact to when we learn if we are approved?

CI will contact you within a week of receiving your materials. If we move forward with due diligence, the investment process will take anywhere from two to four months (as is the case with almost all investment firms). The length of the investment process depends on your team’s relevant experience, the size of the market, the uniqueness of the product offering, the value-add of the investment and other factors.

Danish Shipping Finance (Danmakes Skibskredit) has been acquired by UK and UAE-based investment group Magellan Capital.

The financing company was owned by The Danish Maritime Fund, Axcel, PFA, and PKA. The Fund has kept a 10% stake, but Axcel, PFA and PKA have agreed to sell their shares in the firm.

Axcel said it will retain a 5% shareholding for two years to “ensure a smooth ownership transition”.

Magellan Capital will hold 90% of the company shares, otherwise known as A-shares, once Axcel exits fully.

Eivind Kolding, Chairman of the Board of Directors, comments: “We are pleased that the company’s three majority shareholders have agreed to sell Danish Ship Finance to an owner who takes a long-term perspective of the investment and values the company’s core strengths and conservative business approach.”

The Board will remain largely unchanged, with chairman Eivind Kolding and board members Christian Frigast, Jacob Meldgaard, Thor Jørgen Guttormsen, and Peter Nyegaard remaining in their roles.

Our origin and values,https://indrive.com/en/our-story/about-us/,N/A,"Our origin and values

inDrive began as an exercise of justice. It was New Year’s Eve 2012 in the northern city of Yakutsk, when temperatures dropped to -45°C (-49 °F), and local taxi companies responded with a coordinated doubling of their rates, leaving many locals stranded in the Siberian winter. This collusive and unfair price hike angered the citizens of Yakutsk, who banded together on social media to request, offer, and most importantly, agree on fair prices for their rides. This grassroots, collective, online action eventually became the inDrive app. Transparency, fairness, and innovative use of technology to challenge injustice are the foundational values that power inDrive to this day. inDrive has created mobility solutions that enable choice while retaining a human element. Our platform allows drivers and riders to agree on the price, route, and other details for each ride between themselves. Our peer-to-peer model allows for greater transparency and choice, challenging many injustices that characterize mobility providers, including impersonal algorithms, unfair conditions for drivers, and price manipulation. Founded in 2013, today inDrive is available in over 749 cities across 46 countries on five continents. In 2022, it was the second most downloaded ride-hailing app worldwide based on Google Play and App Store data. inDrive was incorporated in the US in 2018, and its head office is located in Mountain View, California. The group employs over 3,000 people worldwide. In early 2021, inDrive achieved the unicorn status after closing a $150m investment round with Insight Partners, General Catalyst, and Bond Capital, valuing the company at $1.23 billion. In 2023, inDrive raised $150 million from General Catalyst in an innovative hybrid instrument to boost growth, expand its offering and invest in new verticals. inDrive is committed to challenging injustice in communities around the world. In addition to mobility solutions, we offer intercity transportation, delivery, and freight services, as well as job search and on-demand task services across different markets. Along with maintaining fair play in business, inDrive runs 8 global-scale non-profit programs. We are dedicated to supporting access to education, sports, and arts in local communities – after all, inDrive originated as a people-driven solution, and we believe that investing in community development creates endless opportunities for a global positive impact. inDrive is a company run by people, for people, because no technology in the world can replace human empathy. As of July 2022, the company no longer has any legal presence in Russia, having divested its Russian entity and with no plans for further investments in the market. The divested Russian business, which now operates under a different brand, is independently managed and financed, completely severed from the company.",innovative shipping solutions investment

Next-generation Ship Development,https://green-innovation.nedo.go.jp/en/project/development-next-generation-vessels/,N/A,"Project Overview

As of 2018, international shipping accounts for approximately 2.1% of global CO 2 emissions. Since the global economy is growing, demand for shipping is expected to continue increasing and, if no action is taken, CO 2 emissions from the shipping sector will also continue to increase.

To achieve carbon neutrality in the shipping sector, it is essential to move away from existing heavy oil-based fuels to gas fuels such as hydrogen, ammonia, and clean methane from recycled carbon dioxide. It is also necessary to develop shipping products that utilize hydrogen and ammonia as fuels and reduce âmethane slipâ on vessels fueled by LNG that contains clean methane from recycled carbon dioxide.

With the goal of realizing zero-emission ships by 2050, under this project, engines, fuel tanks, and fuel supply systems will be developed for ships using hydrogen and ammonia fuels and carry out demonstration operations using actual ships. Technology will also be developed to prevent methane slip, an important challenge for using LNG-fueled ships. The project ultimately aims to strengthen the international competitiveness of Japan's shipping-related industries, and promote social implementation in conjunction with the shipping industry.",innovative shipping solutions investment

This Database contains profiles of SIBs compiled using publicly available information, including program location, launch date, target population, and stakeholders. We downloaded all available data as of 20 November 2018, converted monetary values into US dollars (OECD.Stat n.d.), and classified SIBs located in Wales or England within a UK grouping. The analysis took place in two main stages: an ‘investor classifications’ stage and a ‘program classifications’ stage. Investor classifications To determine if SIBs can attract private capital, we examined the proportion of up-front investors who were for-profit. We categorized all UK and US SIB investors into six categories: 1) charities, trusts, and foundations (‘charities’), 2) for-profit limited companies, 3) public bodies, 4) social enterprises, 5) registered social landlords (RSLs) or housing associations, and 6) private individuals. Charities are those organizations which are designated as such by charities or tax law due to their charitable activities. For-profit limited companies are organizations which pursue traditional profit maximization. Public bodies are those entities which are branches of local or national governments. Social enterprises can take a variety of legal structures, including charities, limited companies, and community interest companies. However, their defining characteristic is that they are primarily operating with social purposes. RSLs and landlord associations are a UK-specific category of organizations that often take the form of charities or social enterprises, but generally have more assets and are larger in size. Finally, private individuals are those charitable or philanthropic individuals investing their own money as opposed to investing on behalf of larger organizations. To sort investors into these six categories, we relied upon self-reported information from the organizations – for instance, as stated on their institutional websites or professional profiles such as LinkedIn and Charity Navigator. If further information was required, we looked at textual descriptions provided in press releases or other organizational documents. Even after careful analysis, the classification of about 5 programs could be contested, especially those which display characteristics of social enterprises. For example, the Goldman Sachs Urban Investment Group, which invested in the US’s Green Infrastructure program, participates in impact investing – an activity typically associated with social enterprises. Given the Group’s situation within the broader Goldman Sachs’ institution, we labeled it as a for-profit limited company. The conclusions of this study are not altered by how these few programs are classified. Program classifications The programs classifications analysis focused on determining at what stage SIBs are funding programs within the social innovation process: pilot testing or scaling. To extract evidence from the Database’s text-based profiles to classify programs, we applied content analysis to identify trends and patterns within the text using categories and coding (Stemler, Reference Stemler2000). Using an inductive approach to allow concepts to emerge from the data (Elo and Kyngas, Reference Elo and Kyngas2007: 113), we began by reviewing the types of data contained within the Database’s profile texts and determining which stages of the social innovation process could be coded and categorized. As expected, this analysis uncovered that, as of yet, little data is available regarding the extent to which SIBs are engaging in co-production or are contributing to systems change. As is further explained in the Discussion section, while many SIB profiles refer to some relevant aspects of co-production – for instance, providing personalized support – no profiles offered specific information about how such approaches were designed or implemented. Similarly, given the recent implementation of SIBs, the analysis found few data within the Database regarding the extent to which SIB programs and strategies are being diffused into broader systems. On the other hand, the content analysis did reveal sufficient evidence to categorize programs as either operating at the pilot or scaled stage. Pilots versus scaled Based on the initial content analysis, which categorized SIBs as either pilot or scaled interventions (see appendix 1), the first classification strategy defined programs as pilots or scaled interventions quantitatively based on the size of a program’s target population as well as the amount of capital invested in each program. We coded programs as pilots if they had target populations below 300 and if they had a budget (‘capital raised’) of less than $2 million. If the Database did not contain any information on these two variables, we did not categorize the program as either pilot or scaled. There were seven such programs. If the Database was missing information on one of the variables, we classified the program according to the variable that was available. Feasibility versus effectiveness For a more robust analysis, and as a validity check, the analysis then utilized a second typology using qualitative criteria such as each program’s objectives and methods for evaluating outcomes. Following scholars (e.g. Ettelt et al., Reference Ettelt, Mays and Allen2015) who have begun to suggest ways of classifying different types of social innovation, we created and operationalized our own typology: programs testing feasibility versus programs testing effectiveness. We conceptualized programs testing feasibility to be comparable to pilot programs and programs testing effectiveness to be comparable to scaled interventions. This feasibility/effectiveness analysis also took an inductive approach to content analysis. We classified programs as testing feasibility if their objectives appeared to align more with learning from implementation processes or demonstrating a proof of concept. These programs were characterized as not being based upon an already proven intervention and not using rigorous evaluation methods. Programs testing feasibility were also more likely to measure programmatic outcomes, reference “learning” or “adapting”, and claim they were the “first” program to be implemented in some way. Conversely, we classified as testing effectiveness those programs that aimed to demonstrate the replicability or scalability of an intervention. These programs were more likely to be systematized or professionalized – for instance, by being part of a broader SIB funding initiative or by using rate cards to monetize outcomes. Programs testing effectiveness also typically used more rigorous evaluation methods and built upon proven interventions.

Results There are some notable differences between SIB program characteristics in the UK and US (see table 1 ). The range for target population in the UK (14 to 11,000) is much larger than in the US (135 to 4,458); though upon removing one outlier, the maximum in the UK is 4,000.Footnote 3 UK and US programs also have comparable target population means (1,205.2 and 1,239.8) and medians (416 and 562.5), respectively. US programs have more generous SIB budgets (‘capital raised’) than UK programs, with a maximum value of $30 million, compared to $7.7 million in the UK. The average ($2.0 million) and median ($1.5 million) capital raised for UK programs are also much less than the average ($10.3 million) and median ($8.7 million) for US programs. Similar patterns emerge in maximum outcome payments. UK program lengths range from 2 to 10 years, with a mean and median of 3.9 and 3.5 years, respectively. US program durations, meanwhile, have a larger range (3 to 30 years), mean (6.2 years) and median (5.5 years). In addition to this programmatic data, table 2 provides further descriptive data on the number of program stakeholders for UK and US programs – specifically investors, outcome payors, service providers, and intermediaries.Footnote 4 UK programs tend to have fewer investors overall, with a maximum of 13, average of 2.9, and median of 2; in the US the maximum number of investors is 35, average is 5.8, and median is 4. For outcome funders, the maximum number for UK programs is 12, compared to 3 in the US. Meanwhile, the average and median number of outcome funders for UK programs (2.4 and 2) are slightly larger than for US programs (1.3 and 1), respectively. While the maximum number of service providers for UK programs (16) is higher than for US programs (6), the averages for US programs (1.7) and UK programs (2.1) are much closer, and the median for both is 1. Meanwhile, for intermediaries of UK and US SIBs, the maximums are 1 and 2, the averages are 0.6 and 1, and the medians are both 1, respectively. Private sector social financing In the US, a typical SIB has nearly double the number of investors per program compared to the UK; the US also has a much higher percentage of programs with at least one for-profit investor, at around two-thirds of all programs compared to one-sixth in the UK (see figure 3). However, the UK and US have similar percentages of programs with at least one investor classified as a public entity (around 12.5 percent) or a private individual (around 7.5 percent). Conversely, while almost half of the UK programs have at least one charity as an investor, all of the US programs do. In addition, many more UK programs (72 percent) have at least one investor that is a social enterprise than US programs (5 percent). Notably, this social enterprise participation in the UK SIBs was dominated by one major investor – Bridges Fund Management (“Bridges”) – which invested in nearly half of the UK SIBs. Approximately 9 percent of the UK programs have at least one RSL investor (a UK-specific category). In examining the total number of investors involved in all UK and US SIBs, the analysis found a comparable percentage of investors that are for-profit in the UK (12 percent) and US (18 percent) (see figure 4). Further, for both UK and US programs around half of all investors were charities and around 4 percent were public bodies. However, 35 percent of UK program investors were social enterprises compared to only 1 percent for US programs. US programs also have a higher percentage of investors who are private individuals (26 percent) than UK programs (7 percent). In addition, about 5 percent of UK program investors are RSLs. The analysis also uncovered an interesting divergence in the number of repeat investors between the two countries. In the UK, there were 48 unique investors in SIB programs. While each investor contributed to an average of 2.2 SIBs, there were 13 investors (27 percent of all UK investors) who contributed to more than one SIB. Notably, Bridges invested in 21 SIBs (44.7 percent of all UK SIBs) – a considerable number, as the next highest number of SIBs to which one investor contributed was 8 (for Big Issue Invest). Meanwhile, in the US, there were 54 unique investors. Each investor contributed to an average of 1.6 programs, and 14 investors (26 percent of all US investors) contributed to more than one SIB. In the US, the investor who contributed to the most SIBs was the Reinvestment Fund, at 6 SIBs (25 percent of all US SIBs). See appendix 2 for tables listing each unique investor and the number of SIBs in which they invested for both UK and US programs. Overall, the data provide mixed evidence of whether SIBs are behaving as innovative financing tools by utilizing private capital to finance social programs, with considerable differences between the two countries. In particular, the data suggest that participation in SIBs from at least one private actor is happening at much higher rates in the US than the UK, suggesting that US SIBs have been more effective at achieving the goal for social finance instruments of bringing in private capital for social purposes. Conversely, the UK has much higher rates of participation from social enterprises. While attracting social enterprise capital could also be seen as an aim of social finance tools, given that historically social funding has come from charitable trusts and foundations (Albertson et al., Reference Albertson, Bailey, Fox, LaBarbera, O’Leary and Painter2018), it falls short of the objective of attracting more mainstream for-profit investors. In addition, the data reveal further divergence in how UK and US SIBs utilize other capital sources – for instance, from charities or private individuals – and in how they are able to encourage repeat investments. However, the data do not provide information about the share of total investment in each SIB that is coming from these groups relative to other sectors. If the relative percentage is high, this would provide even stronger support for the claim that SIBs are innovative in their ability to bring ‘new’ types of funding to service provision. Piloting and scaling social innovation Within the social innovation process, the analysis focused specifically on classifying programs according to the piloting or scaling stages. It then utilized a secondary approach which equated piloting with testing feasibility and scaling with testing effectiveness. When comparing the piloting/feasibility and scaling/effectiveness classifications, we find that these two typologies matched 78 percent of the time. Further, these two classifications were very similar for the UK programs, with 32 percent of programs classified as pilots and as testing feasibility, and 64 percent of programs classified as scaled interventions and 68 percent as testing effectiveness. However, there were larger differences between the classifications for the US programs using the two typologies. While only 9 percent of US programs were classified as pilots, 18 percent were classified as testing feasibility. Additionally, while 91 percent of programs were classified as scaled interventions, 82 percent were classified as testing effectiveness. The results from the first classification process are summarized in figure 5, while the results from the second classification process are provided in figure 6. In sum, the evidence of how SIB use fits within the process of social innovation suggests variation in how SIBs are used to fund the stages of piloting and scaling between the UK and US, as well as in how SIBs are used within each country. Nonetheless, we find that both UK and US SIBs tend to fund more programs operating at the scaled intervention level and testing effectiveness than programs operating at the pilot level and testing feasibility. We also find that under both approaches the US consistently funds even fewer programs operating at the pilot stage and testing feasibility than the UK. As such, the evidence suggests that early UK and US SIBs were only supporting the social innovation process in limited ways.

Discussion This study provides important evidence on the nature of SIBs as viewed through a social innovation framework. First, as a tool that can bring in private capital for the production of public goods, we found that a little over 60 percent of US SIBs included a private sector funder, while a little over 70 percent of UK SIBs included a social enterprise investor. As such, it appears that there is only moderate evidence for SIBs to be considered an innovative financial mechanism, with more support for US SIBs. Moreover, it remains to be seen if a broad cross section of private and social sector investors will use SIBs to increase their contribution to the production of social goods, as the diversity of investors in the US is not replicated in the UK, where one investor (Bridges) invested in almost half of the SIBs. We also found that the use of SIBs in the UK is much more likely to be driven by public sector investment than philanthropic investment as in the US. Out of the 47 UK SIBs, 24 were purportedly launched as part of a broader SIB funding agenda at the UK national government level. For example, “The UK Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) commissioned ten Social Impact Bonds under the innovation fund, to pilot social investment and new delivery models” (Social Finance, 2018). Conversely, none of the US SIB profiles mention such coordinated funding initiatives. However, in prior research, Fry (Reference Fry2019: 788) found that “federal support of PFS [pay-for-success] was a major catalyst for PFS diffusion” in the US – for instance, through the Social Innovation Fund and the 2018 Social Impact Partnerships to Pay for Results Act. Nonetheless, our findings conform with earlier research that the UK is taking more of a centralized approach to implementing SIBs than the US (Heinrich and Kabourek, Reference Heinrich and Kabourek2019), with the government providing higher amounts of support and subsidies (Williams, Reference Williams2020). Second, this study also tested how SIBs can accelerate the process of social innovation through piloting and scaling. We found that both the UK and the US are creating fewer SIBs at the earlier stage of the process (i.e. during the pilot phase), where more policy experimentation is likely to happen. Instead, they appear to be funding relatively more programs that scale up previously proven interventions. In contrast to the UK where about a third of SIBs are small-scale pilots, in the US, testing for the efficacy of promising programs at scale is the dominant feature of the US SIB market. Thus, we also found minimal evidence that SIBs support the entirety of the social innovation process, as this support primarily took place during the scaling stage. Additionally, SIBs in the US are generally employing more rigorous evaluation methods than in the UK. In examining the language contained within the SIB profiles, only nine (19 percent) UK SIBs and seven (32 percent) US SIBs mentioned conducting an RCT or comparing outcomes with a comparison group, control group, or historical baseline. Notably, the only three programs which specifically mentioned the use of an RCT were from the US. In part, this is due to the scale of the SIBs in the US, but many of the larger SIBs in the UK also do not employ rigorous evaluation methodologies. Therefore, increasing the use of rigorous evaluations in both countries, but especially the UK, is an area of potential emphasis in the future (Albertson et al., Reference Albertson, Bailey, Fox, LaBarbera, O’Leary and Painter2018). Additionally, in the US, nine out of the 22 SIBs state that they are the “first” to implement a SIB within some unique context, suggesting that the US is still piloting the SIB tool as a social innovation itself. Thus, it is likely that we will see further developments in how the US uses SIBs in the future. Third, as highlighted throughout our analysis, we found notable differences between the use of SIBs in the UK and the US; overall, the analysis showed that early UK SIBs tend to be much smaller than US SIBs, and tend to have more social investors compared to private investors in the US, conforming with earlier findings (Painter et al., Reference Painter, Albertson, Fox and O’Leary2018; Gustafsson-Wright et al., Reference Gustafsson-Wright, Gardiner and Putcha2015). These trends reflect the differing impetus behind SIB adoption in the two countries. As explained by Albertson et al. (Reference Albertson, Bailey, Fox, LaBarbera, O’Leary and Painter2018), the primary driver of SIBs in the UK was public sector demand for the subcontracting of existing services; UK SIBs intended to encourage new entrants into service delivery in order to increase competition and reduce costs, partly requiring experimentation (Albertson et al., Reference Albertson, Bailey, Fox, LaBarbera, O’Leary and Painter2018). Meanwhile, the primary driver of SIBs in the US was private sector supply of innovative social services, with US SIBs responding to the “large, and unmet, demand for funding sources that can support transformation in social service delivery”, especially in scaling previously proven interventions (Albertson et al., Reference Albertson, Bailey, Fox, LaBarbera, O’Leary and Painter2018: 104). Fourth, as previously mentioned, there was very limited evidence in the database to suggest that SIBs also work to include co-productive elements or have an explicit orientation for diffusion. While language describing the SIBs did not mention co-production or co-creation explicitly, some did include language suggesting the personalization of services. For example, 31 SIB profiles mentioned providing one-on-one, holistic, personalized, bespoke, tailored, intensive and/or wrap-around support to respond to individual needs. The vast majority of these (25) were in the UK, including six funded through the Innovation Fund and five funded through the Fair Chance Fund. However, the Database language was vague and did not go further to discuss specific co-production strategies. The most information that a profile offered on potentially co-productive strategies was the UK’s end of life care program launched in September 2018, which stated that it collected “feedback from carers and families on their experience of the service.” Similarly, only seven profiles of UK SIBs financed through the Fair Chance Fund used explicit diffusion-related language, stating that their “findings will inform policy direction.” Additionally, a couple of larger-scale SIBs within the Database hinted at possible diffusion into wider systems. The Green Infrastructure program in Washington D.C. has the longest duration (30 years) of all programs as well as very large values of capital raised ($25 million) and maximum outcome payments ($28.3 million). It is the only US SIB to address poverty and the environment, and promotes wider systems change by reducing pollution to improve water quality, as well as by reinvesting all SIB proceeds into additional green infrastructure projects.Footnote 5 Finally, it is important to note that by focusing on the piloting and scaling stages as well as on the role of private sector funding within SIBs, our analysis aligns more with the technocratic or utilitarian paradigm of social innovation, omitting the more democratic or radically-oriented elements such as co-production (Montgomery, Reference Montgomery2016; Ayob et al., Reference Ayob, Teasdale and Fagan2016). Further, although this paper found relatively little evidence that early-wave SIBs in the US and UK displayed socially innovative characteristics, findings might also suggest “a flaw in the design of SIBs” (Albertson et al., Reference Albertson, Fox, O’Leary and Painter2020: 7) which social innovation theory (including the radical paradigm) could help address by guiding the continued evolution of SIBs.",innovative shipping solutions investment

Program Purpose

The Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1998 (TIFIA) will provide Federal credit assistance to major transportation investments of critical national importance, such as intermodal facilities, border crossing infrastructure, expansion of multi-State highway trade corridors, and other investments with regional and national benefits. The TIFIA credit program is designed to fill market gaps and leverage substantial private co-investment by providing supplemental and subordinate capital. [1503]

Program Products

The TIFIA credit program consists of three distinct types of financial assistance (product lines), designed to address projects varying requirements throughout their life cycles:

Secured loans are direct Federal loans to project sponsors offering flexible repayment terms and providing combined construction and permanent financing of capital costs.

are direct Federal loans to project sponsors offering flexible repayment terms and providing combined construction and permanent financing of capital costs. Loan guarantees provide full-faith-and-credit guarantees by the Federal government to institutional investors such as pension funds which make loans for projects.

provide full-faith-and-credit guarantees by the Federal government to institutional investors such as pension funds which make loans for projects. Standby lines of credit represent secondary sources of funding in the form of contingent Federal loans that may be drawn upon to supplement project revenues, if needed, during the first 10 years of project operations.

The amount of Federal credit assistance may not exceed 33 percent of total project costs. [1503]

Funding

A total of $530 million of contract authority is provided to pay the ""subsidy cost"" of supporting Federal credit under TIFIA, that is, to cover projected losses. Annual caps totaling $10.6 billion limit the nominal amount of credit instruments issued. [1503, TRA 9007]

Eligible Activities

Any type of project that is eligible for Federal assistance through surface transportation programs under Title 23 or chapter 53 of Title 49 U.S.C. (highway projects and transit capital projects) is eligible for the TIFIA credit program. In addition, the following types of projects are eligible: international bridges and tunnels; inter-city passenger bus and rail facilities and vehicles (including Amtrak and magnetic levitation systems); and publicly owned intermodal freight transfer facilities (except seaports or airports) on or adjacent to the National Highway System. [1503]

Each project must meet certain objectively measurable threshold criteria to qualify: it must cost at least $100M million or 50% of the States annual apportionment of Federal-aid funds, whichever is less. (For intelligent transportation system projects, the minimum cost is $30M.) The project also must be supported in whole or in part from user charges or other non-Federal dedicated funding sources and be included in the States transportation plan. [1503]

Qualified projects meeting the initial threshold eligibility criteria will be evaluated by the Secretary and selected based on the extent to which they generate economic benefits, leverage private capital, promote innovative technologies, and meet other program objectives. Each project must receive an investment grade rating on its senior debt obligations before its Federal credit assistance may be fullyfunded. [1503]

UNB's McKenna Institute announces $1-million Rural Strategy ...,https://blogs.unb.ca/newsroom/2024/06/digital-transformation.php,23 часа назад,"Author: UNB Newsroom

Posted on Jun 12, 2024

Category: Press Releases

The McKenna Institute at the University of New Brunswick (UNB) is thrilled to announce the Rural Strategy for Digital Transformation that will accelerate New Brunswick’s digital economy. This strategy is made possible by a $1 million investment led by the River Philip Foundation.

The McKenna Institute’s Rural Strategy for Digital Transformation aims to bridge the rural-urban divide in New Brunswick’s digital economy. The strategy proposes initiatives to increase digital adoption, public engagement and support for New Brunswick’s rural communities and smaller centres through skills development, digitalization initiatives and partnerships.

The strategy also aims to provide best practices to employers, organizations, and individuals on how to thrive in a digital interconnected economy and to lead the digital transformation in their communities.

“Since its founding, the McKenna Institute’s mandate has been to build a robust talent pipeline for all of New Brunswick,” said Hon. Frank McKenna, Founder of the McKenna Institute. “Thanks to this incredible contribution led by the River Philip Foundation, we are able to build our strategy and deliver digital opportunities to our rural communities and smaller centres.”

Over three years, the $1 million investment from the River Philip Foundation will establish the groundwork for the strategy to continue long-term. This will include science, technology, engineering, art and mathematics (STEAM) scholarships for rural areas, support for delivery partners, and community engagement events. The investment marks a significant step forward for the support of rural communities in New Brunswick.

“We are proud to make this investment,” says John Bragg, Founder of the Bragg Group and Board Member of the River Philip Foundation. “We come from humble beginnings and are deeply rooted in rural communities. It has been our mission through the Foundation to make a difference in the lives of rural Maritimers. If we can help provide opportunities that reduce social, economic and civic challenges, then we are accomplishing something important because ultimately it improves quality of life and strengthens our rural communities and their ability to retain and attract people who want to live and work here.”

In addition to the generous commitment from the River Philip Foundation, EY Canada will support the strategy with an in-kind donation as part of their Ripples Program, which connects EY people and their skills, experience and passions to not-for-profits and social enterprises to help deepen their impact on the lives of young people and underserved groups to create an equitable, sustainable future for all. With the help of this contribution, the McKenna Institute will lead a data collection and asset mapping exercise to identify the regional challenges and how technology can contribute to the local economic growth.

Through a series of engagements, the Rural Digital Transformation Strategy will reflect the unique needs of rural New Brunswick and its smaller centres. These engagements will involve a variety of community partners and agencies that will bring in diverse perspectives to build the strategy. This work will result in a comprehensive data set for the digital divide challenges facing New Brunswick communities.

""We are excited to be a part of this strategy that will provide important new opportunities for New Brunswick,” said Paul J. Mazerolle, President and Vice-Chancellor of UNB. “The investment by the River Philip Foundation will have a substantial and significant impact on providing education and support to rural communities.”

The strategy also addresses advocating for investments in internet infrastructure to help promote digital work solutions. Improved connectivity, including 5G and satellite internet, can support remote work; population attraction and retention; promote digital work solutions; and reduce the dependence on physical transportation.

Transportation,https://www.ncpc.gov/topics/transportation/,N/A,"Highlight: Transportation Element Update

At its July 9, 2020 meeting, the Commission adopted an updated Transportation Element, an addendum, and corresponding updates to the agency’s Submission Guidelines. Last updated in 2016, the element contains policies that the Commission uses when evaluating transportation components of projects and plans that affect federal buildings, installations, parks, and campuses.



Differences from 2016 include a revised parking space to employee ratio in the L’Enfant City (Washington’s central core) from 1:5 to 1:6; standardizing the process to allow deviations from parking ratios for proposed projects at federal facilities; and encouraging agencies to charge for parking (where permissible). As part of the update, NCPC developed a new internal monitoring process to assess Transportation Demand Management performance at federal worksites. This monitoring process will allow agencies to adjust their strategies as needed to improve performance over time and will share this information with NCPC.



The addendum describes NCPC requirements for Transportation Demand Management and Transportation Management Plans and explains key concepts. The agency’s submission guidelines assist applicants in better understanding NCPC’s project and plan review process. The updated policies will go into effect 60 days after the publication of the Federal Register notice about the Commission’s adoption of the element. Individual projects already under NCPC review would be assessed using criteria from the 2016 element.

eBay fulfilment uk

As an eBay seller based in the UK, efficient fulfilment is crucial for ensuring customer satisfaction and maintaining a competitive edge in the ever-evolving e-commerce landscape. In this comprehensive guide, we delve into the intricacies of eBay fulfilment in the UK, exploring various options, services, and strategies to help you streamline your operations and deliver a seamless shopping experience to your customers.

We understand the challenges that come with managing inventory, processing orders, and shipping products promptly. By leveraging the right fulfilment solutions, you can alleviate these burdens, freeing up valuable time and resources to focus on growing your business. Whether you’re a seasoned eBay seller or just starting out, this guide will equip you with the knowledge and tools necessary to navigate the world of eBay fulfilment in the UK successfully.

To enhance the capabilities of eBay sellers based in the UK, Post & Packing UK offers bespoke services that include parcel collection, secure storage, and professional packing tailored to the specific needs of online retailers. This complements the general insights into eBay fulfillment, providing sellers with practical solutions to manage their operations more effectively.

Understanding the importance of fulfilment for eBay sellers

In the fast-paced realm of e-commerce, fulfilment plays a pivotal role in determining the success of an eBay business. Efficient fulfilment not only ensures timely delivery of orders but also contributes to customer satisfaction, retention, and ultimately, your bottom line. By providing a seamless and hassle-free shopping experience, you can cultivate a loyal customer base and foster positive reviews, which are invaluable assets in the competitive eBay marketplace.

Moreover, with the rise of consumer expectations and the increasing demand for faster shipping times, having a robust fulfilment strategy has become a necessity rather than a luxury. Failure to meet these expectations can lead to dissatisfied customers, negative feedback, and potential loss of sales. By prioritising an exceptional fulfilment service, you can stay ahead of the competition and position your eBay business for long-term success.

Recognising the importance of timely delivery, Post & Packing UK’ global shipping programme also facilitates fast and reliable shipping options. Our services help ensure customer satisfaction and retention by providing more control over the logistics process, thereby supporting the core objectives of eBay sellers aiming for operational excellence and customer loyalty.

Exploring different fulfilment options in the UK

As an eBay seller in the UK, you have access to a range of fulfilment options, each offering unique advantages and catering to different business needs. Let’s explore some of the most popular choices:

1. In-house fulfilment: This approach involves handling all aspects of fulfilment within your own premises, including storing inventory, picking and packing orders, and arranging shipping. While this method offers complete control over the process, it can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, especially as your business scales.

2. Third-party fulfilment services: By outsourcing fulfilment to specialised companies, you can offload the logistical burden and focus on other aspects of your business. These services typically offer features like inventory management, order processing, and shipping, allowing you to streamline your operations and ensure timely deliveries.

3. eBay’s Global Shipping Program: eBay’s Global Shipping Program (GSP) is a convenient option for sellers looking to expand their reach internationally. By leveraging eBay’s network of fulfilment centres, you can ship your products to a designated location, and eBay will handle the international shipping and customs clearance processes.

Each fulfilment centre and option has its own set of advantages and considerations, and the choice ultimately depends on factors such as the size of your business, the volume of orders, and your operational resources.

For those eBay sellers considering various fulfillment methods, Post & Packing UK offers a hybrid solution that combines the benefits of in-house control with the efficiency of third-party expertise. This includes access to our network of fulfillment centers across the UK, providing a strategic advantage in terms of product distribution and logistics management.

How to contact eBay customer service for fulfilment-related queries

While navigating the world of eBay fulfilment, you may encounter situations where you require assistance or have specific queries. In such cases, it’s essential to know how to reach out to eBay’s customer service team effectively. Here are a few convenient options:

1. Online support: eBay offers a comprehensive online support centre where you can find answers to frequently asked questions, troubleshoot issues, and submit inquiries through a user-friendly interface.

2. Phone support: For more urgent or complex matters, you can contact eBay’s customer service team directly via phone. The dedicated phone numbers for sellers in the UK are readily available on eBay’s website.

3. Community forums: eBay’s vibrant community forums are a valuable resource for seeking advice, sharing experiences, and engaging with other sellers who may have faced similar fulfilment challenges.

Beyond contacting eBay for fulfillment queries, Post & Packing UK’s customer service provides dedicated support for fulfillment operations, offering guidance and solutions tailored to the unique challenges faced by eBay sellers. This can be particularly useful for those looking to streamline their shipping and handling processes.

Leveraging eBay’s local warehouses in the UK

For eBay sellers based in the UK, one of the advantages is the availability of eBay’s local warehouses strategically located throughout the country. These warehouses serve as fulfilment centres, enabling faster and more efficient order processing and delivery within the UK. By utilising eBay’s local warehouses, you can benefit from reduced shipping times, lower costs, and improved customer satisfaction. Additionally, these warehouses often offer specialised services such as inventory management, product inspection, and returns handling, further streamlining your fulfilment processes. To take advantage of eBay’s local warehouses in the UK, you’ll need to meet certain eligibility criteria and follow the specified guidelines. However, the benefits of leveraging these facilities can be substantial, particularly for sellers with a significant volume of orders within the UK market.

In addition to using eBay’s local warehouses, sellers can benefit from Post & Packing UK’s various locations for drop shipping services. This alternative or additional option can help optimize inventory management and reduce delivery times, enhancing overall operational efficiency.

Understanding the fulfilment fee structure on eBay

When it comes to eBay fulfilment, it’s essential to understand the associated fee structure to ensure profitability and make informed decisions. eBay’s fulfilment fees are designed to cover the costs of storing, handling, and shipping your products, and they can vary based on factors such as item weight, dimensions, and shipping destination.

To help you navigate the fee structure, eBay provides detailed information and fee calculators on their website. These tools allow you to estimate the fulfilment costs for your products, enabling you to factor them into your pricing strategies and maintain competitive pricing.

Additionally, it’s crucial to stay up-to-date with any changes or updates to eBay’s fulfilment fee structure, as these can impact your overall profitability and operational costs. By understanding and accounting for these fees, you can make informed decisions and optimise your fulfilment processes for maximum efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

While eBay’s fee structures are a crucial consideration, Post & Packing UK can offer competitive pricing for storage and fulfillment services, which might provide more transparent and predictable costs, helping eBay sellers manage their budget more effectively.

Managing and fulfilling eBay orders in the UK

Efficient order management and fulfilment are critical components of a successful eBay business in the UK. By streamlining these processes, you can ensure timely delivery, minimise errors, and enhance customer satisfaction.

One effective approach is to leverage eBay’s order management tools, which provide a centralised platform for tracking and managing your orders. These tools allow you to monitor order statuses, update tracking information, and communicate with customers seamlessly.

Additionally, integrating your eBay account with a reliable fulfilment service or warehouse management system can significantly simplify the order fulfilment process. These solutions automate tasks such as order processing, inventory management, and shipping label generation, reducing the risk of errors and improving overall efficiency.

It’s also crucial to establish clear standard operating procedures (SOPs) for order fulfilment within your team. These SOPs should outline best practices for tasks such as picking, packing, and shipping, ensuring consistency and minimising delays or mistakes.

By implementing robust order management and fulfilment strategies, you can create a seamless and efficient experience for your customers, ultimately contributing to the growth and success of your eBay business in the UK.

To complement eBay’s order management tools standard delivery side, Post & Packing UK offers integration services that link directly with eBay platforms, streamlining the order fulfillment process from inventory management to final dispatch. This helps ensure that sellers can maintain high standards of customer service and operational efficiency.

Evaluating the benefits of Orange Connex Global for international shipping

While Orange Connex offers exceptional fulfilment services within the UK, their Global solution extends their capabilities to international markets.

Exploring alternative fulfilment options like One World Express

While Orange Connex is a prominent fulfilment service provider for eBay sellers in the UK, it’s always prudent to explore alternative options to ensure you find the best fit for your business needs. One such alternative is One World Express, a reputable ebay fulfilment services company with a strong presence in the UK and global markets.

One World Express offers a comprehensive range of fulfilment services, including inventory management, order processing, and shipping. They have a network of strategically located warehouses and partnerships with major carriers, ensuring efficient and timely delivery of your eBay orders.

Analysing the cost implications of eBay fulfilment for sellers

While efficient fulfilment is crucial for the success of your eBay business, it’s essential to carefully analyse the associated costs to ensure profitability and make informed decisions. The cost implications of eBay fulfilment can vary depending on factors such as the fulfilment method chosen, the volume of orders, and the shipping destinations.

If you opt for in-house fulfilment, you’ll need to consider costs such as warehouse or storage space, labour, packaging materials, and shipping expenses. These costs can quickly add up, especially as your business grows, and may require significant upfront investments.

On the other hand, outsourcing fulfilment to third-party services like Orange Connex or One World Express can provide cost savings through economies of scale and streamlined processes. However, you’ll need to factor in their service fees, which may vary based on the specific services you require and the volume of orders.

Additionally, it’s crucial to consider the potential cost implications of inefficient fulfilment, such as lost sales due to delays, negative customer reviews, and increased returns or exchanges. These indirect costs can significantly impact your bottom line and should be carefully evaluated.

By conducting a thorough cost-benefit analysis and weighing the various fulfilment options available, you can make informed decisions that optimise your operational costs while maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction and overall profitability.

Understanding cost implications is critical, and Post & Packing UK provides detailed consultations to help eBay sellers analyze their fulfillment expenses. Our aim is to offer cost-effective solutions that do not compromise on service quality, aligning with the financial goals of eBay sellers.

Leveraging UPS Access Point for convenient and efficient shipping

In the realm of eBay fulfilment in the UK, leveraging innovative shipping solutions can significantly enhance the customer experience and streamline your operations. One such solution is UPS Access Point, a convenient and efficient delivery option offered by UPS.

UPS Access Point allows your customers to have their eBay orders delivered to a nearby UPS Access Point location, such as a local convenience store or petrol station. This provides added flexibility and convenience for customers who may not be available to receive packages during regular delivery hours or prefer to pick up their orders at a location that suits their schedule.

By integrating UPS Access Point into your fulfilment strategy, you can offer your customers greater control over the delivery process and reduce the likelihood of failed or missed deliveries. This not only enhances customer satisfaction but also minimises the need for costly redelivery attempts or returns.

Additionally, UPS Access Point can streamline your fulfilment operations by reducing the number of individual delivery stops and optimising delivery routes. This can lead to increased efficiency, cost savings, and a reduced carbon footprint, aligning with sustainability initiatives.

To leverage UPS Access Point effectively, you’ll need to ensure seamless integration with your eBay account and fulfilment processes. By partnering with reputable fulfilment service providers or leveraging eBay’s shipping tools, you can seamlessly offer this convenient shipping option to your customers.

For those utilizing UPS Access Point, Post & Packing UK can facilitate integration with this service, providing additional convenience for eBay sellers and their customers. This includes managing drop-offs and pickups at designated locations, further simplifying the fulfillment process.

Ensuring on-time delivery for eBay orders in the UK

In the competitive world of e-commerce, timely delivery is paramount for maintaining customer satisfaction and fostering brand loyalty. As an eBay seller in the UK, ensuring on-time delivery should be a top priority to provide an exceptional shopping experience and cultivate a positive reputation.

One effective strategy is to leverage reliable and reputable shipping carriers with proven track records of on-time performance. By partnering with carriers like Royal Mail, DPD, or UPS, you can benefit from their extensive delivery networks and efficient logistics operations, increasing the likelihood of timely deliveries.

Additionally, it’s crucial to optimise your fulfilment processes to minimise delays and bottlenecks. This may involve streamlining order processing, implementing efficient picking and packing procedures, and integrating with advanced warehouse management systems to ensure orders are promptly and accurately fulfilled.

Providing customers with clear and accurate delivery estimates is also essential. By leveraging eBay’s shipping tools and integrating with your fulfilment service provider’s systems, you can provide customers with realistic delivery timeframes, setting appropriate expectations and reducing the potential for disappointment.

Furthermore, monitoring and analysing your delivery performance data can help identify areas for improvement and proactively address any recurring issues. By continuously optimising your fulfilment strategies and processes, you can consistently deliver eBay orders on time, fostering customer trust and loyalty.

Post & Packing UK further supports eBay sellers by ensuring on-time delivery through our network of reliable courier services and efficient logistical support. By partnering with us, eBay sellers can leverage our expertise in managing timely dispatches and maintaining consistent delivery schedules, which are essential for building customer trust and enhancing seller ratings on eBay.

Exploring automated solutions for eBay fulfilment

As your eBay business grows and order volumes increase, manual fulfilment processes can become increasingly time-consuming and prone to errors. To maintain efficiency and scalability, exploring automated solutions for eBay fulfilment can be a game-changer. Automated fulfilment systems leverage advanced technologies such as robotics, conveyor systems, and intelligent software to streamline various aspects of the fulfilment process. These solutions can automate tasks like inventory management, order picking, packaging, and even shipping label generation, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention.

One of the key benefits of automated fulfilment is increased accuracy and consistency. By minimising human error, automated systems can improve order accuracy, reduce mispicks, and ensure consistent packaging and labelling standards. This not only enhances customer satisfaction but also minimises the costs associated with returns and exchanges.

Additionally, automated fulfilment solutions can significantly improve operational efficiency and throughput, enabling you to process a higher volume of orders in a shorter time frame. This scalability is crucial for eBay sellers experiencing rapid growth or seasonal spikes in demand.

While implementing automated fulfilment solutions may require an initial investment, the long-term benefits in terms of increased productivity, reduced labour costs, and improved customer satisfaction can outweigh the upfront costs, particularly for high-volume eBay sellers.

By embracing innovative and automated fulfilment solutions, you can position your eBay business for sustained success in the dynamic and competitive UK e-commerce market.

"City previews ""Accessibili-D,"" a free autonomous vehicle ...",https://detroitmi.gov/news/city-previews-accessibili-d-free-autonomous-vehicle-shuttle-residents-age-62-andor-disabilities,1 день назад,"The Accessibili-D autonomous shuttle pilot will launch June 20th for older Detroiters and residents with disabilities. The service is free for eligible riders and will run through 2025

Initial route will include 68 stops, cover an 11-square-mile area in southeast area of city

Pilot is a collaboration between the City’s Office of Mobility Innovation, the Michigan Mobility Collaborative, and May Mobility, supported by a $2.4 million contract and grants from the USDOT and philanthropic partners

Three autonomous vehicles, including two wheelchair-accessible ones, will offer scheduled and on-demand rides to essential destinations, bookable via a mobile app or phone number , with operational hours spanning weekdays and weekends. Eligible residents must complete an Expression of Interest form to sign-up.

, The project includes extensive community engagement and safety testing, with plans to expand based on rider feedback and continuous data analysis

Mayor Duggan joined city officials, project partners and press to preview the ""Accessibili-D"" autonomous shuttle service, an innovative initiative aimed at improving mobility for residents with disabilities and those aged 62 and older at no cost to eligible riders. This pilot program, a collaboration between the City of Detroit’s Office of Mobility Innovation (OMI), the Michigan Mobility Collaborative (MMC), and May Mobility, will launch on June 20, 2024, and run through 2025.

The ADS Shuttle program aims to help Detroiters aged 62 and older or living with disabilities reach essential destinations at no cost. The free shuttle service can be scheduled in advance or on-demand, picking riders up at designated stops and taking them to predefined destinations such as stores, doctor appointments, or social and recreational activities.

""Detroit is becoming a national leader in mobility innovation and there is no better use for these advancements than to make sure our most vulnerable residents have a safe and convenient way to access the goods and services they need for a good quality of life,” said Mayor Duggan. “This new shuttle has enormous potential to give older residents and those living with disabilities the ability to be self-sufficient.”

How the service works

This innovative pilot program pilot will launch on June 20, 2024.

The shuttle service will operate within an 11-square-mile area in southeast Detroit, covering 68 stops along a pre-programmed route. Three autonomous vehicles, including two that are wheelchair accessible, will be deployed. The service operates weekdays (except Tuesday) from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and weekends from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.

There will be a safety operator present at all times to assist riders with onboarding and offboarding, as well as address any issues that arise.

Riders will just need to get themselves to the closest stop on the route and then can be taken to any of the 68 locations on the Phase 1 pilot route and returned to their starting point. For convenience, several stops are located at multi-unit apartment buildings along the route.

Starting Thursday, June 20, Detroit residents interested in using the service must first:

Submit an Expression of Interest form and be contacted with instructions on how to enroll. Once enrolled, a ride may be scheduled in advance or on-demand in the following ways:

Website: detroitmi.gov/government/mayors-office/office-mobility-innovation/detroit-ads-self-driving-shuttles

Mobile app (Accessibili-D), available through Apple Store and Google Play. The app is available for download on Thursday, June 13.

Alternatively, riders can contact the May Mobility Detroit Office to book a ride at (734) 209-3408

“We're thrilled to launch the 'Accessibili-D' autonomous shuttle service, a vital step toward enhancing mobility for our older residents and those with disabilities. This free, innovative service will provide safe and efficient transportation, greatly improving access to essential services for residents who have faced difficulty navigating their needs in the city,” said Tim Slusser, chief of the Office of Mobility Innovation at the City of Detroit. “We are thankful for the expert collaboration of the institutions and individuals at the Michigan Mobility Collaborative and May Mobility for their invaluable partnership. We also extend our gratitude to our funders at the Knight Foundation and Delta Dental Foundation for their generous support. Together, we're making Detroit a more inclusive city for all.""

Last July, the Detroit City Council unanimously approved a $2.4 million contract with May Mobility to provide the shuttle service, originally expected to be operational by fall 2024. This decision followed 18 months of research and development, supported by grant funding from the United States Department of Transportation Autonomous Driving System Demonstration Grant and philanthropic partners, including the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Knight Foundation and Delta Dental Foundation.

“Many Detroiters have trouble getting around due to the costs of owning a car or mobility challenges arising from age or disabilities,” said Edwin Olson, CEO and co-founder of May Mobility. “We're excited to show how autonomous technology can help in Detroit, where we will be launching our largest service area to date.""

A Delta Dental Foundation (DDF) grant of $206,000 will directly fund a shuttle service to transport Detroit residents to specific dental clinics. One of the destinations will be the Detroit office of My Community Dental Centers (MCDC) at Samaritan Center, which currently serves several hundred patients who are older adults or have disabilities.

“Nationwide, transportation issues are one of the main barriers to underserved individuals getting to their preventive dental visits and completing their treatment plans. We are excited to collaborate with the City of Detroit on an innovative project which could have far reaching impact in helping people have optimal oral health,” said Holli Seabury, EdD, executive director of the Delta Dental Foundation.

Mayor Duggan joins city officials and project partners to celebrate preview event ahead the Accessibili-D autonomous shuttle pilot service launch on June 20.

Community Engagement

Since last fall, the project focused on community outreach, vehicle safety testing, and mobile application development. Throughout the pilot, data will inform the project’s scale and efficiency locally and potentially globally. Extensive community engagement will continue to build understanding of residents' needs regarding feasibility, access, and public safety, helping to expand public trust and understanding of these systems.

The MMC and May Mobility have engaged with the community to highlight the benefits of AVs and identify key locations in downtown Detroit that best serve users' needs. Based on rider feedback, plans are underway to expand the service zone with additional stops and vehicles. A second round of community engagement began last fall through spring 2024 to refine service routes for the pilot deployment on June 20, 2024.

Safety and Technology:

Extensive vehicle testing was conducted in partnership with the University of Michigan’s Mcity and the American Center for Mobility (ACM) to ensure the safety and reliability of the service. Testing protocols included the Mcity Safety Assessment Program and ACM's comprehensive evaluation process.

May Mobility’s AVs are equipped with cutting-edge Multi-Policy Decision Making (MPDM) technology. Using data gathered from lidar, radar, and cameras to provide a 360-degree view of the surroundings, this technology allows vehicles to simulate thousands of possible scenarios every second, ensuring safe and efficient navigation through Detroit’s streets, even in new situations.

The Detroit Autonomous Driving Systems pilot marks the 14th deployment for May Mobility, which currently operates in several locations across the United States, including Ann Arbor, MI; Grand Rapids, MN; Miami, FL; Arlington, TX; and Sun City, AZ.

The Michigan Mobility Collaborative (MMC):

The MMC, a public-private partnership, supports the development of mobility solutions for older adults and people with disabilities. The MMC will bring comprehensive technical support toward advancing the project’s three fundamental pillars: safety, data, and collaboration. Members include:

City of Detroit

AECOM

The American Center of Mobility (ACM)

Urbanite by Ford Motor Company

Deloitte

Knight Foundation

Mcity at the University of Michigan

Michigan Department of Transportation

River Severn Partnership wins national award,https://newsroom.shropshire.gov.uk/2024/06/river-severn-partnership-wins-national-award/,5 часов назад,"River Severn Partnership wins national award

The River Severn Partnership has been recognised for its exceptional work with an award at the LGC (Local Government Chronicle) Awards 2024.

The RSP won the public/public partnership category, which recognises organisations for demonstrating an innovative approach to service improvements, efficiency, and adding significant value to local communities. The LGC said entrants this year demonstrated outstanding practice as well as cutting-edge innovations, and the judges were very impressed with the extremely high standard.

Mark Barrow, co-chair of the RSP, said:-

“We are delighted the judges recognised the partnership for what it is, an excellent example of cross border, multi-agency working. “Since its inception the partnership, co-chaired by the Environment Agency and Shropshire Council, has been successful in attracting funding and is on course to make the Severn Catchment Britain’s most vibrant and resilient river network; where an exceptional quality of life, prosperous local economies and an outstanding natural environment is driven by a programme of innovation to reduce flood risk, secure future water resources and improve and deliver shared natural assets. “Working with one of our key long-term partners, ARUP – a global firm of specialists in environment, nature and water solutions who have brought their cutting-edge thinking for sustainable, climate-adaptive solutions, we benefit from their extensive range of relevant project experience to support the partnership in understanding and building resilience to flood risk, secure water resources, improving our shared natural assets and providing value to people and places. “We are also fortunate to be drawing on the expertise of UK Infrastructure Bank who are supporting us in developing innovative delivery approaches and strategic scale infrastructure projects to achieve our project goals.”

The River Severn Partnership is a multi-sector, cross-border collaboration designed to build resilience and prosperity for the 2.6 million people living within the Severn Catchment. Described by the Environment Agency as “an outstanding partnership,” it’s uniting partners across the Severn Catchment in England and Wales around an integrated approach to resilience in areas blighted by flooding.

Partners include Gloucestershire County Council, Herefordshire County Council, Powys County Council, Shropshire Council, Telford & Wrekin Council, Warwickshire County Council and Worcestershire County Council, Natural England, Natural Resources Wales, Homes England, Severn Trent Water, National Farmers Union, four local enterprise partnerships, local nature partnerships, wildlife trusts, and academic institutions such as Birmingham City University.

The judges said:-

“Congratulations to Shropshire Council, River Severn Partnership. An impressive and unique large-scale partnership that cuts across national, regional and local boundaries which will have huge impact for 2.6m residents. “The partnership truly does demonstrate the power in coming together and delivering beyond the capabilities of one partner alone, even with the challenges of working across different governance models and partner priorities. Turning the issue of flooding and climate change around to become an opportunity, rather simply a challenge, is really impressive.”

Mark added:-

“On behalf of the partnership I would like to thank the judges for their professional consideration and the LGC for organising and delivering another successful awards ceremony this year.”",innovative shipping solutions investment

Clorox Is Accelerating Innovation With Generative AI ...,https://consumergoods.com/clorox-accelerating-innovation-generative-ai-investment,3 дня назад,"âWe've never done anything that fast before, so we're excited about what this can mean."" - CEO Linda Rendle

The Clorox Company has been upfront about the work it is doing to recover distribution and gain back lost consumers after a cyber attack caused significant delays and challenges across its supply chain last year.

Now, as part of the companyâs digital transformation and personalization strategies to bolster operations and customer relationships, the company is looking toward generative AI .

Linda Rendle, CEO, recently detailed the strategy at the dbAccess Global Consumer Conference, and it is centered around expedited innovation with a use case-focused approach.

Clorox has invested in a generative AI innovation tool that identifies global trends so the company can quickly develop hundreds of digital prototypes at a time and test them with millions of consumers (instead of just 20 in a room as in the past).

The first innovation from these generative AI efforts launched this Spring, taking 90 days from start to finish.

âWe've never done anything that fast before, so we're excited about what this can mean,â said Rendle. âIt won't mean all innovation could go in 90 days. We have regulators to deal with and businesses need to go through processes, but to develop that funnel, know the consumer better, we are really excited about where this can take us.â",innovative shipping solutions investment
New York League of Conservation Voters and Sprague ...,https://nylcv.org/news/sprague-renewable-diesel/,16 часов назад,"RENSSELAER, NY – New York League of Conservation Voters and Sprague Operating Resources LLC hosted a press conference today to celebrate the availability of renewable diesel at the Sprague Fuel Terminal in Rensselaer, NY which will service trucking companies and wholesalers in the Upstate Region. Earlier this year, Sprague opened New York City’s first retail fuel station dispensing renewable diesel supplied from Sprague’s NYC Bronx Terminal.

Renewable diesel affords an immediate reduction of greenhouse gasses, particulate matter small particles, and NOx emissions. The transportation sector is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution in New York. Low-carbon fuel options for existing vehicles will immediately cut transportation emissions and help New York meet its bold climate goals.

Julie Tighe, President, New York League of Conservation Voters said:

“Today marks an important achievement in environmental progress as renewable diesel arrives at the Sprague Fuel Terminal in Rensselaer, NY, bolstering cleaner energy and public health in the Capital Region. This significant step forward, following Sprague Energy’s recent entry into renewable diesel retail with the Sonomax station in Brooklyn, underscores the urgent need to transition away from dirty fossil fuels to combat greenhouse gas emissions and toxic air pollution. While electrification efforts advance, embracing low-carbon fuel options like renewable diesel is crucial to meeting the State’s ambitious climate goals. We must ultimately implement a clean fuel standard to ensure widespread adoption and sustained investment in cleaner energy solutions.”

David Glendon, President and CEO, Sprague Operating Resources LLC said: “We are very excited to further expand our renewable fuel supply at the Sprague Rensselaer/Albany Terminal and look forward to helping propel adoption of renewable diesel in upstate New York and across our entire Northeast footprint. Sprague has over 150 years of experience helping our customers navigate these energy transitions, and we will continue to innovate and invest in cleaner fuels and sustainable solutions for all our valued customers and communities we serve to decarbonize.

Kendra Hems, President, Trucking Association of New York said: “The Trucking Association of New York congratulates Sprague Operating Resources for proactively taking this step toward a more sustainable future. The use of renewable diesel provides a pathway to greener transportation by providing an immediate reduction in carbon emissions without requiring a significant investment in new equipment. It is an important stepping stone toward reaching New York’s goal of reducing transportation related greenhouse gas emissions and supports the trucking industry’s commitment to reducing our carbon footprint.”

Kris DeLair, Executive Director, Empire State Energy Association said: “Renewable diesel provides us with yet another proven and affordable solution to significantly decarbonize both the transportation and heating sectors. Moreover, renewable diesel can seamlessly replace conventional diesel without requiring modifications to existing engines or fuel systems. I commend Sprague and all of our member companies for their forward-thinking approach and their steadfast dedication to protecting the environment and serving their customers. Their efforts exemplify the industry’s proactive stance in reducing emissions through the delivery and use of renewable liquid fuels. ESEA and its members are fully committed to leading New York State towards a greener, more sustainable energy future. We believe that through continued innovation.”

Barry Carr, Coalition Director, Clean Communities of Central NY said: “As Director of Clean Communities of Central NY; a US DOE Sanctioned Clean Cities and Communities Coalitions, we are excited Sprague Energy is bringing renewable fuels to Upstate NY. Our focus is on offering Clean Transportation options, and renewable diesel, made from waste products is a “drop in” fuel that can have immediate effects on emissions and offer an opportunity for fleets to immediately lower their carbon footprint.”

Jacob Beeman, Capitol Region Transportation Council said: “The Capital District Clean Communities Coalition is a U.S. Department of Energy designated coalition in the Clean Cities and Communities partnership. We are excited that Sprague Energy has made the commitment to bring renewable diesel to New York’s Capital Region. Our mission is to help fleets reduce dependence on petroleum resources and reduce transportation emissions in the Capital Region. Renewable diesel provides a direct low-emission alternative to traditional diesel without the need for costly fleet modifications or installation of fueling infrastructure.”

Jeffrey Palmerino, Teamsters Local 294 said: “We applaud Sprague for introducing renewable diesel to the Capitol District area to afford our members, their families and the upstate area to breathe cleaner air. These immediate emission reductions by this drop in fuel supports everyone to meet clean air goals today while we transition to other potential sustainable solutions in the future.”

Brian Brundige, Vice President of Operations, Terpening Trucking Company said: “Terpening Trucking Company has been serving New York and the surrounding states since 1916. With over 250 employees, including nearly 160 HazMat and TWIC certified truck drivers, we cover more than 7 million miles annually. A significant part of our business involves transporting various fuels, including renewable fuel. We are strong supporters of renewable diesel and the efficiencies they bring to today’s emission standards and beyond including reduced maintenance. Achieving fuel efficiency is essential to managing operational costs, and renewable fuels play a crucial role in enhancing these efficiencies while significantly reducing emissions and our carbon footprint.”

Greg O’Connor, President, Main-Care Energy said: “We are excited to partner with companies like Sprague Energy to offer Renewable Diesel, a reliable and affordable solution that meets tomorrow’s environmental goals today. Main Care’s commitment to the environment drives us to embrace low-carbon liquid fuels and power our delivery fleet with Renewable Diesel. We’re leading the way to achieve a lower carbon footprint while providing greater fuel efficiency in the communities we serve.”

Bob Long Jr., President, Long Energy said: “As a small business owner, my family is truly grateful that Sprague Energy has opened a pathway for us to bring to market renewable diesel. Although electrification may have its place in some instances, the access to renewable diesel is a game changer. Not only does it meet certain goals of decarbonization, but it also allows for consumer choice, competition, affordable energy solutions, reliability, and feasibility; all with no changes to existing equipment and infrastructure. No need to buy new fleets of trucks, or school buses, fire trucks, ambulances; its character is identical to Sprague’s diesel that we’ve trusted for so many years, without the carbon; and with renewable energy, we can heat homes and buildings cleaner and greener, without replacing entire systems. This fuel is an ideal fit for the state’s Clean Fuel Standard, and its inclusion to incentivize the demand is essential to establish a real and measurable impact on reducing air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.”

Greg Nido, President, Guy E. Nido Inc. said: “I’m very excited to offer renewable diesel to my customers. This is a great opportunity to reduce emissions while improving engine and boiler performance utilizing the cleaner non-fossil fuel. It’s exciting and am glad to be a part of the reduction of diesel emissions and partnering with Sprague.”",innovative shipping solutions investment
Plano-Based Zips Car Wash Soaks Up $70M Investment ...,https://dallasinnovates.com/plano-based-zips-car-wash-soaks-up-70m-investment-from-new-york-pe-firm/,3 дня назад,"Plano-Based Zips Car Wash Soaks Up $70M Investment From New York PE Firm Zips, the ""largest privately held car wash operator in the U.S.,"" moved its corporate office to Plano in 2020 to better support its expansion. Today, it boasts 280 locations across 25 states.

Plano-based Zips Car Wash has secured a $70 million investment from Atlantic Street Capital, a private equity firm known for its hands-on approach with lower middle-market companies. The capital infusion aims to support Zips’ operating strategy, enhance member experience, and improve wash quality, according to Atlantic Street Capital (ASC).



Zips describes itself as the “largest privately held car wash operator in the U.S.”

The company, which operates about 280 locations across 25 states under its Zips Car Wash, Rocket Express Car Wash, and Jet Brite Car Wash brands, has seen most of its growth in the past eight years through acquisitions and development, according to ASC. Zips partnered with PE firm in 2020, moving its corporate office to Plano to better support its growing portfolio and facilitate easier access to its expanding network of car washes.



“Express-only car wash chains are a great place to invest, yet face challenging consumer trends that need to be addressed by Zips and the industry at large,” ASC Managing Partner Andy Wilkins said in a statement. “This capital is critical for Zips’ efforts to think beyond existing industry strategies to accelerate growth, define membership experience, and capture retail attention.”

After its initial investment in 2020, Atlantic Street increased its investment in 2022 by acquiring additional equity from founding shareholders through a continuation fund, ASC noted.



Driving innovation under new leadership

Since Gene Dinkens was promoted to CEO of Zips Car Wash in October 2021, the company has been on an aggressive growth track. Dinkens, who joined Zips in May 2020 with over 30 years of experience in other industries, has leveraged best practices to significantly improve Zips’ business model and daily operations, according to CIOViews.

“We feel like we are in an excellent place right now to grow our brand exponentially with our newest technologies in place, to help us scale in size quickly and efficiently,” said Dinkens, as reported by CIOViews in 2022. Dinkens was one of the publication’s 10 “Most Innovative CEOs to Watch” that year.

Under his leadership, Zips has focused on innovation, including implementing advanced communication tools and industry-leading technology to enhance customer experience. Zips has standardized the look and feel of its car washes and added ceramic products to all sites in 2021, ensuring a consistent and high-quality experience across all locations whether in New Mexico or North Carolina, per CIOViews.



Celebrating two decades of suds and service

As Zips Car Wash marks its 20th anniversary this month, the company is launching several community initiatives. Customers can contribute to Folds of Honor, a charity supporting military families, by adding a donation to their car wash purchases. On key military holidays, Zips will donate an additional $1 for every new app download, according to a Zips news release.

Founded in 2004 with just two locations in rural Arkansas, Zips has grown exponentially, making it a dominant force in the car wash industry, according to the company. The company’s growth has been largely fueled by strategic acquisitions and development, making it a dominant force in the car wash industry. As a nod to its beginnings, Zips has “extended its anniversary celebration” with a $5 “Light Wash” wash at nearly all locations.

KRONOS Worldwide Improves Service And Reduces Costs ...,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebanker/2024/06/12/kronos-worldwide-improves-service-and-reduces-costs-with-managed-trans/,22 часа назад,"KRONOS produces titanium oxide. Titanium dioxide is a whitening and brightening agent KRONOS

Kronos Worldwide, headquartered in Dallas, is a leading global producer and marketer of titanium dioxide pigments used in a wide range of applications. The company has thousands of customers in over 100 countries. The titanium dioxide market has become far more competitive, and the industry is becoming commoditized.

While KRONOS (NYSE: KRO) was incorporated in 1989, the company's roots are over 100 years old. Over the years, individual locations—the company has several manufacturing locations in Europe and North America—have behaved increasingly autonomously. Autonomy led to a complex supply chain with shipments that traveled too many miles and required too many touches across the nodes. Their IT infrastructure was also highly heterogeneous and provided no standard business processes or real-time reporting. Meanwhile, customers’ procurement operations were seeing a new generation of talent come of age who were pushing for better value-added services and shipment visibility.

KRONOS Worldwide implemented SAP’s ERP to gain more central control and streamline operations. Memsud Musabasic, a director of global distribution, joined KRONOS in 2019 to support the objectives and leverage SAP to drive value across all supply chain layers including physical distribution network, planning and execution layers. Simplification and standardization were key to the strategy. Mr. Musabasic made the point that you could “forget about driving any kind of standard way of doing things without trying to simplify things first.” In logistics, simplification was supported by reducing the number of physical distribution nodes and improving the execution layer by adding a transportation management system and digitization in the form of better electronic connectivity to all partners across warehousing and transportation.

Unfortunately, SAP was implemented in a way that preserved the old fragmented operating process. Users continued to work as they always had and then input data into SAP. “SAP was acting as a recording tool,” Mr. Musabasic said. “We would never get value out of SAP that way! The system should drive the work.”

Often, when an ERP solution is implemented, the hard dollar savings do not come from finance, human resources, or customer relationship management solutions; they are generated by new efficiencies enabled in supply chain management. KRONOS examined whether it made sense to implement SAP’s TMS or work with a provider of managed transportation services.

Ultimately, they decided to work with Uber Freight. KRONOS felt Uber Freight had a best-of-breed TMS that Uber’s planners could use to plan and execute shipments on KRONOS's behalf. Uber was also making annual investments of about $120 million to continue to improve their TMS. And it was felt that the change management issues associated with getting the KRONOS site-level personnel to effectively use SAP’s TMS were just too difficult.

The new simplified SAP set-up and Uber Freight's managed trans services have driven significant benefits for KRONOS. Taking advantage of market conditions, double-digit percentage freight savings were generated in the first year after Uber negotiated new rates. In the following years, savings ranged from 4-5%. These savings are driven by the Uber planning team's professionalism and willingness to chase savings of as little as $20 per shipment, Uber’s ability to quickly put freight out to bid when rates or service levels change, and the simplified network and TMS optimization leading to more full truckload shipments.

There have also been customer service improvements. Prior to Uber Freight, KRONOS could not even measure customer service. Uber Freight procurement events now require that the selected carriers be able to provide visibility to shipment status. Carriers now must have MacroPoint or FourKites style visibility. And because transportation can never be perfect, when incidents do occur, KRONOS’s customers can be notified that a shipment will be late.

Visibility also promotes better revenue recognition as revenue is recognized when a container is loaded on a vessel. Prior to this, “chasing this down could take us days,” the director said. Finally, customers are increasingly requesting transportation emission data. Visibility also promotes this.

KRONOS also improved their warehouse operations based on managed trans fully connected to the ERP system together with a complete interface between the warehouse provider and ERP. This kind of digitization across the execution layer was key to streamlining operations and driving value from SAP.

Outsourcing to best of breed partners and allowing KRONOS to focus on its core competencies has driven significant value. Outsourcing required simplification and a clean core first and foremost. Mr. Musabasic’s final piece of advice is that a vested relationship is critical for a relationship to be as successful as what KRONOS and Uber Freight have achieved. A vested relationship is one in which benefits are shared, the outsourced service provider is trusted to make decisions, and there is full transparency to both what is working and what is not on the part of both partners.",innovative shipping solutions investment

"""An Evaluation of Innovative Transportation Financing ...",https://docs.lib.purdue.edu/jtrp/16/,Автор: K Drike,"Abstract

Innovative financing techniques can complement current methods of financing highway projects in Indiana. Annual federal apportionments and Indiana state revenues are not sufficient to maintain and improve state highways, so innovative approaches in transportation project financing should be sought. There are several available innovative financing techniques associated with the use of federal funds. Although, they do not provide new sources of revenue and cannot create enough funds for all identified projects, they provide flexibility in the use of available funds that can expedite the implementation of individual projects. The main objective of this study was to evaluate the major innovative financing techniques associated with federal funds, and their applicability for transportation projects in Indiana. The legal, financial, and operational issues of various alternatives were examined, and the economic impacts were investigated in terms of user benefits and debt service of the transportation agency. Possible revenue sources for debt service payment also were identified, and from a legal perspective, factors such as eligibility, authorization parties, and administration of financing assistance were addressed. Innovative financing techniques considered in the study include: the Test and Evaluation Project 045 (TE-045 program), Grant Anticipation Revenue Vehicle Bonds (GARVEE), the Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (TIFIA), and the State Infrastructure Bank (SIB). Four actual INDOT projects were used as case studies in the analysis. The study provides a framework for the evaluation of the use of innovative financing techniques described in this report. With detailed project specific data project-by-project analysis can be done to find the optimal solution for individual project financing.",innovative shipping solutions investment

Renewable Energy Fund: Innovative Finance for Clean ...,https://jointsdgfund.org/programme/renewable-energy-fund-innovative-finance-clean-tech-solutions-uruguay,N/A,"Challenge

Although the energy power matrix is ""clean"" in Uruguay, the country's primary energy matrix is still about 37% fossil fuel based. The industry and transportation sectors are still largely reliant on fossil fuels, emit a significant amount of carbon dioxide, and need a second energy transition to become clean industries. In this new decade, the Government of Uruguay aims to implement a second energy transition, which is seen as an opportunity and driver to achieve further economic and social development goals. The challenges are decarbonizing key economic sectors and improving the efficiency of the power system by accessing innovative technologies and affordable capital.

Innovation

The Programme seeks to support Uruguay’s 2nd energy transition by decarbonizing the industry and transportation sectors, securing universal access to renewable energy, and spurring innovation and competitiveness in the energy sector. The Renewable Energy Innovation Fund is a blended finance window for green transition projects coupled with a technical assistance facility. A Technical Assistance facility will also be created to support companies as they validate second energy transition technologies and innovative business models. Beyond Uruguay, this program will have a strong demonstrative effect on innovative financing for developing countries.

SDG Impact

This programme will improve Uruguay's environmental sustainability by helping deploy low carbon technologies and decarbonizing the industry and transportation sectors. It will also promote social and gender inclusivity, through increasing vulnerable groups' access to energy by improving connections, and women's participation in the renewable energy economy. Targets of the programme include: 101,122 GHG emissions reduced; achievement of 545% NDC commitments on electric buses and 91% in electric utility fleet; 5% energy-cost reduction in invested assets; 10% increase of women in managerial positions in invested assets; 99.9% of population with access to electricity; and 63% of renewable energy share in energy consumption.",innovative shipping solutions investment
Investing in Edmonton industrial real estate 101,https://renx.ca/investing-in-edmonton-industrial-real-estate-101,22 часа назад,"Edmonton, the land of roughnecks and public servants, tradies and tech geeks. It’s a city that can’t be defined as one thing, and doesn’t really want to be.

Diverse, entrepreneurial, steady Eddy, whose unique value proposition resides at the intersection between traditional and emerging sectors.

It’s no wonder that people are taking notice, and not just because of our soon-to-be Stanley Cup champions.

In today’s unpredictable markets, institutional investment has become more conservative. When analyzing commercial real estate opportunities this has opened the door for smaller, private entities which are more capable of taking risks, to take advantage in markets like Edmonton that are not fully understood.

For those that are comfortable with the fundamentals and flows of this market, investment opportunities are apparent.

Now for years, investors and economists have been the most bullish on multifamily and industrial, because the most attractive real estate is real estate that is needed, not wanted, particularly in our highly irregular markets of late.

Ultimately, real estate fundamentals are a reflection of labour and the consumer, and as markets veer from inflation to deflation, the changes in these interests directly trickle into brick and mortar demand.

For this article, I will skim over multifamily by saying I think it will be needed for years to come, and thus will remain a desirable investment asset for private and institutional players.

Diving deeper into industrial as an investment vehicle, the following article will address the Edmonton industrial landscape, its major industries and expected returns.

Understanding Edmonton's industrial landscape

The Edmonton Region is made up of 13 municipalities, 1.56 million residents, and stands out as the fifth-largest economy in Canada, due largely in part to its status as a thriving industrial hub in the resource-rich province of Alberta.

1) Northwest Edmonton: This varied submarket boasts a strategic location with easy access to major transportation routes. It is home to a wide range of industrial properties, including warehouses, distribution centres and manufacturing facilities. This quadrant intercepts the major east-west Highway 16, an important logistics corridor for the transportation industry.

Industrial Inventory: approximately 60 million square feet.

2) Southeast Edmonton: This well-diversified submarket features light industrial and flex spaces, technology and R&D zones, and manufacturing clusters with a growing distribution and transportation segment. Easy accessibility to the eastern refineries, northern highway corridors and southern distribution and air cargo nodes makes this a desirable quadrant for the large residential base inhabiting Edmonton’s south.

Industrial Inventory: approximately 55 million square feet.

3) Nisku/Leduc: Located in Leduc County and within the City of Leduc, this submarket for many years formed the foundation for the energy service, manufacturing and distribution sectors catering to the province’s northern engines. Today, this submarket remains a strong home base for industrial businesses directly, or indirectly, related to the oil and gas market but with a newfound identity as a major distribution hub for large-format, big-box names in north Nisku. Neighbouring the City of Edmonton to the south, and the Edmonton International Airport to the east, this is becoming a strategic location for many industrial businesses in the region.

Industrial Inventory: approximately 23 million square feet.

4) Acheson: Located in Parkland County to the west of Edmonton, this industrial park is one of the fastest-growing in the region, catering to a diversified mix of owner/operators in privately owned assets, to large manufacturers and household-name distributors. Solid transportation networks, rail connectivity and the region’s second lowest non-residential mill rate make this an enticing base for industrial businesses. Multiple large land development projects are underway to provide much-needed supply to an (approximately) one per cent vacancy submarket.

Industrial Inventory: approximately 11 million square feet.

5) Sherwood Park: Located in Strathcona County to the east of Edmonton, this is a tight industrial market occupied by light and medium industrial businesses within the hamlet and larger refinery and heavy industrial projects in the broader county. The county offers rail providers, high-load corridors, ample energy infrastructure, and extensive land opportunities. The hamlet provides a strong residential base and easy accessibility to the City of Edmonton while offering a preferential mill rate.

Industrial Inventory: approximately six million square feet.

6) Fort Saskatchewan and the Alberta Industrial Heartland: Known for its heavy industrial landscape, this region caters to large-scale oil, gas and energy projects that fuel the province and country. This submarket is serviced by both CN and CPKC rail lines, and is the doorway to the northern energy markets including Fort McMurray and Grande Prairie.

Top industries

Traditional and Clean Energy: Edmonton's industrial sector has historically been closely tied to the oil and gas industry, with many companies directly involved in exploration, extraction and refining operations, or supplementally involved through manufacturing, servicing and distributing operations. One of the most admirable features of this industry is the innovation and adaptability it shows to new market trends and fluctuations. To this end, many companies have traversed into alternate forms of energy production, storage and distribution in areas such as hydrogen, biofuels, carbon capture, solar, wind and nuclear.

Logistics and Transportation: The city's strategic location as a transportation hub makes it ideal for logistics and transportation companies who can take advantage of both CN and CPKC rail lines and intermodal yards, robust highway infrastructure connecting directly to the CANAMEX corridor and the largest air cargo facility by land mass in Canada with over $1.5 billion in on-airport development and over $300 million in new cargo development announced. Furthermore, Edmonton International Airport provides a less-congested, more efficient, inland port to Asian exporters, offering the full suite of necessary services to get goods where they need to be.

Manufacturing: Edmonton has always been a large player in the manufacturing industry for Western Canada with world-renowned expertise and innovation in energy-related operations. However, due to the city’s robust and highly educated skilled trades sector, the manufacturing industry is excelling in attracting new players to the market encompassing industries such as machinery, equipment, agritech and food processing. The emphasis on nearshoring and onshoring manufacturing activities from Asia back to North America has found solid footing in the Edmonton region due to the many intrinsic features of the market that are ingrained to support these initiatives.

Technology and Innovation: As Edmonton continues to diversify its economy, there is a burgeoning tech scene specializing in software development, life sciences, advanced manufacturing and machine learning. The University of Alberta ranks third in the world for artificial intelligence research and is home to Google Deep Mind’s first international location, attracting some of the world’s brightest to Edmonton. This identity of innovation runs through the Edmonton ecosystem and has led to innumerable trajectory-changing developments across all industries.

Factors influencing returns and pricing

Armed with a bit more information on the broader Edmonton industrial market, the next question leads into achievable returns and pricing in this market.

Compared to markets like Toronto and Vancouver, where industrial real estate prices are soaring largely due to massively constrained supply, Edmonton offers more affordable and attractive real estate opportunities for investors and owner/users alike. The economy is diversified and affordable, the location is strategic, serving as a transportation and logistics hub for Western Canada, and the market is stable, resilient and primed for growth.

Having said all this, and understanding that investment returns are both point-in-time, and consumer-driven, it’s impossible to outline achievable pricing metrics for all industrial real estate opportunities in Edmonton. Each sale is unique to the asset fundamentals, parties involved and macroeconomic factors of the day.

What I can say from a 10,000-foot view is Edmonton industrial cap rates typically range from six per cent to eight per cent; Edmonton industrial (serviced) land generally trades between $500,000 to $1 million per acre; and Edmonton industrial buildings predominantly sell between $100 to $200 per square foot.

If you are searching for more refined, specific values at the time of reading this, please reach out for an in-depth market and asset conversation.

Investing in Edmonton's industrial real estate market offers an array of opportunities for savvy investors.

With its diverse submarkets, thriving industries and strategic advantages, Edmonton stands out as a compelling destination for those seeking to capitalize on the dynamic landscape of industrial real estate in Canada and offers attractive returns and pricing relative to other Canadian markets.

Whether you're a seasoned investor, an operational industrial business or exploring new avenues for investment, Edmonton's industrial sector offers promising prospects for growth and profitability.",innovative shipping solutions investment

Integrating various advanced software and hardware technologies to provide a core product set of scheduling (TOS), fleet management (WellFMS), veriﬁcation & simulation (WellSimtec), prediction and recommendation (TerminalGPT).

Additionally, the REEWELL can holistically mobilize fleets and equipment within the logistics site to formulate the optimal route for vehicle movement. It allows unprecedentedly smooth, safe, and efficient transportation and makes fleet management easier than ever for operators.

The World’s First Green Transition Whitepaper Covering Multiple Logistics Nodes

The green transition of logistics needs to be progressed in a gradual and systematic approach, where strategic guidance and advanced production tools are of equal importance.

In this connection, Westwell worked with Roland Berger, one of the world’s top-level strategic management consulting firms, to introduce the world’s first methodology for green transition covering multiple logistics nodes—2024 Freight Logistics Decarbonization Whitepaper.

The core of the whitepaper lies in the “LEAD” decarbonization methodology. It states that based on Digitalization (D), the decarbonization process is divided into three phases: Electrification (E), AI-driven Intelligence (A), and Linked Ecology (L).

This whitepaper provides systematic guidance for industry professionals to achieve their Decarbonization goals and gain “Economical-Friendly”, “Environment Friendly”, “People Friendly” values (DEEP).

With regard to where the logistics industry will go, Westwell has provided insight in its “Ainergy” strategy, which encompasses practicable methods and a full suite of intelligent new-energy software and hardware products across all logistics scenarios.

Logistics professionals visiting Westwell’s stand at TOC Europe 2024 will have a better understanding of the path toward green and intelligent transformation, and will reap the benefits in the near future.",innovative shipping solutions investment
9 Trends Shaping The Future Of Sustainable Mobility,https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2024/feb/9-trends-shaping-future-sustainable-mobility.html,N/A,"Coordinating support from public and private spheres. Public funding is important — such as the European Union's Recovery Fund, which has allocated approximately $20 billion to boost the sales of electric vehicles — but won’t be enough on its own. Private corporations have a crucial role to play in driving innovation and bringing new technologies to support mobility to the market. Public-private partnerships have emerged as a valuable tool to bridge the gap between public funding and private sector expertise, fostering collaboration and accelerating progress. To guarantee a successful transformation of mobility, clear frameworks of risk allocation and support to innovation are necessary, also leveraging blended finance and other innovative financing schemes. Blended finance, such as the strategic use of public funds to attract private investors by reducing their risk exposure, is particularly impactful, as it lets investors with different risk tolerances participate in the same project. By working together, governments and private corporations can create a mobility ecosystem that is accessible, environmentally friendly, and capable of meeting the evolving needs of society.",innovative shipping solutions investment
Our Approach to Transport & Logistics Investment,https://stonepeak.com/investments/infrastructure/transport-logistics,N/A,"Changing consumption patterns

The increased complexity of inventory management and the growing reliance of society on e-commerce are creating opportunities to invest in the improvement and expansion of the global supply chain. Equally, the global energy transition has opened additional avenues for investment in LNG and clean fuels transportation to meet the increased demand for these sources of energy in markets around the world.

Deploying capital and technology to meet future expectations

We invest in support of businesses moving toward and benefiting from global thematic trends favoring more efficient and sustainable supply chains. Low-emission modes of transport such as rail and shipping will require additional investment to enhance their sustainability profiles, and infrastructure logistics operators and service providers will increasingly deploy advanced technologies to address complex problems such as efficient routing, energy and waste management, and space optimization.

Investing in strategically positioned assets worldwide

We seek out value among strategically advantaged businesses by investing in assets supported by uncorrelated macroeconomic demand drivers that we expect to outperform in a downturn. Our transport and logistics investments comprise approximately a quarter of our total investments, and to date have included mission-critical food and chemicals logistics infrastructure, transportation for the global energy transition, and opportunistic investments in certain sub-sectors such as aviation.

Opportunistically targeting the most attractive sub-sectors

Our thesis-driven approach to analyzing potential new opportunities allows us to identify what we believe to be the most compelling and emerging subsectors for investment. Across subsectors including last-mile logistics, aviation, or social infrastructure that is critical in supporting our collective well-being, we are thoughtful and highly selective in pursuing only those opportunities that we believe exhibit robust downside protection while benefiting from favorable trends.",innovative shipping solutions investment
Autonomous Shipping.,https://www.rotterdammaritimecapital.com/autonomous-shipping,N/A,"Financing is also crucial in making autonomous shipping a reality. Rotterdam is home to a variety of investment opportunities that sustain fundamental and practical research into autonomous shipping.

Rotterdam is proud to be associated with multiple examples of ground-breaking research milestones such as the collaboration between KOTUG, Rotortug, and tech company Captain AI, which operated a tugboat located in the port of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, remotely from Marseille, France. Or Shipping Technology’s installation and successful testing of semi-autonomous technology on board the 135-metre long inland shipping vessel Factofour. What about Seafar’s opening of a second control centre at the RDM Campus, from where it operates unmanned and crew-reduced vessels remotely?

Demcon Unmanned Systems is another example, having delivered fully-electric autonomous USVs (unmanned survey vessels) to carry out hydrographic survey operations in hard-to-reach bodies of water for Van Oord. Or the RPA 3, the Port of Rotterdam’s patrol vessel, equipped with cameras, measurement equipment and sensors. Also known as the ‘Floating Lab’, RPA 3 represents how the Port of Rotterdam is giving external partners the opportunity to test sensors, algorithms and/or other equipment in a simple, safe and efficient way.

Tackling future obstacles

The pilot projects taking place in and around Rotterdam are pushing the boundaries of autonomous technologies in the maritime sector. As such, Rotterdam is proving itself as an initiator of innovation. These projects are also exposing some of the key challenges that still need to be overcome in order to take autonomous shipping to the next step.

Safety

An autonomous ship has to be a safe ship. Whatever happens, it must stay afloat and not cause damage to third parties or the environment.

Legal issues

Insurance, risk assessment, responsibility and accountability: these are perhaps the most challenging obstacles related to autonomous shipping. Answering the question of ‘who is responsible if something goes wrong?’ is a critical point.

Data

Data exchange at sea is more complex than on shore (where there is WIFI and a mobile data network). Cyber security is another significant aspect.

International standards

The maritime industry is intrinsically international. Therefore, information needs internationally defined standards. Metres or inches? GMT or CET? This would need agreement from the 174 members of the International Maritime Organization.

Autonomous shipping will undoubtedly play a major role in the future of the maritime industry. Rotterdam is ready and more than able to collaborate with partners to facilitate this change and tackle these challenges. We are always looking for new partnerships, whether that is companies, knowledge institutes or government departments. Are you interested in working with us?

CargoSense Raises $8M in Series A Funding,https://www.finsmes.com/2024/06/cargosense-raises-8m-in-series-a-funding.html,22 часа назад,"CargoSense, a Reston, VA-based provider of a ‘Visibility OS’ platform for supply chain automation using visibility data, raised $8M in Series A funding.

The round was led by Lanza techVentures. Other investors included Merck Global Health Innovation Fund (MGHIF) along with SmoothBrain, channel partner The Pallet Alliance, and other previous private investors.

The company intends to use the funds to execute on expanding its partner ecosystem of integrated management systems, data sources, and industrial IIoT platforms available to digital agents running on the Visibility OS.

Founded in 2012 by CEO Richard Kilmer, CargoSense provides a Visibility OS for automating supply chain operations, enabling customers to get the full value of their visibility data to drive core systems and reduce the workloads of supply chain teams. It aims to simplify supply chain operations through measurement, automation, and collaboration.

Customers use the Visibility OS to get their supply chain systems – IIoT data sources, real-time transportation visibility platforms, risk analysis platforms, and the customer’s systems of record – all working as a unified stack through their customized digital agents running on the platform. This approach to integrations enables the automation of contextual analysis and execution across any supply chain function, and the operation of exception management workflows at scale.

CargoSense Raises $8 Million for Supply Chain Automation,https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2024/cargosense-raises-8-million-to-enhance-supply-chain-automation/,7 часов назад,"Supply chain automation firm CargoSense has raised $8 million in new funding.

The Series A round was led by Lanza techVentures and included participation from Merck Global Health Innovation Fund (MGHIF), according to a Wednesday (June 12) press release.

The company said the new funding will help it expand its partner network of integrated management systems, data sources, and industrial Internet of Things (IoT) platforms available to digital agents running on the CargoSense Visibility operating system.

“This will empower CargoSense’s global customers with the tools to automate and simplify additional aspects of their supply chain operations,” the company said in the release.

“The freight tech landscape continues to grow, and so have the complexities involved with incorporating new innovations into the technology stacks that supply chain teams depend on.”

Among those teams is one at pharmaceutical giant Merck, which worked with CargoSense to automate analysis of its parcel program to catch delivery problems in real time, and optimize decisions around distribution and packaging at the individual parcel level.

The results of this effort, the release said, led to the MGHIF investment in CargoSense to help automate supply chains throughout the pharmaceutical industry.

“Buyers of visibility data and related supply chain technologies for manufacturers and distributors all share an expectation: that it will reduce workloads for their supply chain teams,” said CargoSense founder and CEO Richard Kilmer.

“The reality is frequently the opposite, where there’s a large gap between new technology and their day-to-day operations, and people bridge the gap with additional manual effort and process complexity.”

PYMNTS looked at efforts to update supply chain models earlier this year, noting that they often rely on manual processes and disjointed communication, causing them to struggle to keep up with the demands of 2024’s dynamic markets.

“Recognizing this gap, businesses are increasingly turning to advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), automation and blockchain to transform and modernize every aspect of their supply chain processes,” that report said.

And in an interview with PYMNTS, GreyOrange CEO Akash Gupta shed light on how these advanced technologies, including robotics, AI and what he termed “an intelligent software orchestration layer,” have been instrumental in streamlining warehousing and fulfillment processes, while efficiently managing inventory flow and data.

He pointed to this company’s AI-driven platform, which he said models optimal decisions and outcomes to ensure seamless workflow management, and its single-view format for inventory nodes, providing visibility and control of the entire supply chain network.

“You’re getting a holistic view of what’s happening in the network,” Gupta said, “rather than looking at a bunch of Excel files … and it helps the interaction between sales managers and warehouse managers.”

MI's first phase,https://mission-innovation.net/about-mi/first-phase/,N/A,"MI’s first phase

Mission Innovation’s first 5 years Mission Innovation (MI) was announced at COP21 on November 30, 2015, as world leaders came together in Paris to commit to ambitious efforts to combat climate change.

The early goal

Accelerating clean energy innovation is essential to limiting the rise in global temperatures to well below 2˚C. The global community has made remarkable progress in driving down the costs and increasing the use of key clean energy options. However, these impressive gains are still insufficient to meet our long-term climate goals while providing affordable, reliable and secure energy supplies. In support of these efforts, members launched MI in 2015 with the following goal:

In support of economic growth, energy access and security, and an urgent and lasting global response to climate change, our mission is to accelerate the pace of clean energy innovation to achieve performance breakthroughs and cost reductions to provide widely affordable and reliable clean energy solutions that will revolutionize energy systems throughout the world over the next two decades and beyond.

– Enabling Framework for Mission Innovation

As part of the initial launch statement, members committed to:

Delivering the goal

MI followed an Action Plan created in 2017 (and an updated Action Plan developed in 2018) that set out four objectives to deliver the overall goal. By the end of 2020, MI helped deliver:

A substantial boost in public sector investment

In the first five years, Mission Innovation saw members increase their investments in clean energy innovation by USD $5.8 bn annually, representing a cumulative increase of USD $18 bn over the 5 years. During this period a number of countries doubled their MI related investments, including Canada, Chile, Japan, Netherlands, Norway and the UK.

Annual member updates : MI published an annual Country Book highlighting the strategies, activities and public-sector investments (including increments to MI baselines and progress towards the doubling commitment) implemented by members to advance clean energy innovation.

MI published an annual Country Book highlighting the strategies, activities and public-sector investments (including increments to MI baselines and progress towards the doubling commitment) implemented by members to advance clean energy innovation. Strengthened public and private sector RD&D data: MI members worked with collaborating organisations, including the IEA and IRENA, to strengthen the collection of data and to facilitate improved tracking of clean energy public sector and private sector RD&D investment data at a national and global level.

Increased private sector engagement and investment

The private sector plays a vital role in the commercialization and cost-effectiveness of clean energy breakthroughs. Entrepreneurs, investors and businesses drive innovation from the laboratory into the marketplace. Activities that MI and members undertook in its first phase to strengthen private sector engagement included:

The Global Cooling Prize , an innovation competition to develop a climate-friendly residential cooling solution that can provide access to cooling to people around the world without warming the planet.

Digital innovation in transportation infrastructure,https://digital.aecom.com/article/innovation_in_transportation_infrastructure/,N/A,"With many aspects of the nationâs infrastructure reaching the end of its as-designed life, and with the purchasing power of construction dollars continuing to be stretched, developing systematic processes for determining the most cost-effective infrastructure investment strategy is critical. At the same time consideration of life-cycle asset management is key to successful owner stewardship of public dollars.

We've adopted an integrated approach to best leverage the most current digital technology tools. The use of Building Information Modeling (BIM) for infrastructure, or what we call Civil Infrastructure Information Modelling (CIIM), is a key focal point in our engineering services delivery. CIIM provides enhanced design, cost, and operational certainty through 3D data models of intelligent components. Lessons learned from the vertical construction industry can be applied to horizontal construction. Adopting this technology for civil infrastructure is essential to moving forward.

Design certainty

3D technology and software have existed for decades. Introducing newer and more comprehensive technology provides enhanced design certainty (in particular for geometric aspects) on a project whether greenfield, brownfield, or existing conditions inventory and assessment. For example, BIM with LiDAR reality capture elevates the life-cycle management of the asset from the start. The next phases in this workflow - cost certainty and operational certainty â can be evaluated early and intelligently in the decision and analysis process. Geo-spatially referenced data capture of existing conditions and as-built geometry (via laser scanning and other methods) provides geometric accuracy and can provide component data for integration into the 3D data model, or what can be referred to as digital twin.

Cost certainty

The workflow for design and construction needs to support all stages of the asset management process: condition assessment and data capture, data analysis, deficiency identification, cost estimating, capital investment planning and project prioritization, and OPEX budget modeling. In the past, complex tasks like organizational and operational planning, space optimization, and climate change resilience were time consuming, but with digital innovations, can be achieved much more quickly with more in-depth analysis. Each of these variables can be connected to help inform capital project development and prioritization. Data mining schemes can provide outputs and relevant parameters can be selected to suit the needs of the owner. Providing the greatest level of interoperability between common data environment platforms for effective project collaboration and delivery is key.

Operational certainty

The benefits of an innovative approach that includes digital and cost certainty from project inception will allow for more informed operational planning and life-cycle costing and budgeting. Advanced CIIM facilitates the study of multiple operations and maintenance options quickly using real-world simulated influences to find the optimum solution. Systems coordination can be accomplished utilizing CIIM and can provide the ability to produce quantity surveys, takeoffs, and cost estimates at any time during the assetâs lifecycle, helping an owner track, analyze and forecast quantities and costs more effectively. BIM and CIIM centric approaches become the tie that binds. The digital collaboration of BIM and CIIM technology leaders, engineers, information technology specialists, systems and asset management analysts, constructors and operators, creates a holistic modelled system for reliable operational certainty of the infrastructure asset over the long term.

Innovative and advanced digital approaches for the inventory, planning, design, construction, and operations and maintenance of our infrastructure assets is essential. Digital AECOM is proud to be a leader in the adoption and use of these technologies along with industry partners and infrastructure owners, with the best interests of the travelling public and users in mind throughout.",innovative shipping solutions investment

Introduction

The continued population development in large cities has resulted in hefty traffic, which has become an essential concern regarding efficiency and environmental friendliness. Smart cities have gained popularity as a means of addressing these difficulties. An intelligent city employs cutting-edge technology to improve the quality of life for its residents by fostering a more efficient and sustainable environment. It is critical to deploy an Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) capable of efficiently controlling traffic flow and enhancing the overall transportation system. However, as the use of technology grows, so does the possibility of security risks, particularly in the case of ITS. Vehicles are vulnerable to various service assaults that might jeopardize security, posing a substantial barrier to the safe running of transportation networks. To overcome these problems, ITS standards like those developed in the United States and Europe have chosen Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) methods for secure vehicle interactions. Evolutionary computation has also created a two-layer taxonomy for intelligent check transportation in smart cities. Despite efforts to increase ITS security, benchmark research on continuing security requirements in real-world contexts still needs to be conducted. This article provides an intelligent route scheduling infrastructure for the smart city's innovative transportation system that uses ECC algorithms for safe vehicle interactions. The methodology that is being proposed has four main parts: intelligent metro transportation and intelligent route scheduling, intelligent car service and intelligent city communications architecture, intelligent infrastructure for electric vehicles and traffic lights, and EC for intelligent vehicle network and intelligent land transportation. Smart algorithms are used in intelligent metro transportation and route scheduling components to optimize the transportation system by determining the most effective routes for cars. This would make the transportation system more effective by reducing traffic and travel time. Modern communication technologies, intelligent car service, and smart city communications architecture enable cars to connect with the transportation network. By doing this, the transportation system would be able to acquire real-time data on vehicle movement and traffic flow, improving its ability to estimate travel times and congestion levels. Creating an infrastructure designed to assist electric cars is a part of the intelligent infrastructure for electric vehicles and traffic light components. This would include setting up charging stations and creating a smart grid system that would make it possible for cars to capture in a more effective and environmentally friendly way.

Sustainable transportation technologies,https://parsec-accelerator.eu/insight/sustainable-transportation-technologies/,N/A,"Autonomous driving, connected vehicles, electrification, ride-sharing, and mass-transit systems are set to change the face of mobility in cities 11. Zero-emission vehicles are attributed to the transportation options not resulting in harmful emissions during vehicle operation. Typical examples are electric (battery-powered) vehicles and trains, hydrogen-fuelled vehicles, and human/animal powered transportation. The battery technology for electric vehicles is based on charge/discharge cycles, that is, the battery is charged beforehand using an electricity source and is discharged when the vehicle is in operation. In the case of hydrogen-fueled vehicles, they are typically based on fuel cell technology. This implies the electrochemical conversion of fuel energy into electricity, with water and heat as the only emissions.

At a higher level, improving traffic control could contribute to the reduction of pressure on the infrastructure, improve the air quality, and make cities more liveable. To this aim, alternative models of transportation, active traffic management, and connected vehicles into an intelligent transportation system are being studied. The focus of smart transportation is to connect the different transportation modes into an integrated system in order to provide the citizens with valuable information to make the right choices of the form of travel. Smart transportation allows the control of the flow of traffic and provides added value with the best routes for emergency and law enforcement personnel. Cities rely on a massive system of IoT sensors, cameras, and mobile devices to gather data about incidents, traffic, and weather. A multitude of devices is connected to networks acquiring massive amounts of data that is managed through high-tech transactional services, unified communications, cloud, big data, and cybersecurity services.

Building smart transportation networks involves, as a first step, connecting the traffic light systems. Connecting all the data captured in one single data management service allows for flow optimization based on traffic routing. Then, the selected traffic user groups (buses, trucks, cars, etc.), are connected by installing onboard units. Also, device health management services are provided to monitor and manage smart devices and sensors. A managed multi-cloud service is used for data handling to ensure data accessibility.

Also, innovation in last-mile freight and parcel delivery solutions could yield significant benefits for cities by reducing traffic congestion in urban centres, improving public health by lessening greenhouse gas emissions (GHG). From the manufacturer’s plant or warehouse or a supplier or retailer location, the last mile of delivery is the final stage in the shipping process, culminating with the arrival of the package or good to the customer’s destination. Innovation in short distance deliveries represents a major opportunity for smart cities. According to a study of the Técnico Lisboa, any deliveries in urban areas are less than 5km and at least 25% could be accomplished via bicycle or non-motorized vehicles. Human-powered, robotic, and semi-autonomous vehicles should have an important role in the parcel delivery role.

Other improvements would be the design of advanced algorithms and analytics such as integrated inventory management, dynamic routing, courier collaboration, and proof-of-delivery tools. Looking to the future, drones and autonomous vehicles are expected to be integrated. Also, autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs) with parcel lockers would be introduced.

EO Relevance

EO is instrumental for efficient transportation. The canonical example today is Google Maps, and a plethora of similar apps, all of which improve and minimize travel time and distance. They are already self-adapting to live traffic data and weather conditions contributed on-the-fly by their users. The main problem is that in most cases the tools and data are proprietary (the exception being OpenStreetMaps). Converging to an open platform with free access would be extremely beneficial, with positive effects rippling through many industries other than transport.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of how the intelligent transportation system (ITS) supports freight transportation operations. A study of the literature on transportation information and communication technology (ICT) and intelligent (or smart) transportation systems has been conducted. Documents of more than 60 companies producing or using intelligent transportation technologies and systems have been reviewed to provide empirical data regarding freight ITSs. Furthermore, direct observations of some of the systems as well as semi-structured and nonstructured interviews with managers of some of the companies have been conducted as secondary sources of empirical data. As a result of studying the companies, a list of nine freight ITSs is generated; it represents the main freight ITSs. Also, different transportation information types that freight ITS work based on their availability are recognised. The results show that vehicle location systems and condition monitoring systems support and use more transportation information types compared to the other freight ITSs.

Keywords: freight transport; intelligent transport systems; ITS; smart transport management; performance dimensions; function; transport ICT; information and communications technology; information technology; vehicle location systems; condition monitoring.

Investigating the factors affecting smart transportation mobile ...,https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/28119,Автор: H Al-Bulushi,"Abstract:

The transportation condition in developing countries generally and in Oman particularly is characterized by inadequate public transportation, Inefficient transportation modes and Limited access to clean transportation. This condition has resulted in profound challenges in the transportation sector. One of the leading transportation problems that have existed for a long time is traffic congestion. This further caused an increment in the travelling costs, waiting time for passengers, and late arrivals for work, schools, and businesses. Also, most of the central areas in cities face a high demand for parking slots in which drivers spend a reasonable amount of time searching for parking space which can be compensated by money. Moreover, transportation decisions directly influence land use by reducing open areas such as parks and wildlife. The implementation of the new smart transportation technologies, including smart mobile applications, in addressing these urban transportation challenges through offering better traffic management, enabling automatic fee collections, ensuring safe driving, reducing trips via private cars, and providing cost-effective and simply accessible flexible transportation modes contributes to enhancing the cities’ ecological condition, presenting a healthier style of living. Smart transportation services and smart mobile applications implementation involves troves of smart technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and big data. Therefore, the public adoption and acceptance of smart services and smart mobile applications in smart transportation are vital to reduce congested traffic and improve quality of life. Yet, most of these services and applications are relatively new, with limited data exploring the extent of end user's acceptance of smart city services, especially in developing countries. Therefore, this thesis explored factors affecting citizens’ acceptance of smart transportation mobile applications in Oman to enhance the successful implementation of these smart applications. The majority of technology acceptance models have been developed and evaluated in developed countries. It would be imprudent to assume that these frameworks can be universally applicable among all nations, particularly in developing countries. Therefore, the latest UTAUT2 model was used to develop a model which was further extended and expanded in two ways to better address the developing nation context such as Oman. Firstly, an in-depth literature review on the smart city, smart transportation and technology acceptance studies revealed two new constructs: trust and satisfaction. Later, interviews with the smart transportation services providers also introduced two unique variables: awareness and former practice. A quantitative study was conducted on 383 Omani citizens for model validation. The finding indicates that only social influence, habit, and former practice directly influence Omani citizens’ behavioural intentions to adopt smart transportation mobile applications in the Omani context. The results represent a valuable contribution and a sign of progress for the literature on Information Technology acceptance, smart cities, and smart transportation. Also, provide recommendations for smart city services providers to improve the acceptance of smart transportation mobile applications.",smart transportation technologies
New Mobilities: Smart Planning for Emerging Transportation ...,https://vimeo.com/580860989,N/A,"New transportation technologies can expand our world by an order of magnitude, but the significant benefits they provide are often counterbalanced by the huge costs that they impose on individuals and communities. The rapid expansion of motorization over the last century created modes — and the urban infrastructure that accommodates them — that favor speed over affordability, efficiency and personal and community well-being. As new transportation innovations become more widely available, from e-scooters to autonomous cars, how do we learn from the past to make decisions that benefit ourselves and our communities? The new book, New Mobilities: Smart Planning for Emerging Transportation Technologies, critically evaluates 12 developing transportation modes and services that are likely to significantly affect our lives, and provides practical guidance for optimizing them. As we accelerate towards a new mobility revolution, come learn how to make informed decisions about advocating and planning for these innovative ways to move.

Pedestrian Behavior Study to Advance Pedestrian Safety in ...,https://nitc.trec.pdx.edu/research/project/1393/Pedestrian_Behavior_Study_to_Advance_Pedestrian_Safety_in_Smart_Transportation_Systems_Using_Innovative_LIDAR_Sensors,N/A,"Pedestrian safety is critical to improving walkability in cities. To that end, NITC researchers have developed a system for collecting pedestrian behavior data using LiDAR sensors. Tested at two intersections in Texas and soon to be tested at another in Salt Lake City, Utah, the new software created by a multi-university research team is able to reliably observe pedestrian behavior and can help reduce conflicts between pedestrians and vehicles at signalized intersections. The Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT) is working on implementing this new LiDAR system to improve data collection at intersections. The LiDAR system can especially improve multimodal travel at intersections with permissive left turns, which are indicated by a flashing yellow arrow. Previous research has shown that where a flashing yellow arrow, or FYA, is present, cars searching for a gap in traffic may not look for pedestrians. To remove the risk to people walking, some signals are programmed to turn off the FYA when a walk button is pushed. But what if the walk button is pushed and the pedestrian isn't really crossing there, or crosses very quickly and then leaves the crosswalk clear? Left-turning vehicles would still have to wait out the rest of the cycle. ""When crossing an intersection on a diagonal, we find that many people choose to press both walk buttons, and take whichever one changes first. So our solution will check a pedestrian's true intent to cross by tracking this pedestrian’s behavior during yellow, all-red and the first few seconds of green,"" said the project's principal investigator, Dr. Pengfei (Taylor) Li of the University of Texas at Arlington. If there is not a pedestrian present, then the FYA can resume so that left-turning vehicles are once again able to turn. It's a way of increasing efficiency and throughput while prioritizing safety. The research team, led by Li, included graduate students Peirong (Slade) Wang and Farzana Chowdhury of the University of Texas at Arlington; Dr. Sirisha Kothuri and graduate student Kathering Keeling of Portland State University; and Dr. Xianfeng (Terry) Yang of the University of Utah then (currently the University of Maryland). Wang, a PhD candidate, works as a graduate assistant in UTA's ACTION Lab; learn more about him in our March 2023 Student Spotlight. Chowdhury received her PhD from UTA in 2022 and now works as an associate consultant traffic engineer for WSP USA. Keeling received her master's in engineering from PSU in 2022 and is now an operations analyst at TriMet. TESTING THE SYSTEM The researchers deployed their LiDAR system at two intersections in Texas: Cooper Street at UTA Boulevard, a major intersection connecting two urban campuses of the University of Texas at Arlington with very high pedestrian volumes during semesters. West Walnut Hill Lane at North Belt Line Road in Irving, Texas, close to a high school. While field-testing the LiDAR devices, they conducted two separate studies. The first was a pedestrian behavior study, analyzing things like wait time before crossing, generalized perception-reaction time to the WALK sign, and walking speed. Results reveal that pedestrian behaviors do not always match with the recommendations found in pedestrian facility design guides such as AASHTO’s “Green Book."" The study also found that ADA-compliant (audible) pedestrian push buttons can significantly reduce the time it takes for pedestrians to move in response to a WALK signal. The second study was an exploration of how to separate permissive left-turning vehicles from concurrent crossing pedestrians, using the novel dynamic flashing yellow arrow (D-FYA) solution. The D-FYA solution was also evaluated in a simulation platform, with promising results. It will be evaluated soon at the test intersection in Salt Lake City. The findings of this study will advance the body of knowledge on equitable traffic safety, especially pedestrian safety. Kothuri, the PSU principal investigator who led the behavior analysis study, has conducted several research studies centered around multimodal data and pedestrian-focused signal timing. She helped to evaluate recorded pedestrian behaviors and to develop the custom software which captures performance measures such as pedestrian crossing time. Dr. Yang has also done extensive work in data-driven mobility strategies for multimodal transportation and connected vehicle systems. Mark Taylor, a traffic signal operations engineer for the Utah Department of Transportation (UDOT), is optimistic that the new sensor system can offer important functionality based on its improved bicycle and pedestrian detection. ""We have these goals and objectives to make our intersections and our roadways safe, and safer for all modes of travel. Not just vehicles, and not just buses and trucks, but the vulnerable road users as well; bikes as well as pedestrians, and with zero fatalities. The big thing about LiDAR is you're able to get a 3D image of everything around you and what is happening in real time. With this system, you're able to look at things like red light running and near misses for pedestrians and vehicles, and you're able to see a lot more information that the traditional detector is not able to provide you with,"" Taylor said. The improved LiDAR sensors could enable UDOT to tailor traffic signals to travelers' needs, potentially adjusting signal timing in real time. The system could also integrate with vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2X) connected vehicle technology. ""We're looking at walking speeds, which means that we are able to provide additional crossing time for slower pedestrians if needed,"" Taylor said. ""We are also looking at the feasibility of taking the location of the pedestrian and broadcasting that location to connected vehicle technology. Just being able to communicate to vehicles that, hey! There is a pedestrian on the corner of the intersection."" Based on this NITC project, UDOT funded another project, ""Utilizing LIDAR sensors to detect pedestrian movements at signalized intersections,"" to deploy the pedestrian tracking system at a test intersection in Salt Lake City. This project is one of three parallel LiDAR-based projects that UDOT is working on, in order to better understand LiDAR sensors' potential to improve traffic operations. This research was funded by the National Institute for Transportation and Communities, with additional support from the City of Arlington, Texas; the Oregon Department of Transportation, the University of Texas at Arlington and the University of Utah.",smart transportation technologies

It leads to a high number of accidents, money & time lost in commuting, and overall loss of economic growth & productivity. However, through remote sensors, autonomous vehicles, 5G networks, vehicle-sharing services, dynamic traffic signals, and better infrastructure, automotive safety, and efficiency can be increased. Hence, these factors are driving the demand for smart transportation networks.

Ongoing Technological Advancements to Augment Growth

Internet of Things (IoT) based devices gather and transmit real-time data to people about traffic, weather, and incidents, among other activities, to plan their journeys more effectively. Increasing adoption by transit agencies in applications such as train control systems, toll collection systems, fleet telematics, and transport logistics has improved system capacity while minimizing operating costs.

Furthermore, the need to manage the increasing amount of data generated through the vast number of IoT devices used in the transport infrastructure is also creating significant new revenue streams for service providers and independent software vendors, among other solution providers. Hence, technological advancements in the current transportation infrastructure will drive the smart transportation market growth.

Restraining Factors:

Lack of Standardized Technology to Restrain Growth

Smart transportation combines various elements such as hardware, software, and mobile network components developed by multiple vendors, leading to compatibility issues due to the absence of a standardized approach. Furthermore, communication protocols also differ substantially across different countries, creating problems for manufacturers regarding the global adoption of their technologies.

Growth Opportunity:

Autonomous vehicles to provide growth opportunities for smart transportation solution providers

Semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles are witnessing a rapid evolution with substantial technological advancements. Automatic vehicles drive themselves with minimal or no human intervention. The trend of developing driverless vehicles can be observed throughout the transportation industry. Though the large-scale adoption of autonomous vehicles would take significant time, several transportation operators are expected to introduce semi-autonomous vehicles in the future.

Semi-autonomous vehicle technology is currently deployed in cars by some companies, which provide mobility-on-demand services. The deployment of autonomous vehicles is crucial for the growth of the smart transportation industry, as these vehicles do not require drivers and would result in cost reduction for mobility service providers. Autonomous vehicles are still being developed; some players in the smart transportation market are already working in this direction.

Trending Factors:

Increasing Focus on Interoperability of Systems is a Prominent Smart Transportation Market Trend

A key area of focus for key players in the market including mobile network operators and automakers is increasing the coordination of communication protocols that different organizations have developed independently.

For instance, the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management developed the Transport Operator to Mobility as a Service (MaaS) Provider – Application Programming Interface (TOMP API). It is a standardized interface that allows communication regarding booking, support, and end-user-specific multimodal trip payments. Such a system enhances interoperability between participating companies in the intelligent transportation ecosystem. Hence, these factors will positively influence the growth of the market.

Europe held the largest share of the market and stood at US$ 38.99 billion in 2022. It can be attributed to the substantial funding for infrastructure through grant programs such as the Connecting Europe Facility (CEF), which has facilitated more than 763 projects with up to US$ 22 billion in funding. For instance, in March 2021, the European Council and the European Parliament reached an agreement to renew the CEF with a budget of 25.8 billion euros to fund transport projects between 2021 & 2027. Hence, these factors will fuel the growth of the market in this region.

Asia Pacific is anticipated to exhibit a higher CAGR during the forecast period. This can be attributed to the supportive regulatory measures that have facilitated the rapid advancement of smart transportation infrastructure in countries such as China and South Korea. For instance, in 2018, in China, the Ministry of Transport issued a Notice on Accelerating the New Generation of National Traffic Control Networks and Smart Highway Pilots. It focuses on infrastructure digitization, new national traffic control networks, and integrated management of road networks based on big data, among other areas.

Hence, several provinces implemented pilot projects that included Guangdong, Hebei, and Beijing, among others. Furthermore, to provide substantial support for smart transport applications, the National Intelligent Transportation System Standardization Technical Committee has issued more than 90 communication standards. Hence, these factors are driving the growth of the market in this region.

North America is also expected to show good growth in the market. In the US, cooperation between federal and state authorities has increased over policy guidance and financing, hence accelerating road testing and software development. For instance, in 2018, Pittsburgh piloted intelligent traffic signals in 50 intersections across the city. Idling time declined by more than 40%, and travel time was reduced by around 25%. Hence, infrastructure expansion, particularly in the U.S., will drive the growth of the market in this region.

Historic US government infrastructure investment needs ...,https://www.thesmartcityjournal.com/en/articles/historic-us-government-infrastructure-investment-needs-smart-transportation-focus,N/A,"At Global Traffic Technologies we see first-hand how infrastructure investments can be an invaluable tool for improving safety and increasing prosperity

In the US, the Biden Administration and Congress are currently considering historic investments in the nation’s infrastructure through the American Jobs Plan (AJP) and other proposals. This is an opportunity to deliver more than just investments in 20th-century physical infrastructure; it is a chance to provide the backend technology that will bring that infrastructure into the latter half of the 21st century, enabling the smart cities of the future.

At Global Traffic Technologies (GTT), we see first-hand how infrastructure investments can be an invaluable tool for improving safety and increasing prosperity, and we believe there are a host of Internet of Things (IoT)-based, technology-centred initiatives that can improve traffic safety and protect the environment for all, in both the short and long-term. Technology-based infrastructure investment can also play a vital role in driving greater social equity.

The following are six smart city-focused transportation, transit, and public safety technology initiatives we believe that any new government investment should incorporate.

Prioritize Smart Intersection Connectivity

To begin building the smart infrastructure needed to drive American cities into the future, we need to ensure our intersections are connected – either with fiber optic or cellular communications – and we should aim to achieve a 50 percent increase in connectivity of existing intersections by 2030. Smart intersections hold the potential for safer and more efficient, sustainable, accessible, and flexible traffic management.

Advance Vision Zero

We support President Biden’s proposed “Safe Streets for All” program to fund state and local Vision Zero plans. The 40,000 lives lost in the United States each year to traffic accidents is far too many. These tragic deaths take an enormous personal toll on families and communities and cost society at large in the form of taxpayer spending on emergency response and health care costs. Since traffic deaths are a pervasive and systemic issue, we embrace the Vision Zero approach of shifting the responsibility for road safety from individual users to a model of shared responsibility between traffic system designers and road users.

Promote Accessibility and Equity in Public Transit

Access to safe, reliable, and convenient transportation options has the power to transform the lives of users and the community at large. An increase in public transit ridership of 50 percent and the provision of greater accessibility for disadvantaged communities will expand and drive the benefits of public transit, including reduced congestion, decreased air and climate pollution, and enhanced social and economic opportunity. Mobility is deeply tied to social exclusion, as existing limitations on public transit service areas and transit accessibility can prevent marginalized groups from participating in the economic, political, and social aspects of their communities.

Research has shown that low‐income and economically disadvantaged populations tend to have significantly longer, more complex, and more unreliable commutes; smart, inclusive mobility is critical for cities of the future.

Protect Public Health by Reducing Harmful Emission

Governments should commit to reducing emissions of harmful conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases associated with the transportation sector by 75 percent by 2040. Reducing emissions from city traffic is an essential component of addressing climate change. A key strategy is using traffic signal priority control systems within smart cities. Such systems help to achieve emissions reduction goals by reducing the length of time public transit vehicles are idling; spur greater public transit ridership through improved system reliability and efficiency, and enhance individual vehicle efficiency by reducing start/stop driving.

Scale Infrastructure With The Power of Software

Financing our physical infrastructure with capital investment-intensive models worked for the 20th century, but those models now need to evolve to modernize infrastructure for the future. Cities should allow for more flexible, subscription-based purchase models that recognize the core role of innovative and IoT-based transportation and transit technology as infrastructure upgrades, not just services.

Incorporate Connectivity With Intersections Into All New Vehicles

Connectivity will power the smart cities of the future. We encourage vehicle manufacturers to equip all new vehicles with connectivity to the cloud or directly to intersections by 2035. By enabling all vehicles to interact with transportation infrastructure, cities can promote safety, reduce congestion and maximize traffic efficiency, thereby lowering emissions of harmful pollutants from vehicle transportation.

Collectively, these actions aim to create the most good for the most people. If implemented, they will help save lives, improve access to public transit mobility for the vulnerable and disadvantaged, improve the environment through lower emissions and reduced congestion, and expand the number of communities that will benefit from smart transportation technologies.

Smart Transportation for All? A Typology of Recent U.S. Smart ...,https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781000404371/chapters/10.4324/9781003145868-22,N/A,"Greater integration of advanced vehicle technologies is commonly discussed as a component of developing smart cities, potentially leading to a host of benefits. Final impacts of such benefits are uncertain, though, given research that illustrates induced travel by initial adopters of emerging vehicle technologies and services and mixed effects in transit use and active transportation. The locations within cities where interventions of advanced vehicle technologies are envisioned, geographic scope and extent of integration, and the characteristics of these areas are all likely to influence these effects, and these relationships have received limited investigative attention. To address this, we conducted a comprehensive review of proposals submitted by 78 midsized cities in the United States to create a typology that considers (1) the geographic scope of intervention and (2) the degree of integration of connected and automated vehicles, generating five distinct types of projects. Characteristics of the areas within cities identified for intervention are compared to those of their U.S. Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). We identified indicators of comprehensive planning efforts as they relate to sustainability and resilience outcomes in each city. Results show that areas identified by cities for advanced vehicle technology interventions differ in important ways from each city’s broader population that warrant attention relative to known demographic characteristics and behavior of early adopters of transportation technologies. There is also variation in project motivation and municipal planning indicators across typology classifications. These are essential considerations as smart city-aligned transportation interventions continue to develop.",smart transportation technologies

Smart Transportation Gets the Green Light,https://social-innovation.hitachi/en-us/think-ahead/transportation/smart-transportation-gets-the-green-light/,N/A,"How a Mobility Ecosystem Will Make Getting Around Town Safer and Easier

Mass adoption of fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) may be years away, but smart transportation is already here in locales ranging from large, urban cities to smaller, progressive towns. These communities are harnessing technology and business innovations to make transportation safer, more sustainable and more enjoyable. They’re adopting connected cars with advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS); electric vehicles including bicycles, scooters, buses and cars; and mobility-as-a-service (MaaS) business models such as ride and car sharing and e-hailing to help residents navigate for both work and play. That’s good news, because conventional transportation, with its focus on gas-guzzling vehicles, contributes to social and environmental ills. In the United States, these issues include:

Traffic accidents — 94% of automobile accidents are caused by human error. 1

Pollution — 28% of annual greenhouse gas emissions are from transportation. 2

Wasted fuel — 3.3 billion gallons of gasoline are squandered annually due to congestion. 3

Wasted time — Americans spend an average of 54 hours a year being stuck in traffic. 4

Wasted money — Consumers lose $1,010 a year per person in wasted productivity and fuel costs.5

Although COVID-19 has granted a temporary reprieve as millions of American workers telecommute, eventually many workers will return to the office, filling the highways and streets with traffic and bringing these issues back to the fore. Some communities are ahead of the curve and implementing transportation systems to address these problems and improve the lives of commuters within their jurisdictions.

Using mobility as a service to enhance community amenities

To develop these ambitious multimodal transportation systems, transportation organizations and other mobility providers are working with Hitachi to take advantage of its advanced movement analytics capabilities. These capabilities provide real-time information across the mobility spectrum, integrating drones, connected buses, connected cars, autonomous driverless shuttles, passenger movements, bicycles and other data sources.



By co-creating their systems with Hitachi, these providers can help riders move through their multimodal journey, while providing tracking capabilities and command directions to connected mobility devices. For example, a rider might choose to bicycle to the town center, consult a trip-planning kiosk and then catch an AV to another destination. Although the rider is unaware of the infrastructure supporting this journey, Hitachi’s advanced movement analytics is behind it. By pushing intelligence to the edge, Hitachi provides partners and other mobility providers with contextual data that vehicles can use to make their own decisions in concert with other smart assets.

For example, in Lake Nona, Florida, smart transportation is accelerating, thanks to a partnership between this 17-square-mile, privately owned community and several innovative organizations. The town has enlisted Hitachi, Beep and Local Motors to join its developer, Tavistock Development Company, to achieve a vision of integrated mobility that will be a powerful brand attractor for this “community of and for the future.”6 The project will include a full-service mobility hub, which connects multiple modes of transportation to the Lake Nona Town Center; a multiacre park with dedicated routes for pedestrians, bicycles, scooters and AVs; a bridge connecting the park with the hub; more than 25 miles of dedicated AV lanes; and bicycle trails.7 And in East Baton Rouge Parish in Louisiana, Hitachi has partnered with Capital Area Transit System (CATS) to enhance the experience of its transit system riders. By working closely together, Hitachi and CATS will digitalize the flow of information to passengers to make it easy for riders to buy tickets, and to know where their bus is and when it will arrive. Based on Lumada, Hitachi’s IoT platform, the service will provide a multichannel messaging and mobile wallet experience to bring an improved passenger experience to underserved. The multiyear agreement will enable CATS and Hitachi to gather data insights about the holistic passenger journey that can drive operational improvements and enhanced service offerings for CATS passengers.

Delivering a safer, smarter transportation experience

A move into smart transportation is good business. Consumers want a better transportation experience that frees them from the grind of commuting and the high costs of owning and operating conventional vehicles. With MaaS models, consumers get a better commuting or riding experience that will be continually enhanced with new innovations. For example, vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications enables cars to communicate with other vehicles and infrastructure around them, such as stoplights and tollbooths, via short-range wireless connections. Is that car veering into your lane? V2X will enable your vehicle to make an instant course correction to avoid a collision. For urban and underserved consumers, MaaS models will simplify payment for public transit services and enable them to move seamlessly across city landscapes, such as from bus to subway and back again. Meanwhile, the global rollout of 5G will enable developers to focus on evolving autonomous car capabilities, including the in-car experience, offering features such as infotainment and pervasive wireless connectivity. Instead of driving to work, losing time as you navigate stop-and-go traffic, imagine being able to hail an autonomous vehicle that navigates the best course to your destination, while you safely hold a video meeting or work on a presentation. As vehicle electrification continues to evolve, with smaller and more powerful batteries and a network of charging stations, the country will move ever closer to achieving the dream of zero-emissions transportation, providing cleaner air for all to breathe.

Providing custom solutions for communities aligns with Hitachi’s vision to power good. Hitachi is working closely with private enterprise and government customers to harness innovative technology to accomplish such goals as transforming transportation and designing smart cities. The new business builds on Hitachi’s Lumada data management and automation platform to help achieve a zero-carbon society with various measures including the use of renewable energies. In addition, Hitachi offers powerful data analytics capabilities that smart city and MaaS providers and others will be able to tap to develop new public infrastructure solutions and offer compelling new consumer services.



Will smart transportation help galvanize the development of smart cities, where interconnected services, personalization, and consumer-friendly interfaces make it safer and easier to work, live, move and play? We’re counting on it.

In fact, it can also overcome congestion to pollution.

This was conveyed by Budi in the Smart Transportation Forum or Intelligent Transport System (ITS) Asia Pacific 2024 at the Jakarta Convention Center (JCC), Tuesday, May 28.

Budi said, this forum has an important role to play in overcoming various challenges, such as rapid urbanization, climate change, and technological advances. Given, the world's population is growing very rapidly, in 2050 it is estimated that two-thirds of the world's population will live in urban areas.

This will present various challenges for the transportation sector, such as congestion, accidents, hampered goods transport services, to carbon gas pollution. Therefore, in my opinion, the smart transportation system is able to overcome these problems by utilizing technology,"" he said.

Budi also said that today there had been a discussion on the high level round table which was attended by a number of parties, such as transportation ministers from several countries, ambassadors from a number of countries, government representatives, international organizations, and the private sector.

Furthermore, Budi said the discussion had produced several important ideas that should be of concern and joint action, including the need to encourage regional connectivity in the digital-based transportation era, encourage the development of inclusive land transportation facilities and infrastructure, as well as the integration of various modes of transportation.

Therefore, Budi welcomes new solutions and initiatives at the global, regional and national levels in order to accelerate joint progress towards the 2030 Sustainable Development Target.

""To achieve that common goal, we must prioritize partnerships and commitments to improve and accelerate the implementation of smart transportation systems and explore creative financing mechanisms and strategies that involve many stakeholders,"" he explained.

Then, the Minister of Transportation also emphasized the importance of improving the regulatory framework and increasing the capacity of Human Resources (HR) in order to achieve smart and sustainable urban transportation. Other points that are no less important, continued Budi, all stakeholders need to continue to share knowledge and experience so that this shared vision can be realized.

Budi also appreciated the Jakarta Initiative on Sustainable and Intelligent Urban Mobility initiated by ITS Indonesia. This initiative is a form of ITS support in realizing urban mobility that is beneficial for the economy, useful for the community, and environmentally friendly.

To realize sustainable smart transportation, Budi said that the involvement of all parties in the transportation sector is needed.

He also encouraged the creation of useful discussions, valuable partnerships, and follow-up plans, which will ultimately transform the world's transportation system, especially in the Asia Pacific region.

""Hopefully this forum can inspire us to encourage the vision of sustainable smart transportation throughout Asia Pacific and its surroundings,"" concluded Budi.

Meanwhile, Indonesian Vice President Ma'ruf Amin said the smart transportation system is expected not only to be the answer to the increasing mobility of urban communities, but is also able to reduce congestion, greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, as well as improve safety.

Ma'ruf appreciated this forum. The reason is, it has united the government, the private sector, and academics to share knowledge, experience, and innovation related to technology as well as smart transportation systems.

The intelligent transportation system has been the focus of developing global transportation technology in recent years. All countries are working to continue to develop a more efficient, effective, user-friendly, and sustainable transportation system, ""explained Ma'ruf.

Smart Transportation in Small- and Medium-sized Cities ...,https://transweb.sjsu.edu/research/2221-Small-Cities-Rural-Community-Transportation-Inequality,N/A,"The research on smart transportation in the United States has centered on large metropolitan areas. The adoption of smart transportation technologies in small- and medium-sized cities outside of large metropolitan areas is less studied and understood. This study examined the adoption of smart transportation technologies in small- and medium-sized cities in Central California. The analysis was based on the online survey responses from 29 transportation officials and professionals who worked for 18 municipal government departments and six metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) in Central California as well as in-depth semi-structured interviews with seven of them. The study showed that smart transportation in small- and medium-sized cities was mainly car-centric. Slightly more than half of the survey respondents were either unsure or suspicious about the usefulness of smart transportation technologies in addressing local transportation problems. The study revealed several barriers to the adoption of smart transportation technologies in small- and medium-sized cities including insufficient funding, limited staff capacity, a lack of coordination among small cities within a region, small population sizes, and low-density of development. The interviews suggested that some of these barriers, particularly the funding issue, were more complicated than they first appeared.

Smart City Transportation Examples Urban Planners Must ...,https://www.acbconsultingservices.com/construction-management-for-transportation/smart-city-transportation-examples-urban-planners-must-apply/,N/A,"Smart Cities Are Changing the World

Smart cities are changing the world. Smart transportation solutions are becoming more efficient, sustainable, and safer. They have brought about a new way of living and doing business. A few examples of the benefits of smart cities include:

Reducing traffic congestion: Smart cities use geographical information to create roads that are efficient and reduce traffic congestion

Reducing pollution: Due to smart city initiatives, the air quality has been improving continuously

Reducing the cost to operate: Smart cities use sensors to control air-conditioning systems, parking meters, and streetlights

Improving safety for all: With the use of smart cameras, police officers can answer calls faster to ensure safety

To deliver these benefits, forward-thinking is needed in how we plan, design, and develop our cities. In this article, we take a brief look at three key questions, using examples to demonstrate:

What tools should urban planners embed into the fabric of a smart city? How are private and public organizations responding? What is the key to success in smart transportation solutions?

5 Tools of Smart Transportation

There are many tools in smart transportation that are being used to improve urban mobility and make it easier for people to travel.

These tools include apps for public transport, personal mobility devices, shared bikes, autonomous cars, and electric vehicles. Each has the potential to deliver faster transit times, reduced pollution levels, cleaner air quality, improved safety measures, and access to information about transit routes. Five examples are:

Adaptive traffic signaling

Adaptive traffic signals work to reduce congestion and help traffic flow more efficiently by regulating when traffic signals change. Instead of old-fashioned timed signals, by using sensors signals can respond to changes in traffic flow fluidly and in real-time.

The data collected by these sensors can also be used to send signals to traffic, either through smart-connected onboard computers or to direction signaling, to direct vehicles away from congested routes.

Smart public transport solutions

The introduction of AI-driven smart public transport solutions helps passengers in managing their transit time and safety. This includes providing real-time information on bus timings, service disruptions, and estimated arrival times at different stations.

Bike and pedestrian solutions

Bike paths are an important part of any smart transport solution. On-road bike paths are created by taking away pavement from the roadway so that it can be replaced with smooth material such as concrete, asphalt, or cobblestone to create safer cycling in cities.

By using AI solutions to connect cycle paths and sidewalks to other transit solutions, we can increase safety for cyclists and pedestrians. This will encourage more people to walk or cycle, thus reducing congestion and pollution further.

Smart parking solutions

Increasingly, city transport authorities are using sensors to measure traffic and public transport, which then provides data on when and where it is most convenient to park your vehicle. This reduces the time it takes to park, easing congestion, and reducing the fuel used to find a parking space.

Vehicle to Infrastructure Technology

V2I technology is a vehicle-to-infrastructure communication system that enables vehicles to exchange information, respond to each other, and better coordinate their travel. Information that is sent includes road safety information, road congestion data, and weather alerts.

5 Incredible Smart City Transportation Projects

Private and public companies and transportation bodies are ramping up their response to smart city policymaking. Indeed, for cities to become truly smart, it is our belief that urban planners must collaborate more closely with external companies to drive the innovative solutions required.

Examples of what can be achieved and how innovative solutions are being developed include autonomous cars, spatial mobility, and intelligent public transport in smart cities. Helping to deliver these, we see solutions such as:

The smart city bus, made with technology that can be remotely operated by drivers using their phone or tablet devices and GPS. The device is designed to reduce traffic accidents by detecting traffic signals, pedestrians, and cyclists, and using digital maps for navigation. Digital highways, using digital maps to provide real-time information about traffic conditions to drivers to save time, fuel, and money. Autonomous taxi cabs, utilizing artificial intelligence, allow passengers to travel from point A to B as smoothly and efficiently as possible. VW has introduced the Volkswagen ID Buzz, the world’s first autonomous electric car for public transit use, and Ford plans to have its first autonomous cars with Lyft by the end of this year. Shared mobility solutions, with reserved parking spaces for car-sharing cars. These should be close to public transport and incorporate charging points for electric vehicles. Connected vehicle solutions that include adaptive cruise control, automated route planning, and automated vehicle braking.

5 key ways for urban planners to make smart transportation a success

By implementing smart transportation solutions, urban planners have the potential to make a real difference in the world. To be successful, urban planners must:

Continually update the city’s growth plans with sustainable, smart design

Invest into and install intelligent transportation solutions

Discuss and share the importance of collaboration with communities and external stakeholders and innovative companies

Make the plan easy to access

Ensure they are planning not only for today’s technology but also for probable technology advances, too

5 Reasons we must strive to plan better for smart transportation

Urban planners have a level of responsibility that goes beyond simply building new homes. They need to consider everything from the urban infrastructure and the safety of people to the sustainability of their city’s transportation options. Here are five reasons urban planners must strive to plan better for smart transportation:

Smart transportation is managed more effectively

The amount of data collected by smart transportation systems is huge, and with AI systems able to analyze this data in moments, and then use machine learning to continually improve, management of transportation is far more effective.

Smart transportation is managed more efficiently

As management of transport is more effective, it also becomes more efficient, with improvements made continuously, including in how public transport in smart cities is managed.

Smart transportation reduces costs

Costs are reduced across the whole transport infrastructure ─ from the number of employees to the amount of energy and gas consumed.

Smart transportation is safer

AI-driven transport systems don’t suffer from human fatigue. They don’t get emotional or become distracted. The result? Fewer accidents and faster, more efficient journeys.

Smart transportation makes cities more sustainable

Reduction in energy usage costs to manage, and the number of accidents improve the lives of a city’s population. Combined with lower energy use and lower pollution, our urban centers will become more sustainable.

Keys to Effective Collaboration with 3PL Providers,https://gcelogistic.com/keys-effective-collaboration-3pl-providers/,N/A,"It’s no secret that rising transportation costs are one of the greatest supply chain risks faced by exporting firms. A 2016, Third-Party Logistics Study found that 70% of all shippers attribute successful collaboration with their 3PL providers as a main driver in logistics cost reductions, with a further 75% saying that 3PLs help businesses innovate and find effective ways of improving existing logistics.

It’s clear that nowadays 3PL providers are providing more than just cost-savings; increasingly partnerships with 3PLs are becoming long-term investments that benefit both parties. Now businesses invest in technologies, integrate business processes, share vital shipment information and divide responsibilities as well as supply chain accountability with their 3PL partners. In this environment it is necessary that both organizations share common objectives and that planning, management and execution are all coordinated to reflect these interests.

Here are some key elements of successful 3PL collaborations.

Research before Making a Selection

Many businesses make the mistake of rushing the decision to choose their 3PL provider without considering their objectives. This means the 3PL partner you select might not have the capacity or reach to ship to your target destinations, or they may have different expectations regarding contract pricing.

Make sure that your 3PL provides a stable unified platform with consistent processes across the enterprise. Many of these firms are the result of several acquisitions and mergers with a resultant variability in services. Amongst other details you should assess before making your choice are the 3PL’s level of service, technological capabilities, management, proven reputation, strategic direction, expected results and corporate culture.

An Integrated Logistics Relationship

It is important to establish the relationship with your 3PL provider in quantifiable terms, without restricting innovation and decision-making for either party. Agreeing to a Service Level Agreement (SLA) with commonly agreed KPIs will help you track the effectiveness of your partnership through real metrics. It’s important that common processes and objectives such as customer service, IT, cost reductions, logistical improvement and high standards are also codified in this agreement to provide a framework for shared functions.

It is important that this agreement is reviewed periodically. If changes are necessary due to changes in the industry or your relationship, then these can be commonly agreed upon as well.

Regular Communication

Great partnerships are cemented through consistent and effective communication, as well as the sharing of vital information. This includes internal and external sharing between partners as well the measurement of results and their communication. Good communication will help you resolve conflicts before they occur, and when they do, it will help you resolve the issues at hand and make decisions towards changing processes, so that those scenarios don’t occur again.

Sharing Risks and Rewards

This is a business partnership, so your 3PL should function as an extension of your own business. It may be necessary to share joint premises with your 3PL in order to foster better communication and to aid joint planning. Gain-sharing agreements are another way to show your business’s commitment to partnership by sharing risks and rewards in a 50-50 split.",3PL startup strategic investment
Streamlined 3PL Drop Shipping & Manufacturers,https://deco-plate.com/3pl-drop-shipping/,N/A,"Introduction: 3PL Drop Shipping

In e-commerce, third-party logistics (3PL) and print-on-demand (POD) services have emerged as pivotal elements in the supply chain. This blog post delves into the essence of 3PL drop shipping, its harmonization with print on demand services for handmade and personalized items such as dinnerware and hospitalityware.

There are undeniable advantages of opting for high-quality materials from reputable domestic providers known for their quick lead times and minimized administrative efforts.

Understanding the Need for 3PL Drop Shipping Manufacturers

3PL drop shipping is a supply chain management model where e-commerce businesses outsource their inventory management, packaging, and shipping processes to third-party logistics providers. These providers store products in their warehouses and fulfill orders on behalf of the e-commerce entity, directly shipping them to the customer. This model significantly reduces the need for businesses to maintain physical inventory spaces or handle logistics, allowing them to focus more on product development, marketing, and customer service.

Benefits of 3PL Drop Shipping

Reduced Overhead Costs: Businesses save on the expenses associated with warehousing, staffing, and shipping logistics.

Scalability: 3PL services can easily adjust to fluctuating demand, making it easier for businesses to scale without major upfront investments in logistics infrastructure.

Focus on Core Competencies: Companies can concentrate on product development and market expansion, leaving the complexities of order fulfillment to experts.

3PL Drop Ship Manufacturers: Synergy with Services

Print on Demand (POD) is a manufacturing process where items are printed or manufactured only after an order is received, eliminating the need for inventory. When combined with 3PL drop shipping, POD services offer a seamless, efficient, and cost-effective method for businesses to provide a wide range of customized products to their customers without significant upfront costs.

Integrating POD with 3PL: Drop Ship Manufacturers

Customization and Personalization: POD allows for the creation of custom, made-to-order products, which 3PL providers can then store briefly (if at all) and ship directly to customers.

Efficiency and Speed: This combination leverages the strengths of both services to ensure that products are manufactured quickly and shipped efficiently, enhancing customer satisfaction.

Reduced Waste: By producing items only as they are ordered, businesses significantly reduce the risk of overproduction and unsold inventory, aligning with sustainable business practices.

The Importance of Quality Materials and Trusted Domestic Providers

Choosing high-quality materials and working with trusted domestic providers for manufacturing are critical decisions that significantly impact product quality, customer satisfaction, and overall brand reputation. Here are the advantages of making such choices:

Advantages of Quality Materials

Durability and Reliability: Products manufactured from superior materials last longer and perform better, ensuring customer satisfaction and repeat business.

Brand Image: High-quality products enhance the brand’s reputation, setting it apart from competitors and justifying premium pricing.

Benefits of Trusted Domestic Providers

Reduced Administrative Time: Working with domestic providers simplifies the ordering process, customs, and shipping logistics, saving valuable administrative time and effort.

Support Local Economies: Choosing domestic drop ship manufacturers and services providers supports local industries and economies, an aspect increasingly valued by consumers and businesses alike.

Drop Shipping Dinnerware and Hospitalityware

In the niche market of handmade personalized dinnerware and hospitalityware, the integration of third-party logistics (3PL) services with print-on-demand (POD) manufacturing stands as a cornerstone for businesses aiming to streamline operations while maintaining the uniqueness and quality of their offerings. This fusion not only facilitates operational efficiency but also significantly enhances customer satisfaction and market reach. Let’s delve into why 3PL is indispensable in this specific segment.

Customization Meets Efficiency

The essence of offering personalized dinnerware and hospitalityware lies in the ability of drop ship manufacturers to provide customers with products that are tailor-made to their specifications, often incorporating custom designs, monograms, or messages. This level of customization, while highly appealing, demands a manufacturing and supply chain model that is both flexible and responsive. Enter the need for drop ship manufacturers, and enabling agility.

First, 3PL services bring operational agility to the table, literally and figuratively. By managing inventory, warehousing, and shipping, they allow businesses to focus on their core competency: creating high-quality, customized products. This is particularly crucial for items like dinnerware and hospitalityware, where the production process can be intricate and time-consuming. 3PL providers can adjust resources dynamically to match demand fluctuations, ensuring that businesses can scale up or down without the burden of fixed logistics costs.

In the business of personalized products, speed to market is also key. Customers expect not only customization but also prompt delivery. 3PL providers excel in optimizing logistics, from warehousing closer to customer bases to selecting the most efficient shipping routes and methods. This logistical prowess translates to faster delivery times, enhancing customer satisfaction and boosting repeat business.

Quality Control and Brand Reputation

For businesses specializing in handmade items, quality is paramount. A damaged piece or a delayed order can tarnish a brand’s reputation. 3PL providers are well-versed in handling fragile items, ensuring that they are stored, packed, and shipped with the utmost care. Furthermore, by leveraging advanced tracking and management systems, 3PL services provide transparency throughout the supply chain, allowing businesses to monitor order fulfillment in real-time and swiftly address any issues that arise. Better quality assurance and control.

Global Reach, Local Touch

Expanding into new markets is a goal for many businesses in the personalized dinnerware and hospitalityware sector. 3PL services play a pivotal role in turning this goal into reality by offering an international logistics network that can seem daunting for a business to develop independently. With 3PL, businesses can offer their unique, personalized products to a global audience without compromising the local touch that makes their offerings special. This global reach is facilitated through international warehousing and fulfillment solutions, making worldwide expansion not just possible but also manageable.

How 3PLs can deliver strategic value in an omni-channel ...,https://supplychaindigital.com/logistics/how-3pls-can-deliver-strategic-value-omni-channel-world,N/A,"The demands of the omni-channel customer are forcing retailers and manufacturers to quickly adapt to become more agile and responsive. This challenge presents an opportunity to third-party logistics providers (3PLs), as they are ideally positioned to help retailers and manufacturers transform their supply chain operations.



However, as the demise of City Link in the UK highlighted, this new environment also presents a threat to those 3PLs who fail to move with the times.

In data we trust

A recent study by Capgemini revealed 72 per cent of businesses plan to increase their use of outsourced logistics services in future. Additionally, it highlighted that 98 per cent of 3PL customers believe the continued success of their global supply chains depends on managing data and being able to make more informed decisions. Despite this, only 55 per cent thought their 3PL provider had the technology capabilities to meet their aims; the opportunity and solution for 3PLs lies in being able to provide this data.

However, the question remains: why aren’t 3PLs investing in IT? Firstly, the uncertainty and volatility in customer relationships has traditionally made long-term investment in new technology risky. Secondly, many 3PLs lack the in-house expertise to understand, evaluate and implement new, advanced systems. Thirdly, some 3PLs have insufficient or outdated technology stacks that cannot support the advanced systems required.

The overarching reason, however, is that most logistics partnerships are focused on short-term, tactical objectives, such as cost reduction and improved service levels, not on long-term strategic advantages. Yet, advances in technology, vendor services and cloud platforms can overcome all of these challenges, and allow 3PLs to really position themselves as strategic partners.

The pool of strategic data

3PLs already possess a wealth of global and local market data on their customer’s customers. They know who is ordering what products; how product demand varies from month-to-month; how customers like to receive their shipments, and more. But this data is only being applied now at a basic level. With a better approach towards embracing technology, it could be used to deliver real strategic insights to help manufacturers and retailers manage volatility effectively.

Just imagine if a 3PL business could provide these consumer insights in real-time, directly to their customers’ demand planning and sales forecasting departments. Or if they were able to inform them on how to create the best product bundles, value-added services or delivery options based on actual consumer needs. Having access to this knowledge would enable manufacturers and retailers to more intelligently and profitably fulfil orders, and deliver a seamless omni-channel shopping experience. Furthermore, the 3PL providing this knowledge will immediately stand out as a strategic partner.

From a 3PL’s perspective, using technology to provide differentiated services can support a business’s growth strategy in a number of ways. 3PLs operate in a narrow margin environment and have primarily relied on organic growth; consequently, this has meant they have had to maintain lean practices in order to keep afloat. But doing so today has become increasingly difficult since the market has matured and grown more saturated.

Offering an array of advanced services would allow 3PLs to return to the days of organic growth and widen operating margins as they attract more customers and their spending. Further margin increases can be achieved from the efficiency benefits achieved from utilising technology, enabling 3PLs to become leaner. Additionally, for smaller 3PLs, these benefits could even make them attractive bidding targets in the eyes of larger businesses – such is the case with US logistics business, XPO and its plans to buy France-based logistics firm, Norbert Dentressangle.

The time is now

This vision might seem futuristic or unrealistic to many 3PLs who are burdened with outdated technologies and business-critical relationships. But a leading few are already moving in this direction. They, along with their manufacturing and retail customers, have come to understand that business competition is increasingly being won through supply chain efficiency.

It’s an exciting time for the 3PL industry, as the potential for manufacturers and retailers to increase their reliance on outsourced logistics grows. The key to lasting success for 3PLs will be to look beyond short-term, tactical logistics services to become a strategic partner focused on helping customers deal with the volatility of omni-channel.

The only way 3PLs can do this is through being able to provide intelligent customer insights. Those that adapt to this new world will thrive as true strategic partners, retain more customers and become leaner organisations. The smaller fish will also become more attractive bidding prospects. However, the time is now for these changes to be made – the marketplace won’t wait.

3PL vs 4PL vs 5PL Services: What Are the Differences?,https://www.eshipper.com/blog/3pl-vs-4pl-vs-5pl-services-what-are-the-differences/,30 мая 2024 г.,"If you depend on logistics services when running your business, chances are you’ve come across the terms 3PL, 4PL, and 5PL. While these terms are often used interchangeably, each actually represents a different level of logistics outsourcing and supply chain management.

To help you become well-versed in the nuances of these service levels, we’ve put together this guide to 3PL vs 4PL vs 5PL, so you can determine which is the right choice to enhance your supply chain efficiency.

Let’s dive in.

What is 3PL (Third-Party Logistics)?

A 3PL or Third-Party Logistics provider offers services such as transportation, warehousing, picking and packing, and freight forwarding.

The key features of 3PL include:

Specialized Services:

3PL providers offer specialized logistics services tailored to meet the unique needs of their clients.

Scalability:

Companies can scale their logistics operations up or down based on their needs, without the need to invest in additional infrastructure.

Cost-Effectiveness:

Outsourcing logistics functions to a 3PL provider can often be more cost-effective than managing these functions in-house.

Many 3PLs focus on just one core element of logistics services. For your business, this means that you may end up having to partner with several 3PLs to ensure that all your logistics needs are met.

What is 4PL (Fourth-Party Logistics)?

A 4PL or Fourth-Party Logistics provider takes logistics outsourcing further by adding a layer of management and coordination to the supply chain. In this arrangement, your 4PL partner may offer some of the same services as a 3PL while also taking on the role of managing multiple 3PL providers and becoming the single point of contact for your business.

The key features of 4PL logistics services are:

Supply Chain Integration:

4PL providers integrate and manage the entire supply chain, including multiple 3PL providers, to improve efficiency and reduce costs.

Technology Integration:

4PL providers often use advanced technology, such as cloud-based platforms and analytics, to optimize the supply chain.

Strategic Planning:

4PL providers work closely with clients to develop and implement strategic supply chain solutions.

3PL VS 4PL

So what is the difference between 3PL and 4PL?

While 3PL providers offer valuable logistics services to support your business’s supply chain needs, they typically act as intermediaries between your business and the transportation or warehouse providers you’re outsourcing your logistics to.

4PL providers, on the other hand, manage your entire logistics process, often overseeing multiple 3PLs. The main difference of 4PL logistics services is that they integrate the resources, capabilities, and technology of their own organization and other organizations (including 3PLs) to design, build, and run comprehensive supply chain solutions for their clients. This can include strategic planning, consulting, and optimization services to improve supply chain efficiency.

What is 5PL (Fifth-Party Logistics)?

5PL, or Fifth-Party Logistics, is a relatively new concept that goes beyond the management of physical goods to include the management of information and financial flows. 5PL providers offer end-to-end supply chain solutions, integrating all aspects of the supply chain, including logistics, procurement, and inventory management.

The key features of 5PL include:

End-to-End Solutions:

5PL providers offer comprehensive end-to-end supply chain solutions, including logistics, procurement, and inventory management.

Advanced Technology:

5PL providers use advanced technology, such as artificial intelligence and blockchain, to optimize the supply chain and improve visibility.

Risk Management:

5PL providers help clients manage risks associated with supply chain disruptions, such as natural disasters or geopolitical events.

4PL VS 5PL

There are several differences between 4PL and 5PL services.

A 4PL provider often works with multiple 3PLs to coordinate and optimize supply chain operations, essentially acting as a higher-level supply chain integrator that manages and oversees your entire logistics network. In doing so, your 4PL partner provides you with strategic direction, designs your supply chain solutions, and manages relationships with various logistics service providers carrying out your supply chain operations.

A 5PL provider, on the other hand, goes beyond the role of a 4PL by not only managing your logistics network but also leveraging advanced technologies like AI, IoT, and blockchain to further optimize your supply chain operations.They do this by using data-driven insights and technologies to drive efficiency, visibility, and collaboration across the entire supply chain ecosystem.

Takeaway: 3PL vs 4PL vs 5 PL

While 3PL focuses on specialized logistics services, 4PL adds a layer of management and coordination, and 5PL provides comprehensive end-to-end supply chain solutions. So how can you make an informed decision when outsourcing your logistics operations? Your choice will depend on where you are on your business journey and on your logistics needs at any given stage.

If you’re a smaller business experiencing rapid growth, working with a 3PL can help you scale more efficiently by handling your order fulfillment process, from eCommerce warehousing to inventory management, picking and packing, and shipping.

But if your business is reaching enterprise level, you may be ready for a 4PL logistics service provider that can manage your supply chain for you.

And while both 4PL and 5PL providers focus on managing and optimizing supply chain operations, if you run an enterprise business operating in a complex, global supply chain and require advanced logistics solutions, a 5PL service provider might be the solution you need. That’s because 5PLs leverage advanced technologies to drive even greater efficiency, visibility, and collaboration across your supply chain.

3 Logistics Improvements Automotive Manufacturers ...,https://www.brwilliams.com/blog/3pl-improvements-automotive-manufacturers/,N/A,"Do you know what goes on behind the scenes to keep top automotive brands best-in-class?

Major automotive companies (including the biggest and best in the industry) are quietly powered by warehousing, trucking, and 3PL logistics companies in the American Southeast.

Automotive industry suppliers and OEMs rely on strategic automotive logistics solutions to ensure their supply chain operates efficiently and effectively, freeing valuable resources that can be allocated elsewhere. As a supply chain management firm in the Southeast, BR Williams is blessed to serve many world-class automotive industry clients.

Why Automotive Suppliers Use 3PL Logistics Services:

Automotive businesses have unique reasons for using 3rd party logistics (3PL) companies that include (but are not limited to):

Facility size – If a company doesn’t have a warehouse, or has a fluctuating product volume throughout the year, it might be in their best interest to use a 3PL company that can bend and flex to fit their changing needs and space requirements.

– If a company doesn’t have a warehouse, or has a fluctuating product volume throughout the year, it might be in their best interest to use a 3PL company that can bend and flex to fit their changing needs and space requirements. Fleet size – For schedule-driven JIT supply chain needs with static volumes, there is no better solution than a dedicated fleet. However, given volume fluctuations, without a flexible 3PL solution component, companies find themselves at times either short on trucks, or paying for trucks that are not being utilized.

However, given volume fluctuations, without a flexible 3PL solution component, companies find themselves at times either short on trucks, or paying for trucks that are not being utilized. Staff size – It is easier to use a 3PL logistics provider if the current staff required is not available or if a full staff is not required throughout the entire year

– It is easier to use a 3PL logistics provider if the current staff required is not available or if a full staff is not required throughout the entire year One-Stop Shop Services – It is uncommon for businesses to be equipped with the facility, resources and staff needed to manage the nitty gritty details of not only automotive parts trucking, but warehousing, and logistics. Accessing complementary solutions via multiple providers can prove inefficient, inconsistent and chaotic.

– It is uncommon for businesses to be equipped with the facility, resources and staff needed to manage the nitty gritty details of not only automotive parts trucking, but warehousing, and logistics. Accessing complementary solutions via multiple providers can prove inefficient, inconsistent and chaotic. Dry-Bulk Chemicals – Transporting and storing plastic resin and other dry bulk loads of chemicals can be complicated. Automotive logistics companies (like BR Williams) have the equipment and experience needed to deal with these components.

3 Short Case Studies: Improvements in Automotive Logistics

Here are some case studies that demonstrate how global automotive companies are winning by using 3PL and custom logistics solutions to seamlessly facilitate their day-to-day operations. These are 3 of our automotive clients (for client confidentiality, we’ve removed company names).

Company “A”:

Company A is a well-known global automotive company that needed a 3PL logistics company that could handle all aspects of logistics, trucking, and warehousing to support company A’s day-to-day operations in the Southeast.

BR Williams was already an established service provider in the area with the capacity to handle their product and remain flexible while addressing new challenges and opportunities.

Often, logistics companies are restricted to working exclusively with tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers versus the OEM. In this case, BR Williams had the skill and resources to work directly with company A to move, store, manage and distribute both large and tiny automotive parts.

Company A is one of the largest names in the automotive industry, and BR Williams is proud to offer this best-in-class OEM options and the ability to scale their operations within our just-in-time facility without committing to major capital investments.

Company “B”:

Company B is a tier 1 automotive supplier that needed to partner with a logistics company that possessed the expertise, space and systems to re-package product, perform quality inspections, do simple repairs and ship the product directly to their customers.

Company B also required that the logistics partner accept incremental business without the need to secure additional space.

Today, BR Williams receives company B’s heavy-duty corrugated boxes in ocean containers (think intermodal drayage), unloads the parts, performs an inspection, and places the parts in storage. Company B then sends the demand for the next day and begins the re-packaging process. This process includes staging, performing a secondary redundant inspection, part transportation, labeling, tracking, pulling of defective parts, minor repairs on parts, and digital tracking through the warehouse management system (WMS).

Currently, BR Williams packages over 30,000 automotive parts for company B per month and houses their operations using 10,000-15,000 square feet of BR Williams-owned warehouse space.

As a result, company B has been able to acquire new business at a profitability and volume not previously possible without the resources of BR Williams.

Company “C”:

Company C is also a supplier to the automotive industry and needed a 3PL company who knew the automotive industry well and could re-package, assemble, manage, and move automotive parts. They had multiple concerns that needed to be addressed:

Company C had the infrastructure for packaging large numbers of single parts automatically, but did not have the infrastructure to handle large and bulky parts. The cost of resetting the equipment after each run was too high and negatively affected productivity.

Short-runs were given the lowest priority, meaning that customers were receiving product consistently late. Unhappy customers, in the digital age of online reviews, can ruin a company’s reputation.

Volumes fluctuated throughout the year, which made warehousing needs difficult to forecast. Also, this means that during certain times of the year, company C would be paying for space they weren’t using.

BR Williams offered company C logistics solutions to solve the identified problems. Now, Company C has freed-up space that they were previously using to warehouse product. They have also saved costs when considering the needed staff, space, and waste management.

Company C can keep in-house packaging down to a minimum, and focus on their core competencies and objectives. Their product is delivered on time and they don’t pay for unused space during slow periods.

Ultimately, company C saves time and money in several ways by using BR Williams.

Third-Party Logistics Companies' Impact on Industrial Real ...,https://elmtreefunds.com/reports/1143/,N/A,"Due to growing competition for e-commerce sales, retailers and wholesalers are focused on expanding their supply chain operations. While some companies have the in-house capabilities needed to manage the logistics and transportation of their products, many corporations are unable to manage them in an efficient manner. Thus, many companies are outsourcing this business function to a third-party that specializes in supply chain optimization.

Third-party logistics (or “3PL”) refers to a company that provides outsourced supply chain services such as providing inbound freight management, distribution services, warehousing, order fulfillment, and outbound freight management. Additionally, a 3PL company may provide other specialized services such as inventory management, cross-docking, packaging, and last-mile delivery.

3PLs have had a profound impact on leasing activity and the underlying demand fundamentals associated with industrial real estate.

Finding Space to Grow: The 3 Strategies Helping 3PLs ...,https://www.greyorange.com/3pl/finding-space-to-grow-the-3-strategies-helping-3pls-sustain-market-momentum/,N/A,"In 2021, 74% of third-party logistics companies (3PLs) were struggling to find and keep customers. In 2022, that number fell to just 23%.

Numerous factors are contributing to this 3PL boom. For one, warehouse space is in serious demand. Each incremental $1 billion in ecommerce growth requires an additional 1.25 million square feet of distribution space. And with nearly 96% of existing space in the U.S. already in use, rents for lease renewals are increasing at a whopping rate of 25%, according to CBRE data.

At the same time, the warehouse labor situation is only getting worse with each passing year. The U.S. warehouse and transportation industry had a record 490,000 openings in July 2022, a gap predicted to widen. Despite an increase in pay and perks, the physical strain of warehouse work makes it unappealing and unsustainable for an aging workforce. And as boomers continue to retire and global populations shrink, the pool of available workers is becoming increasingly limited.

3PL growth trends

With warehouse space at a premium and the ecommerce surge and labor challenges showing no sign of slowing, it’s no surprise that over 40% of companies have increased their usage of and reliance on global 3PLs over the past few years. Ahead, we explore three trends that can help 3PLs capitalize on this growth, meet demanding delivery expectations and drive innovation.

1. Automation, minus the risk

It’s like the chicken or the egg dilemma. Do you boost your warehouse automation capabilities as a strategic initiative (and a way to entice new clients)? Or should you acquire the clients first and design your warehouse automation around their needs?

3PLs have traditionally shied away from large-scale investments in warehouse automation, primarily because the payback period was often longer than a client contract. Suppose a client was to switch to a different 3PL after a few years, before any ROI was realized from the automation deployed. And because fixed automation systems lack the inherent flexibility to easily adapt to the process flows of a different client, the 3PL is stuck with an automation system that is barely useful, let alone driving any value.

But automation looks different today. The modular capabilities of Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) running on multibot orchestration platforms enable simple modifications to switch from one client to another. Vertical space utilization maximizes facility use and can be easily changed and reconfigured. And RaaS and SaaS models allow 3PLs to deploy fulfillment automation without a significant upfront investment.

In addition to de-risking that first step into automation, an as-a-service model offers financial flexibility, enables faster deployment and allows 3PLs to achieve ROI in months instead of years.

2. Multi-client fulfillment to maximize warehouse space and labor

As an increasing number of retailers turn to 3PLs to provide same, next or two-day deliveries, goods need to move through the fulfillment process quickly and efficiently. Multi-client centers can help 3PLs not only fulfill faster but also reduce labor, space and transportation needs – with an average cost savings of 7-9%.

In “The promise and challenge of multi-client fulfillment for e-commerce,” McKinsey explores the value proposition of two different approaches to multi-client fulfillment. A partially integrated model enables labor sharing across both integrated and client specific functions. Successful operations are dependent on solutions that connect systems, people and automation to facilitate coordinated decision making across clients.

Fully integrated multi-client models have the potential to garner even greater cost savings, flexibility and process optimization through efficient space utilization and resource sharing throughout the entire warehouse. For example, processing inventory across clients at receiving docks increases worker and bot efficiency. Or workers (robot or human) can pick items from all inventory and utilize the same pack stations and packaging materials for all clients.

The fully integrated model typically leverages artificial intelligence and machine learning for decision-making and planning, especially in areas like demand and labor management. Automated solutions, such as assisted picking, goods to person and dock to stock, should run on an AMR multibot orchestration platform that can coordinate bots and software from multiple vendors.

3. The 4PL connection

Supply chain disruptions have been a constant since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the overall coordination and strategic integration of all supply chain vendors and processes has become imperative and companies are turning to fourth-party logistics providers (4PLs) at record-setting rates. The global 4PL logistics market was estimated at $57.65 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach $84.43 billion by 2026, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.5%.

Overseeing the entire supply chain and coordinating the activities of multiple 3PLs and service providers, 4PLs take a strategic approach to managing the end-to-end logistics process for their clients.

3PL OPERATOR: DETAILS YOU NEED TO KNOW,https://synexlogistics.com/articles/3pl-operator-details-you-need-to-know/,N/A,"Businesses looking into supply chain optimization often face some issues when choosing a provider. It is difficult to decide on the specific types of required logistics services, considering that this influences customer satisfaction and can possibly lead to losing millions of dollars. What is 3PL and how can it help your company? Learn more from this article.

Nature of the transportation industry

Logistics sphere offers various types of outsourcing services. The terms 3PL, 4PL, and even 5PL are used more often than ever. These simple illustrations will help you understand more about each of them.

3PL operator: example 3PL implies a third-party logistics model, which makes it possible for the business to retain control, while transportation and other delivery operations are outsourced to another company. It may delegate all or part of the services to contractors. As part of this cooperation, the operator offers additional services like packing in crates, boxes, etc. This adds value to the chain of supply. For example, a farmer who transports apples from his farm through a 3PL operator can also order them to be packed in boxes. Such operations are becoming more and more popular in various countries of the world, including Ukraine. SYNEX LOGISTICS is a well-known Ukrainian 3PL operator. It offers contract, transportation , project and exhibition, as well as customs brokerage services. What is 3PL?

The concept of a third-party logistics services provider emerged in the 70s. 3PL means that in addition to the recipient, shipper and carrier of the goods, another company takes part in transportation. This entity does not get the right of ownership over the cargo, it only acts as an intermediary between the customer and the transportation company. At first, 3PL was considered to be a part of intermodal marketing services. Such companies acted as intermediaries between the shippers and railway operators and were listed in the contract as third parties. Currently, any format of hired logistics services constitutes the 3PL and covers the transportation of: parts, raw materials, goods from suppliers to manufacturers;

end products from the manufacturer to the distributor or retail store. A 3PL operator may not own warehouses, trucks or other assets. Sometimes it acts as a broker, but its field of activities is usually wider. 3PL includes the following services: transportation;

warehouse operations;

acceptance and transfer of cargo without storing it (cross-docking);

stock management;

packaging;

freight forwarding activities. Specific types of services are determined by the strategic requirements of the customer who develops rules for transportation and storage of products and materials. 3PL: benefits for business A 3PL provider is an intermediary with experience in various industries. It can customize services according to the customer’s needs and offer technological solutions. It includes adjusting a supply chain that has become too complex to manage it independently because of mergers, acquisitions or other reasons. Specializing in logistics, the operator offers special valuable tools that the customer cannot invest in on his own – systems for running the transportation, warehouse and other operations. Long-term relations and large-scale operations allow to save on reduced prices, fees, cost of packaging materials and additional services. SYNEX Logistics",3PL startup strategic investment
Picking the Right 3PL Warehouse | 3PL Fulfillment,https://shipbots.com/post/picking-3pl-location/,N/A,"Determining the correct location for your third party logistics (3PL) warehouse and fulfillment center is arguably one of the most critical decisions that you will ever make regarding your logistics. Speed of receipt of inbound goods, quickness of delivery of orders to customers throughout the globe, cost of freight and product pricing, avoidance of environmental disasters, and general managerial oversight are all impacted by this one decision. Furthermore, your choice of an outsourced warehouse location is a decision that can’t easily be changed. Switching 3PL companies is highly complex and costly, so getting it right the first time is paramount to success.

But what are the most important factors to consider when choosing the best 3PL location? In this article, we will analyze the following key questions to land the right warehouse location the first time:

Where is your product coming from?

Where are your customers located?

Do you need a company with a single warehouse or multiple locations?

Are environmental factors going to impact your selection?

Should the 3PL warehouse be near you?

Where is Your Product Coming From?

Inbound receipt of goods to the 3PL warehouse impacts not only the landed cost of your product (including inbound freight), but also the speed with which the product can be received into the warehouse and prepared for shipping to your customers. For US and Canadian sellers, there are generally two options for sourcing products – either locally sourced or globally sourced overseas.

Locally sourced products are more easily forwarded to the warehouse, as the distance to ship the product is far smaller and there are no other obstacles to receiving the product, such as custom clearance and drayage to the warehouse. Locally produced goods can simply be shipped by LTL or parcel freight from the supplier to the warehouse. In this case, the cost of inbound freight is lower and the timeframe to deliver the product to your warehouse is quicker than receiving containers from overseas. While it might still be worth considering a 3PL warehouse that is closer to the manufacturer or supplier, the choice might not be as impactful as would be the case in globally sourced scenarios.

Globally sourced products bring with them a greater challenge in some respects, as inbound freight costs are significantly higher than when locally sourced and can take significantly longer to forward to the warehouse. It’s no surprise, for example, that merchants who purchase products from East Asia often bring their products into either southern California in the US or British Columbia in Canada. Not only are costs minimized by choosing a location closer to production, but shipping times to the warehouse also decrease, allowing sales orders to be released quicker.

But inbound freight isn’t the only factor to consider, so let’s look at the remaining questions to make a comprehensive decision.

Where are Your Customers Located?

Analyzing your outbound freight costs and delivery time is equally important when weighing your options. If your customers are spread throughout the country, a centrally located 3PL may be best for your business. However, if your customers are concentrated in a certain region or local market or if you heavily invest in regional marketing, choosing a 3PL in that specific area may make more sense. Finally, if you have global customers, there may be a need to relocate inventory in that global market to overcome customers’ objections related to delivery times and costs and to improve your international shipping strategy.

In the case of startups, sales are unknown and therefore must be estimated. Some of the most important ways to make a wise choice when sales volumes aren’t known include market and product testing, and estimating marketing spend relative to the potential geographic sales market.

Do You Need a Company with a Single Warehouse or Multiple Locations?

Multiple location warehousing has become a very popular topic in logistics these days. The theory is that customers have such a high expectation related to delivery time frames that spreading inventory into regional locations helps meet and exceed customer expectations. Thanks to companies like Amazon, customer’s expectations have heightened significantly, up to and including expectations of delivery within days or hours.

In some cases, splitting inventory can be a helpful tool, but for other scenarios it just isn’t as beneficial. Where is a multiple location strategy most beneficial? The below cases are best suited for potentially distributing inventory across warehouses:

High order volumes per month

Temperature sensitive products

Other products with a high degree of time sensitivity of delivery, such as some medical and health related goods

In other cases, such as lower order volumes being shipped per month and non-time sensitive goods, the additional cost of carrying more inventory in multiple locations doesn’t justify the benefits achieved by this strategy. Therefore, for many businesses, using a single, regional 3PL warehouse location is best.

Are Environmental Factors Going to Impact Your Selection?

Environmental factors can have an impact on your ideal 3PL location. For companies with products that can be adversely impacted by extreme heat or cold conditions, locating a warehouse in a more temperate environment is helpful. While there are specialized 3PL warehouses with climate-controlled conditions, this additional level of service comes at a higher cost. Unless the product needs air-conditioned, humidity-controlled, cold storage or frozen storage conditions, finding a warehouse in an area of the country that matches the temperature and environmental conditions needed for your product will save your company money.

Sometimes, companies prefer to have a 3PL warehouse as a secondary backup facility in case of an emergency, in which case they need to locate a warehouse in another area separate from their in-house warehouse or company headquarters. In other situations, companies prefer to use a warehouse in an area that isn’t susceptible to natural disasters such as tornadoes, earthquakes, etc. Taking environmental factors into consideration will help your business make a more comprehensive choice.

Should the 3PL Warehouse be Near You?

Simply put – some companies prefer to be near their 3PL warehouse, while others don’t see the need to take location into consideration. This is more of a psychological factor than anything else. Ask yourself this question – do you feel the need to have more control over your logistics? If so, being near the facility so that you can build a closer relationship with the company and drop by as needed may help ease your mind and achieve the desired level of accountability.

However, others may have no need to drop by the 3PL facility nor do they feel they can’t maintain a similar level of performance without dropping by, especially with the growth of online collaboration tools such as Zoom. After careful consideration, if the best location for your 3PL warehouse isn’t near you, keeping an open mind about having a 3PL in a different area of the country can ultimately help reduce overall transit times and costs.

Warehouse “Fit” is Extremely Important

All of this considered, there is one big caveat to keep in mind. It is wise not to compromise on the right “fit” of a warehouse. For example, if you need a very specific type of fulfillment service and it is in a reasonably close area (not necessarily your top choice) and it is the perfect fit for your company, it might be good to consider it regardless of location.

Top Locations for 3PL Warehousing in the US, Canada, and Europe

Are you wondering where some of the top locations are for warehousing and fulfillment in the US, Canada, and Europe? Below are the most popular areas:

Best US Locations for 3PL Warehouses

Southern California

Tri-state area (New Jersey, New York, Connecticut)

Central US (areas such as Chicago, Dallas, Houston, and St. Louis)

For inbound shipping from overseas, southern California (and specifically, Los Angeles area) is by far the most popular area for a 3PL warehouse, but it isn’t the only popular location. Due to its highly concentrated population, the Northeast US is a viable option as well. Having a central location for eCommerce fulfillment with equal shipping times and costs throughout the US is another popular option.

Best Canadian Locations for 3PL Warehouses

Toronto area

Vancouver

Because of the heavy population in the greater Toronto area (GTA), it’s no surprise that it is by far the most popular area for 3PL warehouses in Canada. However, for a similar reason as southern California, British Columbia is a great location for minimizing inbound freight costs into Canada.

Best European Locations for 3PL Warehouses

For US and Canadian companies that need additional support for shipping European orders, there are a few popular locations to choose from. First and foremost, due to their English-speaking cultures, both the United Kingdom and Ireland offer convenient customs with the ability to communicate easily with the 3PL staff. Another great option is the Netherlands, as the country boasts a central European location as well as a beneficial business, customs, and tax climate.

Key Takeaway

After doing your research and carefully considering all the factors, you will be able to pinpoint the ideal location where your 3PL should be situated. Keep in mind inbound and outbound shipping, the optimal number of warehouses, environmental factors, and the need for close physical proximity to your business to make the best decision.",3PL startup strategic investment

As a result, businesses are free to concentrate on their core competencies without worrying about the additional strain of scaling their supply chain operations.

Access to technology

3PL companies can access advanced technologies and tools to improve supply chain visibility, tracking, and efficiency. These tools and technologies can provide real-time data, automate processes, and help companies make more informed decisions.

Flexibility

3PL providers can offer a range of customised services and solutions to meet a company’s specific needs. This flexibility spares businesses the hassle of investing in supply chain infrastructure allowing them to select only the services they need.

Better risk management

By outsourcing to a 3PL provider, companies can reduce the risks associated with their supply chain operations. By offering solutions to challenges like logistics, transportation management, and contract negotiation, 3PL providers can assist businesses in optimising their supply chains.

For organisations on the digital transformation journey, agility is key in responding to a rapidly changing technology and business landscape.

A Causal Model to Find the Relationships Between 3PL ...,https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/a-causal-model-to-find-the-relationships-between-3pl-service-providers-and-the-performance-of-the-logistics-process-in-mexican-manufacturing-companies/239058,Автор: L Avelar-Sosa,"Abstract

Chapter Preview Top Background As the international exchange backbone, logistics comprises transportation, warehouses, cross-border crossings, and payment systems, among other functions that are commonly performed by private service providers; in order to support private operators and merchandise owners; which are also essential for governments and regional and international organizations (Önsel & Ülengin 2016). Due to the population increment that industrial growth has brought, the 3PL function has become relevant in the logistics sector currently (Baligil et al., 2011). The services and the complexity of the supply chain has had a huge progress as a result of multiple suppliers and customers involved in it, which have recently led to the use of service companies to support the logistics management. In addition, these companies are known as 3PL, which offer different strategies to reduce transportation times and product distribution. Also, several studies mention that supply chains will be effective until logistic companies identify, measure, and control their performance elements when offering those services which development should consider the flow of functions in an interrelated manner, and not only as individual activities (Kayakutlu & Buyukozkan 2011). Internationally, the logistics industry can be considered as the base arteries of economic development, therefore as the logistics outsourcing as a main aspect in business. Nevertheless, in recent years, the integration and promotion of 3PL professional services within the supply chain have increased (Huang et al. 2015). For most of the manufacturing firms, logistics is neither their core competency nor a core business function, but an essential function for them to gain competitive advantage (Bulgurcu & Nakiboglu, 2018).

Platform vs. 3PL Financing: Strategic Choice of Lending ...,https://kar.kent.ac.uk/104963,Автор: SB Rath,"Rath, Sambit Brata, Govindan, Kannan, Mandal, Prasenjit, Basu, P (2024) Platform vs. 3PL Financing: Strategic Choice of Lending Model for an E-tailer Under Operational Risk.

In addition to providing logistics services, third-party logistics (3PL) firms (e.g., S.F. Express) have recently started extending financial services to capital-constrained e-tailers (referred to as 3PL financing (LF)). Another novel financing mode available for e-tailers is platform financing (PF), in which online platforms such as Amazon and Alibaba provide loans to e-tailers on their platforms. Both LF and PF facilitate trade in a capital-constrained supply chain. However, in the presence of an e-tailer’s operational risk, the lenders are exposed to credit risk, which can negatively impact the whole supply chain. Moreover, when both financing modes are available, the e-tailer must develop an optimal borrowing strategy. Multiple factors, such as bankruptcy cost, referral fee, and shipping fee, can significantly influence players’ financing decisions. Therefore, this paper examines supply chain members’ optimal operational and financing decisions under LF and PF. We study a three-tier supply chain in which an e-tailer, exposed to operational risk, procures a product from a supplier via the 3PL firm and resells it to end customers through the online platform. The e-tailer obtains the working capital either through LF or PF. We find that at low (high) levels of operational risk, the e-tailer chooses LF (PF). Surprisingly, the platform and the 3PL firm do not always benefit from the PF and LF. We recommend a decision support framework for the e-tailer’s optimal financing strategy for different product categories based on its operational risk. We show that for products with a low (moderate and high) referral fee, LF (PF) achieves a win-win-win outcome under low (high) operational risk. Further analysis shows that the e-tailer’s initial working capital, logistics and product costs can alter the players’ financing decisions.",3PL startup strategic investment

Logistics costs consist of unit cost and volume, elements which must be controlled efficiently. But since the logistics department manages and carries out logistics operations, the only element it can control is lowering unit cost. Volume cannot be controlled, and there are also limits to how low unit cost can go.

Meanwhile, volume is determined based on production and sales department-related restrictions, such as production plans, delivery conditions and so on.

Therefore, overall optimization of SCM by cutting logistics costs depends not just on the logistics department but must also involve the production and sales departments.

The Rise of Third-Party Logistics (3PL) in California,https://fulfillmenthubusa.com/the-rise-of-third-party-logistics-3pl-in-california-efficient-solutions-for-businesses/,N/A,"The Rise of Third-Party Logistics (3PL) in California: Efficient Solutions for Businesses

In recent years, the logistics industry has seen a rapid growth in demand for efficient and reliable solutions. As businesses continue to expand their operations, they often face challenges in storing and distributing their products. This is where third-party logistics (3PL) providers come into play, offering a wide range of services to help businesses streamline their supply chain management. California, being a major hub for commerce and trade, has witnessed a significant rise in the popularity of 3PL services. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind this rise and how businesses can benefit from partnering with a 3PL provider.

Why California is a Hotspot for 3PL Services

California’s strategic location on the West Coast of the United States makes it an ideal gateway for international trade. With major ports such as the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach, the state serves as a key entry point for goods coming from Asia and other parts of the world. This geographical advantage has attracted numerous businesses to set up their distribution centers and warehouses in California, leading to an increased demand for 3PL services.

Efficient Warehousing and Distribution Solutions

One of the key reasons why businesses choose to partner with 3PL providers in California is the access to efficient warehousing and distribution solutions. Third-party logistics companies offer state-of-the-art facilities that are equipped with advanced technology and systems to manage inventory, track shipments, and optimize storage space. This allows businesses to focus on their core competencies while leaving the logistics operations to the experts.

Additionally, 3PL providers in California have a deep understanding of local market dynamics and can offer tailored solutions to meet the specific needs of businesses. Whether it’s e-commerce fulfillment, cross-docking, or inventory management, 3PL providers have the expertise to handle a wide range of logistics requirements.

Scalability and Flexibility

Another advantage of partnering with a 3PL provider in California is the scalability and flexibility it offers. As businesses grow, their logistics needs may change, requiring additional warehouse space or a different distribution strategy. 3PL providers can easily accommodate these changes and scale up or down their operations accordingly. This eliminates the need for businesses to invest in infrastructure and resources that may become underutilized in the long run.

Cost Savings and Efficiency

Outsourcing logistics operations to a 3PL provider in California can result in significant cost savings for businesses. By leveraging economies of scale, 3PL providers can negotiate better rates with carriers, leading to lower transportation costs. Additionally, businesses can avoid the upfront investment in warehouse infrastructure, labor, and technology, which can be quite expensive. Instead, they can pay a fixed fee to the 3PL provider based on the services utilized, allowing for better cost control and predictability.

FAQs:

Q: What types of businesses can benefit from partnering with a 3PL provider in California?

A: Businesses of all sizes and industries can benefit from partnering with a 3PL provider in California. From small e-commerce startups to large multinational corporations, 3PL providers offer tailored solutions to meet the unique logistics requirements of each business.

Q: How can 3PL providers help businesses expand their operations?

A: 3PL providers in California have the infrastructure and expertise to support businesses in expanding their operations. Whether it’s opening new distribution centers, entering new markets, or launching new product lines, 3PL providers can provide the necessary logistics support to ensure a smooth expansion process.

Q: Can businesses retain control over their logistics operations when partnering with a 3PL provider?

A: Yes, businesses can retain control over their logistics operations when partnering with a 3PL provider. While the 3PL provider takes care of the day-to-day logistics tasks, businesses still have visibility and control over their inventory, shipments, and overall supply chain through advanced tracking and reporting systems provided by the 3PL provider.

Q: How can businesses find the right 3PL provider in California?

A: Finding the right 3PL provider in California requires careful evaluation of their capabilities, industry experience, and track record.

"What are 1PL, 2PL, 3PL, 4PL, and 5PL? - Abivin",https://www.abivin.com/blog/blog-5/what-are-1pl-2pl-3pl-4pl-and-5pl-1658,26 мая 2024 г.,"In this article, we will go into detail about the differences between 1PL, 2PL, 3PL, 4PL and 5PL in Logistics.

1PL: 1st Party Logistics

1st Party Logistics

First-party logistics service provider is a firm or an individual that needs to have cargo, freight, goods, products or merchandise transported from point A to point B. The term first-party logistics provider stands both for the cargo sender and for the cargo receiver. A 1PL can be companies considered as self-logistics like manufacturer, trader, importer/exporter, wholesaler, retailer or distributor in the international commerce field. It can also be institution such a government department or an individual or family removing from one place to another. Anyone having goods moved from their place of origin to their new place is considered to be first-party logistics provider.

2PL: 2nd Party Logistics

2nd Party Logistics

Second-party logistics involves the transport of goods from a particular transport area of the supply chain like rail, road, sea or air. Second-party logistics providers are the asset-based carriers and includes transport using ships of own lease and airlines that they are contracted with. They are mainly used for international transportation of heavy and wholesale goods and for trading purpose as well. For example, 2PL can be freight forwarders, freight brokers, customs brokers, export management companies, exporting trading companies, shipping associations, shipper’s agents, export packing companies, etc.

2PL is the actual carrier, such as shipping lines, airlines, car carriers. Therefore 2PL service providers often own and use specialized means of transport to cater to their specific transport work, take on the role of transport of a particular stage or provide a single shipping service in the logistics chain of a client company. For example, the major shipping companies in the world such as Wan Hai, Maersk, Yang Ming and EverGreen are big corporations specializing in shipping goods by ships. They can be considered 2PLs which only handles the transport role of a particular stage or provides single transport services in the entire logistics chain of a customer company.

3PL: 3rd Party Logistics

Third-party logistics service providers are broadly referred to as external suppliers who perform part of or all logistics functions that are not performed by in-house logistics professionals.

When 3PLs began to gain popularity in the 1970s, their functions centered on operation, warehousing, and transportation services. By the late 2000s, they included with their warehouse and transportation services activities such as production or procurement of goods, order fulfillment, labeling, packaging, assembling, kitting, reverse logistics, information technology services, customs brokering, cross-docking, and forwarding.

Compare to others, 3PLs have some certain advantages:

Use of logistics experts rather than in-house staff

Easier adaptation to technology advances

Flexibility of location, offerings, resources, and workforce

Most cost-effective

Quicker to add capabilities

By using 3PL service providers, companies could potentially lose out on

Control over transportation logistics

Development of cheaper and more efficient pricing models

Independence

3PL service providers are commonly segregated into one of five categories: transportation, warehouse/distribution, forwarder, financial, or information technology.

Transportation: Most transportation-based 3PLs are subsidiaries of larger organizations, such as FedEx Supply Chain Services or UPS Supply Chain Solutions.

Warehouse/distribution: Likely the first of the 3PL service providers, these facility-based operations have transitioned into integrated logistics and have significant experience in logistics management. Organizations in this category include IBM Supply Chain Management, Ozburn-Hessey Logistics, and Intral Corporation.

Forwarder: These 3PL service providers have expanded their middleman roles as forwarders into a broader range of 3PL services.

Financial: These 3PL service providers offer freight payment, auditing, cost accounting and control, and logistics management tools. Financial-based 3PLs include GE Information Services, AIMS Logistics, and Cass Information Systems.

Information Technology: The newest and a growing type of 3PL service providers, IT 3PLs represent transportation and logistics services for internet-based, business-to-business, and electronic markets.

For example: DHL and FedEx are the leading companies in providing global logistics services, including services from shipping by air to air, planning and optimization of transportation networks, agent management, security system management, Incoterm, cargo insurance, etc.

4PL: 4th Party Logistics

Comparison between 3PL and 4PL

Image Source

Fourth-party logistics service providers emerged in the mid-1990s as companies with the primary purpose of ensuring that all elements of the supply chain, are working toward the same, relevant supply chain goals and objectives. A fourth-party provider is a non-asset-owning company that works with multiple resources, including 3PLs, to manage planning and technology for a client’s logistics system. The 4PL is a logistics management service, acting as a coordinator for these different services, including the design, build, and execution of supply chain solutions.

Fourth-party logistics differs from third-party logistics in the following ways:

The 4PL organization is often a separate entity formed by a joint venture or other long-term contract between a client and one or more partners

The 4PL organization is an interface between the client and multiple logistics services providers

Ideally, all aspects of the client’s supply chain are managed by the 4PL organization

It is possible for a major 3PL organization to form a 4PL organization within its existing structure

The 4PL’s goal is to provide value across an entire supply chain, not just one segment of the chain. 4PL’s services are determined by customer needs. A successful 4PL, service provider requires a strong strategy, composed of:

Leadership: The 4PL manages the project, including services, systems, and information.

Management: The 4PL manages the multiple 3PLs as well as day-to-day operations

Information Technology: The 4PL manages the full integration and support of all the systems within the supply chain.

Assets: The 4PL manages transportation, warehouses, contract manufacturing, packing, and procurement services.

For example, some companies are currently providing 4PL services such as UPS, XPO Logistics, and Geodis Wilson company. In 4PL, the company or representative organization will be authorized by the customer as a manager, focusing on improving process efficiency and implementing the entire supply chain and logistics. Therefore, 4PL is increasingly becoming one of the key positions in the business activities of the business.

5PL: 5th Party Logistics

Fifth-party logistics service provider is also known as a logistics aggregator. They will aggregate the demands of the 3PL and others into bulk volume for getting better rates with different types of airlines and shipping companies. This type of logistics is not asset based. It usually works seamlessly across all disciplines.

In recent years, 5PL is considered as the most popular and developed logistics service for e-commerce today. 5PL manages and coordinates the activities of 3PLs and 4PLs through information solutions related to supply and demand in e-commerce delivery market. The characteristics of 5PL are the systems (Order Management System (OMS), Warehouse Management System (WMS) and Transport Management System (TMS) These three systems are closely related together in a unified system and information technology.

Conclusion

1PLs are businesses that invest in their own means of transportation, support tools and available resources, human resources to organize and carry out logistics activities to meet their needs. 2PL focuses on providing single services, contributing to a small aspect of the customer's supply chain. Usually 2PLs are sea, land or air carriers. Regarding 3PL and 4PL, in general, both activities are involved in the supply chain activities from input materials to output products, transporting to the recipient, while the most outstanding example of 5PL focuses on E-logistics, Logistics based on e-commerce.

Mastering Demand and Inventory Planning: Essential ...,https://3pllinks.com/mastering-demand-and-inventory-planning/,19 мая 2024 г.,"Have you ever thought about how businesses effectively satisfy customer demand and maintain supplied inventory? Demand and inventory planning is a critical procedure that holds the key to success.

This article contains useful information on how to integrate the operations and sales departments in a demand planning process.

We will discuss the purposes and advantages of this planning as well as the best methods for lowering risks and guaranteeing operational success.

Read also: Logistics in E-Commerce: 5 Logistics Tips for E-Commerce Companies

Importance of demand planning

The goal of demand planning is to forecast the amount of items that will be sold in a specific time frame. The corporation can effectively plan its inventory and production based on this forecast.

Effective planning enables the business to guarantee product availability while avoiding excess inventory, which lowers costs and improves customer service.

Demand planning also gives the business a wider perspective on the industry and rivals, which empowers it to make bolder strategic choices.

Functions of Demand Planning

The first task is demand forecasting, which is estimating how many things will be sold in a specific time frame based on market research and historical data. Decisions about production and inventories are based on this forecast.

Determining the times of peak and low demand for a particular product is another crucial task in the identification of demand patterns. The business may more effectively plan its inventory and production with this information.

Demand planning also serves the purpose of coordinating the operations and sales departments, making sure that decisions about inventory and production are in line with sales projections.

How to do demand planning?

It is necessary to take certain crucial actions in order to execute effective demand planning. Collecting and examining previous sales data while taking patterns and seasonality into account is the first stage. It is feasible to create a forecast that is more accurate with this data.

Gathering market data, including information on competitors, consumer trends, and economic projections, is the second phase. With this knowledge, one may more assertively anticipate demand and comprehend the environment in which the business operates.

Incorporate the sales and operations departments into S&OP (Sales and Operations Planning), a collaborative planning approach, as the third phase. Sales and operations departments collaborate to discuss and coordinate sales, production, and inventory projections during this process.

Lastly, it’s critical to keep an eye on demand and modify plans in light of the outcomes. Demand projections frequently need to be modified over time in response to real market conditions.

How to integrate the operations and sales areas (S&OP)?

Several crucial actions must be taken in order to incorporate the sales and operations departments into an S&OP process.

Establishing an executive team that will be in charge of directing the planning process is the first step. Together with a leader who will oversee the process, this team needs to include members from the departments of finance, operations, and sales. Establishing a meeting calendar for the S&OP process is the second phase. All process areas must be present at these meetings, which must be held regularly (e.g., quarterly or monthly). Establishing production, sales, and inventory projections for the relevant time frame is the third phase. Sales and operations departments should discuss and align these projections during S&OP meetings. The company’s production and inventory capacity are assessed in the fourth step, and any necessary projection revisions are made. It is crucial to keep in mind that demand projections need to be reasonable and account for the company’s inventory and production capability. Lastly, it’s critical to keep an eye on the outcomes and modify the S&OP procedure as needed. Regular monitoring is necessary, and it must consider the outcomes with respect to sales, production, and inventory projections.

How to reduce risks in demand planning?

As we have seen thus far, demand planning may or may not suggest the need for changes in the company’s production and storage capacities. These, however, are internal variables that the business can manage.

But what should happen when the company cannot control changes that take place in the external environment? How do you keep external risks from undermining your planning?

While it is not feasible to totally prevent external risks, there are steps that can be taken to minimize their effects. Several effective techniques that can support this process include:

Monitor the external environment : it’s critical to understand how the market is changing in terms of consumer behavior, rivalry, and the overall state of the economy. Monitoring these variables enables you to spot patterns and foresee shifts in demand.

Monitoring these variables enables you to spot patterns and foresee shifts in demand. Employ the right forecasting models : It’s essential to select a model that fits the demand profile of the organization. Different forecasting techniques, including time series analysis, moving averages, and linear regression, are best suited for different kinds of demand.

Different forecasting techniques, including time series analysis, moving averages, and linear regression, are best suited for different kinds of demand. Communicate and share information: In order to plan for demand, the sales and operations departments must work together and exchange important data. To foresee potential production or delivery issues and to learn about potential changes in demand, it is also critical that the business maintain communication with its suppliers and consumers.

Conclusion

Planning for demand and inventory is necessary to guarantee the effectiveness and prosperity of a business’s operations. Numerous elements must be considered, including the company’s production and logistical capacities, the external environment, and the demand both now and in the future.

Investing in technology and tools appropriate for demand planning, such as inventory management and demand forecasting software, is useful advice for putting the information in this article into practice. These solutions can assure the accuracy of demand projections, expedite decision-making, and automate procedures.

3PL Supply Chain - Invenco,https://www.invenco.net/3pl-supply-chain/,N/A,"The 3PL Supply Chain is at the core of business for all third party logistics companies. It is an overarching connection of the individual 3pl services offered by logistics providers, and its efficiency is the ultimate litmus test of their business capabilities. The purpose of a supply chain is to manage all the individual steps required for successful order fulfilment. In its complete form, a supply chain encompasses all stages of goods manufacturing—including steps such as raw material procurement—all the way to shipment and delivery. The 3PL Supply Chain is a much more condensed process. It commences with the outsourced procurement of (pre-delivered) goods from storage in 3pl warehousing, followed by the packaging and tracked distribution and delivery of the customer order. All reputable 3pl companies constantly work to optimise their 3pl Supply Chain solution and make it unique. By focusing on improving service efficiencies, resources and facilities, and minimising 3pl costs, 3pl providers are ensuring they remain competitive in the eCommerce 3pl industry.

What does a 3PL supply chain mean?

A 3PL Supply Chain is the outsourced management by a third party logistics provider of the core order fulfilment steps required to deliver a product from business to customer. For eCommerce 3pl, the basic steps include: Procurement of goods from 3 rd party warehouse storage as per the customer order. Packaging the order. Coordinating shipment and delivery, including tracking information. Updating the goods inventory to reflect new stock levels. Where relevant, sharing data with the partner business regarding information unique to them, such as product demand, procurement cost per item, delivery time and carrier flexibility. Using a 3PL Supply Chain gives eCommerce business owners the opportunity to redirect the significant personal time and labour previously spent on order fulfilment and manual inventory checks, and instead focus on more important tasks such as business growth strategies and product development. Invenco are specialists at 3pl logistics in Australia. We’re committed to providing the highest quality customer service.

Ways to Work with a 3PL Consultant

Our experience in working with third party logistics providers allows us to service clients in an unparalleled manner, including:



Using a 3PL Consultant to Perform a 3PL Feasibility Study

As 3PL consultants, we have assisted companies in determining the feasibility of outsourcing compared to managing internal fulfillment options. 3PLs can play a vital role in your supply chain management processes - everything from ecommerce fulfillment and pick pack, to manufacturers and distributors shipping to retailers or end customers.

These logistic services can support all of your operations and fulfillment processes, or some portion of your overall needs. But, determining if shifting to a 3PL partner, or continuing with a 3PL relationship is the first step in the process.

Our feasibility analysis and study will help your organization with the following:

Comparison of 3PL costs to internal fulfillment costs, including startup costs and capex requirements for either option.

Objective review and analysis of whether a 3PL option could meet your expectations, service needs, skillsets, and business volumes.

Objective review and analysis of whether your business can run and manage internal fulfillment options. This includes having the right skillsets, infrastructure including systems, etc., and expectations from a capex perspective.

Objective review of the advantages and disadvantages for each option.

An understanding of the timeframes to be up and running and efficient with either option.

Using a 3PL Consultant to Assess the Current 3PL Vendor

For those already utilizing 3PL partners, a major advantage to working with a 3PL consultant, is objectively reviewing and assessing the current 3PL. This 3PL analysis provides feedback as to the quality of service, pricing, support, and flexibility in supporting your business.

This analysis is critical for companies seeking to determine how to proceed with the current 3PL, our analysis will include:

Whether the existing 3PL is suitable for handling the future business. Location of 3PL Warehouses and Fulfillment Centers

An analysis of the current pricing, contracts and service level agreements against industry pricing and expectations.

What should be negotiated in the 3PL pricing, contracts or service level agreements (SLAs) at the next contract renewal.

What changes should be made to improve customer service levels and fulfilling orders to gain efficiency.

What additional support or reporting should be implemented to support improved inventory management.

An objective assessment as to whether the current 3PL is a good partner to your company; do they show a willingness to make improvements; and objective feedback on whether the 3PL wants to retain your business.

This analysis is the basis for making decisions on how to proceed with the current 3PL. For some companies, this means going to market to look for a new 3PL partner, and potentially moving to a new 3PL.

Using a 3PL Consultant to Evaluate and Select a New 3PL Vendor

FCBCO has worked with hundreds of clients and 3PL vendors to evaluate and select the right partner to support their fulfillment needs. As 3PL consultants, we understand the importance of a disciplined, methodical approach to selecting the right 3PL partner.

Once bids are received, we will guide you through the vendor due diligence process. This process will allow you to make a well-informed decision on the best 3PL for your company.

3PL vendor due diligence should involve everything from client reference checks to site visits at the 3PLs facilities. FCBCO will help your team to understand the strengths and weaknesses of each 3PL vendor bidding on your project.

Negotiating the pricing, SLAs and the Statement of Work (SoW) is critical to ensuring that the business is protected against non-performance, or other problems that may arise.

6 Ways to Optimize Your Third-Party Logistics Strategy,https://www.materialogic.com/blog/6-ways-to-optimize-your-third-party-logistics-strategy,N/A,"Order fulfillment is complex, especially when your business is growing quickly or expanding to new retailers. In many cases, eCommerce brands choose to outsource logistics to a third-party provider, known as a 3PL.

3PLs can manage the bulk of an ever-growing order fulfillment workload and increase efficiency across your supply chain.

Whether you're outsourcing for the first time or upgrading to a large-scale vendor, you need to create a solid third-party logistics strategy and ensure your provider is the right fit for your business.

In this post, we'll walk through six ways to strengthen your third-party logistics strategy and match your organizational goals to the right-fit 3PL partner.

Set Clear Goals & Priorities

A goal-oriented action plan gives you and your third-party logistics provider the best chance at success. Rather than choosing a provider to fill a short-term need, start planning with your end game in mind. Think about your primary goals in outsourcing logistics operations. While every eCommerce retailer generally needs to fulfill orders, each business has its own unique KPIs and long-term goals.

Consider whether you need to:

Standardize shipping times

Improve inventory management

Scale your logistics operations quickly

Find more affordable vendors

You may have a single primary goal or a shortlist of ideal business outcomes. No matter how your priorities stack up, be sure to share them with your provider from the start. Having a clear idea of your desired outcome gives your provider clear direction and ensures you’re on the same page every step of the way.

Outline the Scope of Work

Once your 3PL partner knows your end-game, it's time to create an action plan that will take you from where you are today to where you want to be. You'll need to share clearly defined project parameters, upcoming deadlines, budgeting constraints, and other critical business metrics.

Additionally, your partner needs to understand your basic fulfillment requirements, including:

Shipping frequency

Projected order volume

Warehousing needs

Retailer handling requirements

Cutoff times for shipping

Returns management expectations

A 3PL will use both your business goals and these high-level requirements to create a feasible action plan. So, proactive decision-making and cross-team visibility will help ensure your provider can deliver the best possible outcomes during your engagement and beyond.

Define Service-Level Expectations

Your retail partners will typically have rigid requirements around delivery dates, order packing, product tagging, and nearly every other aspect of fulfillment. To ensure you meet these expectations on the backend, establish Service-Level Agreements (SLAs) with your 3PL before kicking off the project.

Implement standards around routine order turnaround –think time cutoffs for same-day or next-day shipping – plus protocols for unexpected order rushes or influxes. Depending on the number of retailers in your portfolio, you may need to establish multiple SLAs to account for varying requirements or guidelines.

Communicate these expectations as early as possible to your 3PL. Be sure to ask about their processes for ensuring an optimal experience in the midst of shifting priorities or last-minute requests.

Assess Key Capabilities

Regardless of your business objectives or handling requirements, your third-party logistics strategy should account for foundational services and capabilities. Develop a list of required features and assess how well your provider can accommodate each.

At a high level, consider:

Space: Your 3PL's fulfillment center must have the physical space to effectively handle your current and projected order volume. However, you should also think beyond square footage and consider your vendor's location and warehouse setup. Is the warehouse centrally located and optimized to deliver across your key markets? Does the actual warehouse space meet your unique product needs, like double-wide aisles or specific racking systems?

Technology: Increased visibility is one of the most significant benefits of outsourcing fulfillment. Discuss your needs and expectations around data insights, inventory visibility, and accessible reporting. Ideally, your 3PL's Warehouse Management System(WMS) will integrate with your existing software tools to provide real-time updates. Your 3PL will also automate internal processes to increase fulfillment accuracy and efficiency.

Transportation: Along with a speedy pick and pack process, your 3PL should maintain accurate shipping and delivery times. Warehouse location plays a role in fulfillment speed, but your 3PL should leverage a vast network of third-party shippers and courier services to enable timely, cost-effective shipping.

Adaptability: 3PL strategy should always tie back to long-term growth goals. That's why you need a fulfillment solution that can scale and adapt with your business. If you're planning to expand to additional retailers or expect demand to double or triple in the next year, you need peace of mind that your logistics partner can keep up. Discuss your plans with your 3PL partner and identify how they'll support your growth.

Prioritize Open Communication

The foundation of a strategic 3PL partnership, effective communication is key to an effective supply chain. Whether you work with a long list of retailers and vendors or a core group of primary partners, you need to set clear communication expectations upfront.

Set standards for how –and how often – you'll communicate with your 3PL. Schedule touchpoints and business reviews in advance to ensure all stakeholders remain on the same page. Beyond identifying a routine email cadence or a reporting schedule, plan for unexpected, time-sensitive requests.

Prepare a list of questions for your prospective partner, such as:

Who is the point of contact? Do I have a dedicated account manager for routine needs and urgent requests?

How quickly can I expect a response from that primary contact?

What is the primary channel or platform for communication?

What is the communication protocol in case of supplier delays, last-minute retailer requests, or customer service concerns?

How will the 3PL team contact me in case of a problem or emergency in the warehouse?

Ideally, your 3PL partner provides visibility into everything from daily warehouse operations to inventory data and performance reports. Learn about the systems they have in place and how you can leverage them to maintain transparency within the partnership. They should walk you through the dashboards and reporting tools you'll use to stay in the loop.

Increased visibility won't just help you stay on track: it gives you a way to hold your 3PL partner accountable and measure their success against retailer scorecards and pre-established KPIs.

Create a Lasting Partnership

While detailed contracts, industry best practices, and innovative technologies drive success for you and your 3PL partner, the key to ongoing growth is a long-term strategic partnership.

Steer clear of the cheapest option or 3PLs that push for one-off projects. Instead, ensure your current or future vendor has your best interests in mind. Your vendor should take the time to align with your business and keep your goals in mind throughout your engagement. They should also offer value-added services, industry guidance, and ongoing strategies that scale with your business.

A genuine, transparent, and lasting 3PL partnership can be the key that opens many doors for your business — now and in the long term.

When sourcing 3PLs, the shipper’s RFP frequently focuses on lane costs rather than strategic elements such as systems integration, real-time visibility, and total-cost performance. The transactional lane-focused relationship is appropriate for companies that require basic lane coverage but do not yet have the maturity to understand total-delivered costs.

For organizations that have progressed beyond the tactical focus on lanes and coverage, a 3PL partner must play a strategic role, going beyond just transporting and storing to identifying problems, implementing solutions, and adding system-wide value.

The 3PL must help the shipper change its management system to better reflect the importance of supply chain in the business. It all starts with the two partners making a decision. The shipper and its third-party logistics partner should reconsider:

What is our primary goal?

What kind of value do we generate?

Are our strategies in sync?

Are we culturally compatible?

Some 3PLs’ primary goal and value proposition is to reduce individual transaction costs and increase lane coverage, whereas others have focused on building robust carrier networks with delivery disciplines, high connectivity levels, and advanced optimization techniques. Some 3PLs have rotating carrier networks with underfunded equipment and undertrained operators, whereas others invest in infrastructure, technology, relationships, and human development over the long term.

Each has a role to play in today’s logistics world and will thrive if the right match is made.

WHY PARTNERSHIPS FAIL

When organizations are strategically or culturally misaligned, the partnership frequently disintegrates due to a reluctance to move forward toward common goals. This usually happens when the two parties rush through the sales and negotiation process, focusing on functional area budgets, only to discover that they are misaligned and stuck with five years of conflict.

Organizations that recognize the importance of aligning on purpose, value, strategy, and culture will avoid the 1980s-style 3PL selection method of identifying three vendors, allowing them to compete, and negotiating tactical deal points.

Instead, they will use an executive-interview method to get to know each other, confirm areas of alignment or misalignment, and wade into a relationship with the expectation that each party leaves knowing about each other’s business and understanding how to maximize value for each other.

The emphasis in the final stages of this type of negotiation is not on shaving 1% off final fees, but on strategic connections that will result in 4x multiples on returns. It consists of the initial changes that organizations must make in order to maximize relationship effectiveness.

A 3PL partner who is aligned on purpose, value, strategy, and culture can provide far more value than a transportation budget variance report.

Avoid commoditized old-school approaches to negotiation and selection, and don’t undervalue the value that can be created with a partner who shares your maturity level.

ProConnect Integrated Logistics – Your Freight Forwarding Partner

A third-party logistics firm can help shippers mitigate a variety of risks throughout the supply chain by outsourcing certain logistics functions.

Abstract: This paper examines the extent to which supply chain outsourcing objectives determine the selection criteria for 3PL service providers. While the 3PL selection criteria are researched earlier, there is little understanding how they are influenced by the strategic objectives of an organisation. Using a cross-sectional survey of 297 logistics and supply chain professionals from across industries in India, structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis reveals that strategic outsourcing objectives are the likely predictor of the 3PL selection criteria. The respondents perceived higher customer satisfaction, reduction of ICT legacy systems, capital investment avoidance and access to state-of-the-art technology that influence the decision on selection of 3PL service provider. The findings provide shipper managers an insight on how to purposefully assess the selection criteria ensuring their alignment with strategic objectives of outsourcing.

Aeva and Plus Showcase Next Generation Design for PlusDrive ...,https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/stocks/AEVA/pressreleases/12967334/aeva-and-plus-showcase-next-generation-design-for-plusdrive-highly-automated-trucking-solution-with-aeries-ii-4d-lidar/,N/A,"Aeva® (NYSE: AEVA), a leader in next-generation sensing and perception systems, and Plus, a global provider of autonomous driving solutions, today announced the unveiling of a design for the next generation PlusDrive highly automated driving solution integrated with Aeva’s Aeries™ II 4D LiDAR™ sensor. The truck will be unveiled in Aeva’s booth at CES 2023 (#6001, LVCC – West Hall).

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230103005221/en/

“Aeva’s 4D LiDAR provides Plus’s state-of-the-art long range perception with valuable instant velocity detection which will help expand the capabilities of our highly automated trucks,” said Tim Daly, Chief Architect and Co-founder of Plus. “We look forward to furthering our partnership with Aeva and demonstrating our latest vehicle design equipped with Aeries II at CES as we ramp up our global deployment of highly automated trucks.”

Aeva and Plus have been collaborating since 2019 to equip and validate Plus’s autonomous trucking solutions with Aeva’s Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) 4D LiDAR. Today’s announcement builds on the partnership that was announced in 2021 where Plus will use Aeva’s 4D LiDAR sensors to augment the long-range perception system in Plus’s automated driving products.

Because heavy duty trucks take much longer to stop than passenger cars, they need to detect safety-critical objects, place them in lanes, and assign an accurate velocity at very long ranges. Aeva’s high performance 4D LiDAR senses precise velocity and position for each point which helps Plus trucks sense their environment clearly at long ranges, shorten response time in safety-critical situations, and address edge cases such as objects that traditional 3D LiDAR and other sensors on the vehicle may miss.

“Today’s announcement is a milestone in our partnership which gives Plus access to the unparalleled performance of our Aeries II 4D LiDAR sensor,” said Mina Rezk, Co-founder and CTO at Aeva. “Plus is deploying safe automated commercial vehicle technology and we are pleased to work with them on the design for their next generation production vehicles.”

Alumni Interview: A Next-Gen Route Optimization Solution,https://www.optiyol.com/alumni-interview-a-next-generation-route-optimization-solution,N/A,"Ozan Gözbaşı and Tuba Yılmaz Gözbaşı graduated from Boğaziçi University Industrial Engineering Department and continued to study in Atlanta, GA for M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Georgia Tech, one of the few engineering and informatics institutions in the world. We talked to Ozan Gözbaşı, who stated that he chose to continue his career as an algorithm engineer in order to contribute to the transformation of academic knowledge into impactful applications on the field, about the entrepreneurship culture in Optiyol and Boğaziçi University.

When was Optiyol founded? How did such a software development idea come about?

Optiyol was founded in 2015. We initially provided services in restructuring the distribution networks of global and local big brands in the FMCG sector. Later, when we received requests from sectors such as logistics, e-commerce and fast consumption for daily dynamic route optimization and observed that the existing solutions did not meet the needs, we decided to develop a new software. With the increase in e-commerce volume and urbanization, supply chains have started to turn direct delivery structure to homes and businesses. Consumers want direct, fast, free and scheduled deliveries; companies are looking for a way to provide a quality service with the least amount of investment in order to remain competitive. While logistics costs are at the level of 5% of the revenue in brick-and-mortar operations, it increases up to 20% in online sales. The distribution network design and route optimization technologies we have developed enable companies to keep costs under control and deliver on time. Compared to their existing planning methods, we enable companies to save 15-25% on fuel and 5-10% on fleet size. ""Hearing the voice of everyone on the field is our most important difference""

What are the differences of Optiyol from existing route optimization software?

When we started this business we were investigating different optimization problems; like many people we were thinking: “Are the route optimization problems not solved yet? Companies should have already automated this process”. However, when we went out to the field, we saw that even in very large companies, this work was done manually and based on experience, and the solutions that were tried with great hopes earlier were thrown out after trying for a while. One of the most important shortcomings was the inability to transfer many real-life constraints and preferences to algorithms, and the lack of a balance between cost savings and applicability.

We can say that the most important differences of Optiyol are that it can transfer field experience to algorithms mathematically and offer realistic plans, customize algorithms according to the preferences of each organization, and update algorithms quickly with the information learned from the field. One important aspaect that our users point out is that our team never gives up in tackling hard problems and is open to feedback from anyone to improve our product further.

What kind of services does your company offer other than route optimization?

In addition to daily operational use in urban and intercity route planning, companies sometimes contact us for optimization of their strategic decisions. Some examples are when they want to restructure their distribution networks, or when they think of starting a new logistics company we help them with realistic simulations and appropriate decision support systems.

What are the future goals of Optiyol?

Our goal is to continue to be the pioneer of this business in our country and to provide an indispensable solution for many distribution organizations of different scales. We also take this as a mission to improve the efficiency of logistics for a country which substantially depends on imports for energy and to minimize logistics footprint in big cities who suffer from heavy traffic. On our path to become a global solution provider we started to get our first users abroad in 2020. We aim to achieve a higher growth in 2021 in U.S. and European markets where large-scale pilot studies are planned. We are at the stage of establishing important strategic partnerships, and we think these partnerships will help us reach a wide market abroad.

You have a PhD from one of the leading universities in the engineering discipline, what advantages does academic knowledge bring you in the world of entrepreneurship? How did you decide not to continue your academic life after your doctorate?

In industrial engineering, Boğaziçi University and Georgia Tech are among the most respected institutions in the world with their research experience and academic personnel. The network and the technical expertise we gained in these institutions help us, as startup founders, to build credibility and assure trust in early customers and investors.

Academic studies mostly have a longer-term impact. I found it a more satisfying experience to work as an ""algorithm engineer"" at a software company where the algorithms get commercialized much faster, touch the real life in a shorter time, and constantly evolve with quick feedback from the people who directly benefit from these solutions.

How were your years at Boğaziçi University? What are the effects of Boğaziçi experience on your entrepreneurship?

I have been at Boğaziçi University between 2000-2005. It was an experience where we both improved ourselves and enjoyed social life with a very intelligent and friendly group of friends. I served on the board of the Operations Research Club, this experience gave us the opportunity to participate and host various events in Europe and Turkey. Quality Summit organizations we organized together with KalDer (Turkish Society for Quality) enabled us to gain early experience in being ""customer oriented"".",next-gen trucking solutions

NGT LINK – High-Speed Intercity Trainset | DLR Transport,https://verkehrsforschung.dlr.de/en/projects/next-generation-train/ngt-link-high-speed-intercity-trainset,N/A,"The DLR develops concepts to show the trends and technologies for future rail vehicles. The main goals of the Next Generation Train (NGT) project are shorter travel times and reductions in specific energy consumption, noise emissions, and wear, while increasing passenger safety and comfort and reducing life cycle costs. To achieve these goals, an operational concept with a family of high-speed trains was developed: The 400 km/h passenger train NGT HGV, using the main high-speed-lines, and the 230 km/h intercity train NGT LINK, to serve passengers from the surroundings.

The NGT LINK Electrical Multiple Unit

NGT LINK’s double-deck layout with full access on both levels

NGT LINK is a seven-car double-deck inter-regional train that connects smaller cities with each other and with the larger cities served by the long-distance train NGT HGV. With its hybrid power system, NGT LINK can run on lines equipped for inductive power transfer, but also on conventionally electrified and partially electrified lines. NGT LINK achieves the goals of the NGT project through a combination of lightweight design, an innovative propulsion system, and a time and energy-efficient operating strategy. Various measures enable a reduction of specific energy consumption of 50 per cent compared to its reference train, the ICE TD, and the passenger-flow optimised layout of the train facilitates short changeover times, ensuring reduced travel times.

NGT LINK’s lightweight car body structure

The design of NGT LINK’s double-deck car bodies enables significant mass reductions through the use of light-weight materials and a force-flow optimised structure. While the ICE TD weighs 216 tonnes, NGT LINK, which is a full 13 metres longer, weighs only 215 tonnes, yet seats 143 per cent more passengers (475 instead of 195).

The topology optimisation of an NGT LINK car body

The innovative mechatronic running gear that NGT LINK uses offers many advantages over conventional bogies. Because every wheel on the train is driven independently, there is no need for an axle within every wheelset. In a similar fashion to NGT HGV, this allows a continuous corridor on both levels of the train, making NGT LINK a full double-decker. Additionally, driving each wheel enables regenerative braking at each wheel, resulting in large energy savings for a train with frequent stops.

The NGT LINK concept shows how trains of the future can be designed in order to offer competitive, economical, and ecological transportation solutions.",next-gen trucking solutions
Autonomous Heavy Truck solutions becoming mainstream,https://highways.today/2021/08/19/autonomous-heavy-truck/,N/A,"Autonomous Heavy Truck solutions becoming mainstream

Research and Markets has released the “Global and China Autonomous Heavy Truck Industry Report, 2020-2021“ which looks at autonomous heavy truck research.

The Report looked at out research into highway scenario-oriented autonomous heavy truck industry, including OEMs and autonomous driving solution providers inside and outside China.

Several autonomous heavy truck companies try to list their shares for financing.

The surging road freight volume and a widening gap in demand for truck drivers, promote the financing boom of self-driving heavy truck industry, and accelerate the R&D of related products and technology landing.

According to incomplete statistics, several autonomous heavy truck solution providers at home and abroad have closed a total of at least 16 funding rounds in the most recent year (August 2020 to August 2021). Examples include PlusAI and Inceptio Technology, two Chinese firms which have raised over USD800 million in all in their recent several funding rounds.

In the meanwhile, some solution providers which suffered sustained losses, and high input and low output, have started resorting to IPO for raising more funds. On April 15, 2021, TuSimple went public on Nasdaq, becoming the world’s first listed company in autonomous driving field. And then a few other autonomous heavy truck solution providers announced listing in the US as special purpose acquisition companies (SPAC).

LiDAR + camera + radar fusion solutions have become mainstream

Most providers adopt the LiDAR + camera + radar fusion solutions combined with HD map and high-precision positioning, which enable their heavy trucks to drive themselves. Some solution providers like Embark use hybrid LiDAR solutions, that is, the combination of solid-state and mechanical LiDARs enables omnidirectional depth perception of the surroundings of a vehicle.

The time that mainstream solution providers inside and outside China are expected to launch the technology is relatively consistent. In the case of loose policies, autonomous heavy trucks will come into service on highways between 2023 and 2024.

Cooperation modes of autonomous heavy truck industry

Quite a few heavy truck OEMs and logistics companies race to land on highway scenarios in addition to capital betting on autonomous heavy trucks.

The highway transportation scenario-oriented autonomous heavy truck ecosystem accommodates autonomous heavy truck solution providers, heavy truck manufacturers and logistics transport service providers, which work together to propel commercialization of autonomous heavy trucks.

As concerns research and development, solution providers and heavy truck manufacturers jointly develop L4 autonomous heavy trucks based on OEM or AM vehicle models. With regard to commercial operation, solution providers partner with logistics transport service providers on commercial operation and actual freight transport test of autonomous heavy trucks.

In terms of partnerships, autonomous heavy truck solution providers often team up with OEMs, co-developing L4 autonomous heavy trucks based on flagship models in OEM or AM market. Foreign autonomous heavy truck companies develop autonomous driving often under the leadership of their group companies, which means sub-brands of these group companies build technological cooperation with solution providers.

For example, Traton under Volkswagen formed a global partnership with TuSimple to jointly develop L4 autonomous driving technology and apply to Volkswagen’s brands like SCANIA and MAN.

Development trends of autonomous heavy trucks

TREND 1

To achieve the goal of “emissions peak in 2030, carbon neutrality in 2060”, the power source of autonomous heavy trucks will shift from diesel to low or zero carbon energy like natural gas and hydrogen.

TREND 2

Platooning technology is being reviewed. In January 2019, Daimler Trucks held a contrary opinion on platooning. After thousands of miles of testing, Daimler has come to the conclusion that truck platooning delivers low economic benefits and has natural defects such as needing a driver, so it will end development of the technology and turn to L4 autonomous heavy trucks. Also, what impacts the actual use of platooning will put on the normal traffic has yet to be verified in real road tests.

In the short run, there will be certain barriers to large-scale commercial use of autonomous heavy trucks in China’s business environment.

The development goal of L4 autonomous heavy trucks is to remove driver and let vehicles complete logistics transport and delivery without needing a human driver to monitor. The most direct customers are logistics companies which operate their own fleets, such as JD, SF Express, YTO Express, STO Express, ZTO Express and YunDa Express. Such companies have much expectation of autonomous heavy trucks lowering their total cost of ownership (TCO), which will make autonomous heavy trucks a big market.

In China, truck drivers are generally self-employed and only 17% of them have their vehicles employed by companies or owned by fleets; 83% drive their own vehicles, according to the Survey Report on Employment of Truck Drivers in 2021 released by China Federation of Logistics & Purchasing (CFLP). The blossom of autonomous heavy trucks in China is still a long way off.

Caterpillar and Luck Stone to scale Autonomous Hauler Truck ...,https://ecoroadsgroup.com/caterpillar-and-luck-stone-to-scale-autonomous-hauler-truck-solutions/,N/A,"Caterpillar and Luck Stone to scale Autonomous Hauler Truck solutions

Caterpillar Inc. announced a collaboration with Luck Stone, the nation’s largest family-owned and operated producer of crushed stone, sand and gravel, to deploy Caterpillar’s autonomous solution to Luck Stone’s Bull Run Plant in Chantilly, Virginia.

This will be Caterpillar’s first autonomous deployment in the aggregates industry and will expand the company’s autonomous truck fleet to include the 100-ton-class (90-tonne-class) Cat® 777.

Looking to accelerate autonomous solutions beyond mining, Caterpillar will implement its existing Cat® MineStar Command for Hauling system at the Bull Run quarry, on a fleet of 777G trucks. This will allow Caterpillar to gain greater insights on quarry operations in order to tailor the next generation of autonomous solutions specific to quarry and aggregate applications.

This project supports the acceleration of autonomous technology for operations with fewer mobile assets to allow a step change in safety and productivity, as currently experienced at large mining operations.

“Luck Stone and Caterpillar’s partnership has been grounded in shared values for many years,” said Charlie Luck, President and CEO of Luck Companies. “Together we believe that safety, innovation and a commitment to people are critical, not only to propelling important projects like this, but to ensuring our focus on the future and all of the exciting possibilities technology affords our industry. Our collaboration will provide opportunities for associates to learn and grow, improve safety and result in production efficiencies. We are thrilled to partner with Caterpillar to achieve this ‘first’ for our industry.”

“Caterpillar has a long-standing relationship with Luck Stone, and we look forward to working together to bring the demonstrated benefits of increased safety and productivity to the quarry industry. We’re excited to get in the dirt and work alongside Luck Stone’s innovative team, so we can learn how to scale our already proven mining solution for another industry,” said Denise Johnson, Caterpillar Group President of Resource Industries.

The current autonomy solutions will be implemented in 2024. This project builds on Caterpillar’s long history in autonomy and automation. Caterpillar is recognized as the industry leader with the world’s largest fleet of autonomous haul trucks, now numbering more than 560 trucks.

These trucks have travelled more than 187 million kilometres and autonomously moved more than 5.1 billion tonnes – most notably – all without a single zero lost-time injury.

Continental and Aurora partner to realize commercially ...,https://www.motorindiaonline.in/continental-and-aurora-partner-to-realize-commercially-scalable-autonomous-trucking-systems/,N/A,"The technology companies Continental and Aurora Innovation, Inc. have entered into an exclusive partnership to deliver the first commercially scalable generation of Aurora’s flagship integrated hardware and software system, the Aurora Driver. The organizations will jointly design, develop, validate, deliver, and service the scalable autonomous system for the trucking industry. The system is expected to be available for carriers and commercial fleet operators across the U.S. and to help reduce costs to facilitate broader adoption. Continental will leverage its decades of experience in systems development for safer, more reliable automotive solutions to industrialize the Aurora Driver and deliver the entire hardware set as well as a new fallback system. In the unlikely event of a failure in the primary autonomy system, the fallback system is designed to ensure a driverless truck can continue the driving task until it reaches a safe position. Additionally, Continental will manage the complete lifecycle of its supplied autonomous hardware kits for the Aurora Driver, from the manufacturing line to decommissioning. The first start of production is expected in 2027, following the expected launch of Aurora Horizon, Aurora’s subscription trucking service underpinned by the Aurora Driver, in 2024.

“At Continental, we are proud to demonstrate our leading technology expertise by being responsible for the development, manufacturing and implementation of the autonomous driving system kits and the fallback path for Aurora’s autonomy system,” said Nikolai Setzer, CEO of Continental. ”In this exclusive partnership, we bundle our systems competence with Aurora’s industry-leading autonomous technology for our common goal to jointly realize the first commercially scalable autonomous trucking systems. A crucial step towards autonomous mobility.”

“Delivering autonomous vehicles at scale has the potential to dramatically transform modern transportation, bringing new accessibility, safety and efficiency to the movement of goods and people,” said Chris Urmson, co-founder and CEO at Aurora. “Continental’s legacy in development and industrialization of automated driving systems, combined with its commitment to transform transportation make it an ideal partner for Aurora. Their depth of expertise will be pivotal to scaling Aurora’s autonomous trucking service, Aurora Horizon.”

Increased safety, reduced fuel consumption and quicker delivery times

Given the continued strain on the global supply chain, autonomous trucking solutions have the potential to help meet today’s growing demand and ease the strain currently experienced worldwide. Autonomously powered trucks have the ability to operate around the clock opening up the possibility for cargo between Dallas and Los Angeles (comparable to Berlin to Madrid) to be delivered within less than 24 hours. As a result, fuel consumption can potentially be reduced by around ten percent, while the delivery time can be shortened up to three times compared to that of a human driver. With more than 1.35 million annual global deaths on roadways according to the World Health Organization, autonomous vehicles represent an opportunity to transform travel safety for millions of individuals and the transportation of millions of goods. Through this joint work, Continental and Aurora are committed to improving safety, delivering scalable and predictable driving capacities via the Aurora Driver, as well as enhancing efficiency with higher utilization.

Autonomous trucking system – the implementation

In this first-of-its-kind partnership, Continental will be responsible for the autonomous driving system kits which will leverage a wide spectrum of Continental’s extensive automotive product portfolio from sensors, automated driving control units (ADCU), high performance computers (HPC), telematics units and more, to the complete fallback system which covers the full chain of effects. Continental will integrate these hardware components into pods which will be supplied to Aurora’s vehicle manufacturing partners. This will advance the product offering for autonomous trucking customers.

Frank Petznick, head of the Autonomous Mobility Business Area, which will implement Continental’s contributions to the partnership with Aurora: “Continental and Aurora will bring the commercial freight market, limited by supply chain constraints in many markets of the world, to a new service level. The first commercially scalable autonomous trucking system provides exciting opportunities for passenger transportation in the coming years and paves the way for broad adoption of autonomous mobility.”

Industry’s first hardware-as-a-service business model

Continental and Aurora have agreed upon a hardware-as-a-service business relationship, based on mileage driven, to deliver safe, reliable, uptime-optimized and commercially scalable autonomous driving systems to customers through the Aurora Horizon platform. Aurora Horizon was developed to offer a safer, more reliable, predictable, and cost-efficient driver service to supplement human driver supply. Using this service, carriers and fleet operators will be able to better utilize the potential of their vehicle fleets, scale business on demand and help address today’s driver shortage.

Continental and Aurora plan to provide this scalable solution to Aurora’s vehicle manufacturing partners. Continental parts are expected to be produced and assembled in its newly built manufacturing facility in New Braunfels, Texas, as well as others across the company’s global footprint.",next-gen trucking solutions

Leinfelden-Echterdingen – Daimler Truck introduces the new TruckCharge brand in Europe. This name brings together all the company’s existing and future offerings relating to e-infrastructure and the charging of electric trucks, i.e. consulting, hardware and digital services. In this way, Daimler Truck intends to provide customers with a cost-efficient overall package, from energy generation through to vehicle operations, enabling them to exploit the full potential of electrification. TruckCharge is targeted not only at truck fleet operators but also at industrial companies with their own or an outsourced truck fleet. As vehicles of different OEMs are generally used, TruckCharge is available irrespective of the truck brand. Daimler Truck will officially launch TruckCharge at the IAA Transportation in Hanover in September.

Karin Rådström, CEO Mercedes-Benz Trucks: “We want to make e-mobility simple and profitable for our customers – also beyond the purchase of electric trucks. With TruckCharge, we are now bundling our range of solutions under one brand and plan to continuously expand the portfolio.”

Improving total costs of fleet operators

The consulting service for fleet operators is part of the comprehensive ecosystem aimed at improving total costs related to electric trucks from Daimler Truck. For some time already, company experts have been providing assistance to vehicle customers in electrifying their fleets and depots. In this context, the focus is on consulting on electric trucks, as well as planning, building, and designing depot charging infrastructure, alongside grid connection. Additionally, Daimler Truck consultants can assist in identifying public funding opportunities for infrastructure and vehicles.

Charging stations for customer depots — digital services

Daimler Truck also offers its customers the possibility to purchase fast-charging stations from its dealerships. The “Depot Charging” package includes consulting, hardware sales and technical service as well as financing solutions from Daimler Truck Financial Services for the charging infrastructure. In addition, qualified Daimler Truck partners will carry out the installation on request. The aim is to ensure smooth charging processes and high levels of vehicle availability. The first pilot projects were launched at various dealerships in Germany at the end of this May, the rollout is currently taking place, with further European countries gradually being added. Alpitronic is the strategic partner for the charging stations.

Digital services comprise operation of the vehicle fleet including intelligent charging management. Suitable payment functions for charging outside of the depot (“public charging”) round off the services offered.

Consulting for electrification of industrial company logistics

Increasing numbers of companies from the industrial sector intend to put carbon-neutral supply chains in place. To this end, Daimler Truck experts have developed a special range of consulting services. This involves evaluating, together with customers, the routes to be electrified in the area of inbound and outbound logistics and, in consultation with the respective fleet operators, drawing up plans on the optimum routes with the corresponding charging points. On this basis, the consultants create customized charging solutions, both for industrial and for transport companies. The first customer for this was Mercedes-Benz Group AG in cooperation with Große-Vehne as the logistics partner.

NextGen,https://natmus.org/nextgen,N/A,"Tucked into the last two surviving factory buildings of the Auburn Automobile Company, Auburn’s National Automotive and Truck Museum — NATMUS, to the local folks — quietly houses one of the country’s most comprehensive displays of automotive and truck heritage. More than 175 vehicles grace the campus, dating from the horse-and-buggy era to 21st century prototypes, many of which are the only specimens of their kind.

Visitors will see the only Chrysler ball-stud hemi engine still in existence, a 1939 GM Futurliner designed to travel the country to offer a glimpse of the future and the art deco hauler Bill Harrah used to transport cars to his Reno museum. Different Chrysler concept cars rotate through the museum every four months, a die cast model display features more than 4,000 vehicles that appeal to toy lovers and a 1950s soda fountain will evoke memories of car hops. NATMUS is truly a hidden gem, but one question remains: who will care for these rich, automotive treasures?

More than 50 volunteers donate their time and talent to NATMUS, meeting weekly to tackle a variety of projects. They focus primarily on maintaining the buildings and bringing vehicles back to life. Restoration efforts encompass everything from sheet metal work to upholstery to mechanical refurbishment — skills that are becoming harder and harder to find. Rather than spending time searching for the right people, NATMUS Executive Director Dave Yarde has decided to train them.

“You don’t have to know anything about cars to start,” says Yarde. “Just come and jump right in. Our more experienced volunteers serve as mentors who teach others.”

Anyone can join the museum’s Wednesday Work Group, which meets from 6 to 8 p.m. each week. There’s no minimum level of experience required; a willing attitude is the only prerequisite. Yarde is hoping to attract more young people who will serve as future leaders for the museum.

“If museums are going to survive, you have to get the next generation involved,” says Yarde.",next-gen trucking solutions

Bridgestone partners with Kodiak to integrate smart tires with self ...,https://www.fleetmaintenance.com/equipment/safety-and-technology/article/21227197/bridgestone-partners-with-kodiak-to-integrate-smart-tires-with-selfdriving-trucks,N/A,"Kodiak self-driving trucks run on Bridgestone tires. Now, Kodiak is running with Bridgestone.

Bridgestone Americas made a minority investment in self-driving trucking company Kodiak Robotics, the two companies announced on June 16. As part of the partnership, Bridgestone will integrate its smart-sensing tire technologies and fleet solutions into Kodiak’s Level 4 autonomous trucks.

“One of the core promises of autonomous trucks is the potential to operate nearly 24/7 at peak safety,” Don Burnette, Kodiak’s co-founder and CEO, told FleetOwner. “Given that goal, it’s incredibly important that we minimize the likelihood of a tire issue and keep our trucks moving. Therefore, it's critical in the development and deployment of our self-driving trucks to be working hand in hand with an industry leader like Bridgestone.”

As they strive for a safer, more efficient, and sustainable future, both companies said they would use the partnership to test future autonomous and smart tire technologies to enhance vehicle intelligence.

“Automated vehicles offer a number of benefits to commercial fleet customers and society, including safer roads with fewer unexpected incidents, and upwards of 20% savings in fuel and efficiency,” said Paolo Ferrari, global chief solutions officer for Bridgestone Corporation and president and CEO of Bridgestone Americas.

Ferrari added that advancements in tire technologies are critical to the future of mobility and sustainability. “This investment will enable Bridgestone and Kodiak to work together to co-develop advanced mobility solutions with speed and precision that will revolutionize commercial trucking,” he said.

Smart tire technologies can collect data and track if weight is evenly distributed among truck and trailer wheels and axles, Burnette explained. “Weight distribution plays a critical role in vehicle dynamics, controllability, maneuverability, and thus safety and vehicle performance,” he said. “Kodiak can also use data collected from the smart-sensing tire technologies to optimize autonomous driving operations to minimize wear and tear on tires.”

Bridgestone can use the data Kodiak collects to better understand the causes of tire breakdown and optimize their tires for the near 24/7 operations that driverless trucks would enable. Burnette added that this data would also improve performance for tires on manually driven tractors.

Bridgestone Americas develops, manufactures, and markets a broad portfolio of original equipment and replacement tires, tire-centric solutions, mobility solutions, and other rubber-associated products. Bridgestone’s suite of cloud-based technologies leverages connected vehicle data to help predict tire health and maintenance, as well as optimize tire lifespan. The company’s vehicle platform technologies also provide tire intelligence to vehicle safety and autonomous systems.

“Additionally, smart tire technology will enable real-time tire monitoring, something that wasn’t previously possible,” Burnette said. “Thanks to Kodiak’s autonomous system, we can use data points from every driving function, like speed, throttle, braking, and acceleration in combination with Bridgestone’s sensors to better understand the impact driving has on tire wear.”

With a safety driver on board, Kodiak currently moves freight autonomously for its customers using its fleet of Level 4 self-driving long-haul trucks in Texas. Since they first started running, Kodiak trucks have used Bridgestone tires. It is planning to remove the safety driver from the cab and offer a truly driverless truck in 2023, Burnette told FleetOwner in May.

Together, Kodiak and Bridgestone will link vehicle-based and smart-sensing tire technologies to improve vehicle safety, fleet efficiency, and the next generation of autonomous trucking solutions.

Burnette noted that trucks cannot operate at peak levels without peak tire performance. “By utilizing Bridgestone’s best-of-breed smart tire technology, including their tire-mounted sensors and tire pressure monitoring systems, we can not only have real-time insights on the performance of our tires but also a deep understanding of how those tires will operate in the future, including being able to predict when breakdowns will occur before they do,” he explained.

Predictive maintenance is a significant piece of the autonomous trucking puzzle that many companies such as Kodiak are attempting to solve. “We are working with Bridgestone on smart sensing tire technologies and predictive maintenance models that will allow us to catch tire issues before they hit the road and maximize vehicle uptime,” Burnette said.

Burnette declined to disclose financial details of Bridgestone’s minority investment. But as part of the partnership, Nizar Trigui, Bridgestone’s CTO and group president of solutions businesses, will join the Kodiak Board of Directors “as an observer,” according to a joint press release.

The Bridgestone deal is just one of the more recent partnerships that Kodiak has secured. The AI company announced a partnership with South Korean conglomerate SK Group in May, which would pave the way for Kodiak to bring its self-driving technology to Asia. In April, Kodiak secured a contract with the Department of Defense to develop autonomous vehicles for Dover Air Force Base. Burnette’s team is also working with Hesai Technology to integrate its LiDAR into Kodiak trucks.

“Bridgestone’s investment is a huge moment for Kodiak and a great validation of our industry-leading autonomous system,” Burnette said.

A Case in Optimizing Intermodal Freight Transportation,https://arxiv.org/html/2405.19255v1,29 мая 2024 г.,"After being implemented, scientific ontologies are typically stored and documented using common semantic web languages that adhere to the semantic web standards, including RDF (Resource Description Framework), OWL (Web Ontology Language), and SPARQL (SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language) (Allemang and Hendler, 2011) . These standards are crucial for structuring, storing, and querying data effectively. They enable the structured representation and interconnected querying of data across diverse systems, facilitating seamless data integration and accessibility on the Semantic Web.

1. RDF serves as a standard model for data interchange on the web, enabling the representation of information in a triple format (subject-predicate-object), facilitating a graph-like structure (Tomaszuk and Hyland-Wood, 2020) .

2. OWL provides additional vocabulary along with formal semantics designed for processing and integrating information as it enables the creation of more complex ontologies (Cardoso and Pinto, 2015) .

3. SPARQL, on the other hand, is used to query databases stored in RDF format. It allows for powerful and expressive queries over diverse data sources, making it essential for extracting and manipulating data within and across knowledge graphs (Curé and Blin, 2014) .

Together, these semantic web languages form the backbone of semantic web applications, allowing for robust and sophisticated handling of scientific resources, such as the sharing of scientific datasets and modes, across the internet. Many smart city applications depend on semantic web technologies to discover and integrate essential data, thereby facilitating informed urban decision-making and optimizations. Consequently, these technologies play a pivotal role in the development of numerous urban decision support systems. Therefore, it is imperative that future AI-powered techniques for generating ontologies also adhere to established Semantic Web Standards. This alignment will ensure compatibility and enhance the effectiveness of data integration across various platforms and systems.",next-gen trucking solutions

Studio Freight showcase the multi-faceted yet 'invisible' ...,https://the-brandidentity.com/project/studio-freight-showcase-the-multi-faceted-yet-invisible-nature-of-ai-in-their-identity-for-brex-ai,1 день назад,"As a trailblazer in financial management solutions, Brex teamed up with Studio Freight to craft a brand identity for their AI-driven product line. Given Brex’s standing as a category forerunner, the Ohio-based creative studio was tasked with the challenge of designing an identity that not only upholds this prestige but also accentuates the seamless amalgamation of AI in their financial ecosystem. All the while, it was crucial to keep the essence of Brex alive in the look. “Working within Brex’s brand system to create a sub-brand for their new AI product was both a challenge and an opportunity,” Creative Director Patrick Torres tells us. “The goal was to develop an identity that honoured and extended the larger brand while also standing on its own two feet as a distinct offering.” At the same time, this AI product marked a huge milestone – so the identity needed to rise to the occasion. The sub-brand was unveiled at an event in San Francisco – featuring speakers from Google, Scale, and Sequoia – where it provided a platform for Brex’s founders and CEO to engage with industry leaders.

In the world of AI-related identities, Torres points out that many take a reductionist approach and draw inspiration from the same sources. “Brex AI’s identity is more of a celebration,” he continues, “where the concept of harmonising human creativity with technological innovation (even in the area of finance) is brought front and centre.” The design philosophy adopted by Studio Freight aimed to set Brex apart in the competitive field of financial technology with a design concept that celebrates this harmony while leaning heavily into ‘tech’ conventions to highlight the next-gen capabilities of the product.

Freight integrated Space Mono into the brand’s typography, reinforcing this tech-oriented feel, and paired it with the brand’s existing typeface, Inter. “Everything in the primary type system is a bespoke cut of Inter or Space Mono,” explains Torres. “However, for this identity, we wanted to take a different approach to the typography. We opted for lighter weights and developed a new type scale that harmonises with, but remains distinct from, the core system. This allowed us to maintain a cohesive look while giving the AI identity its own unique presence within the Brex brand.”

The central symbol for the product was designed to reflect the nature of AI, which operates invisibly in the background. Studio Freight built upon the original logomark – an undulating rectangle – layering it and adding motion, creating a sense of depth and movement to represent the underlying mechanics of AI, such as its ability to make accurate associations in complex data sets. “This approach allowed us to maintain the familiarity of their core identity while introducing a new reality, which is that Brex can go much deeper with AI,” says Torres.

These layers are mirrored throughout the visual language, such as in translucent 3D renders reminiscent of unfolding flowers. According to Torres, these convey a sense of ‘flow,’ while the lighting, overlays, and effects create some drama and magic. “All assets including 3D were custom-made, giving us precise control over dark mode assets for digital use and light mode assets for real-life events,” he notes.

A series of simplified illustrations are also introduced to depict abstract concepts in spend management, resonating with both technical and non-technical audiences and narrating the journey of problem-solving and solution implementation.

The identity introduces a vibrant blue hue as the sub-brand’s leading colour, balancing perfectly with Brex’s signature orange. As an energising pairing, this not only injects vitality into the branding, but is also adaptable to applications where ‘dark’ and ‘light’ modes are needed.

Working 4 You: CareLink addresses transportation service ...,https://www.kark.com/news/working4you/working-4-you-carelink-addresses-transportation-service-issues/,14 часов назад,"LITTLE ROCK, Ark – A local nonprofit that provides transportation for seniors has run into problems being able to book rides.

It’s a ride to the doctor’s office that one man says he needed but had to cancel when he couldn’t schedule a transportation pick-up.

As people drive around Little Rock, 72-year-old Fred Williamson says he doesn’t have that option.

“I gave up driving in 2016 on account of my eyes,” Williamson said.

Williamson says he is legally blind, has no car, no kids and no family members who could be a constant help.

“We don’t have any way to get to the doctors and stuff like that,” he said.

He also says he turned to get help from the nonprofit CareLink, which provides seniors across central Arkansas a variety of services like transportation.

“I usually use it no more than 2-3 times a month when I did use it,” Williamson said.

But in recent months, Williamson says there’s been an ongoing problem.

“They said no booking available. I gave up at that time and I canceled my appointment. I’m a diabetic number 2,” Williamson goes on to say, “I need these doctor’s appointments.”

Michelle Gilbert, Vice President of Development for CareLink says demand is growing but there’s a big issue they’re seeing.

“In January of 2021 to offer a full-service transportation program we were really excited to do that but unfortunately the funding that is available is insufficient to meet the great need,” Gilbert said.

Gilbert says state and federal funding made the transportation program possible but with some funding ending or stagnant, their service is decreasing.

“We would be happy to do an infinite number of trips for the seniors in our community if the funding was available,” Gilbert said.

The solution Gilbert says is for them to get more funding but that’s not easy. Williamson says he feels stuck.

Gilbert says they provided close to 60,000 trips last year but will have to connect some callers to other agencies this year.

Williamson says he will keep on trying and lean on who he can.

“I hope the future improves, I hope I make some appointments,” Williamson said.

Gilbert says they hope for more funding to help ensure the future of the transportation program.",next-gen trucking solutions

"Germany Ranks Second In Global EV Production, Leading ...",https://emobilityplus.com/2024/06/12/germany-ranks-second-in-global-ev-production-leading-europes-clean-mobility-transition/,1 день назад,"In 2023, Germany produced approximately 1.27 million purely electric (BEV) and hybrid (PHEV) vehicles, making it the second largest manufacturer of electric vehicles globally, following China. While China dominates global EV production with most of its vehicles sold domestically, Germany distinguishes itself with 76 percent of its EVs exported to international markets.

The United States holds the position of the world’s third-largest EV producer. Within Europe, Germany leads significantly, producing more electric vehicles than Spain (256,000) and France (225,000) combined.

“Germany is leading the way in Europe’s transition to clean mobility, producing nearly a million purely electric vehicles last year,” said Stefan Di Bitonto, automotive expert at Germany Trade & Invest. “Almost 800,000 people in Germany work in the automobile industry, creating the mobility of the future. Germany is also the global leader in innovation in electric propulsion, with one-third of patents in this area originating from Germany.”

Germany Trade & Invest, the government agency responsible for promoting international business and supporting German companies abroad, highlighted the country’s role in advancing electric vehicle technology and fostering sustainable transportation solutions.

Germany’s robust EV production reflects its commitment to clean mobility and innovation. The significant export rate of German EVs showcases the country’s influence in the global automotive market, positioning it as a key player in the transition to environmentally friendly transportation.

As Germany continues to push the boundaries of electric vehicle technology and production, its leadership in Europe and substantial contributions to the global EV market underscore its dedication to sustainability and technological advancement.

We just broke ground on America's first next-gen nuclear ...,https://www.gatesnotes.com/Wyoming-TerraPower-groundbreaking,3 дня назад,"Today is a big one for Kemmerer—for the coal plant workers who will be able to see their future job site being constructed across the highway, for the local construction workers who will be part of a 1,600-person skilled labor force building the plant, and for the local businesses that will take care of the new workforce.

The plant was designed by TerraPower, a company I started in 2008. But my nuclear journey started several years earlier, when I first read a scientific paper for a new type of nuclear power plant.

The design was far safer than any existing plant, with the temperatures held under control by the laws of physics instead of human operators who can make mistakes. It would have a shorter construction timeline and be cheaper to operate. And it would be reliable, providing dependable power throughout the day and night. As I looked at the plans for this new reactor, I saw how rethinking nuclear power could overcome the barriers that had hindered it—and revolutionize how we generate power in the U.S. and around the world.

So, we started TerraPower, where nuclear scientists could take the concept and transform it into a reality. Since then, the amazing team at TerraPower has proven we can do nuclear better. They are leading the country—and the world—in developing safe, next-generation nuclear technology.

But that technology was just an idea in a lab and on a computer screen until today.

You can read more about the super cool science behind the Natrium plant here. Now that we’ve broken ground, the first order of business is to build the sodium test facility, which will test components and transfer the liquid sodium that will be used to cool the nuclear reactor. Construction will continue over the years ahead before the plant hopefully comes online in 2030.

For a project this big and this important to work, it takes private companies partnering with public leaders and governments. I can’t say enough good things about Mayor Bill Thek, Mayor Mark Langley, and the remarkable communities here in Kemmerer and Diamondville, who have embraced this project.

Today couldn’t have happened without the Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program, which is supporting the project with the largest single contribution the federal government has ever committed to a private project. If we’re going to solve climate change, it’s going to take courage, commitment, and partnership between the federal government and private industry, a point that Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm has made repeatedly. Gov. Mark Gordon and Senators John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis have been true champions, and we’re grateful for the support from TerraPower’s investors and development partners, including Bechtel, GE Hitachi, PacifiCorp, and Berkshire Hathaway.

What’s next? The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission accepted TerraPower’s construction permit application for review last month. It’s a step that sounds bureaucratic but is, in fact, a huge deal and the first time something like this has happened with a commercial non-light water reactor in more than 40 years. This step starts the review process at the NRC for the permit application—once it is approved, construction can begin on the actual nuclear reactor.

The review process will take a couple of years, so in the meantime, TerraPower will continue to build the non-nuclear parts of the facility. Construction will begin next year on the so-called “energy island,” which is where the steam turbines and other machinery that actually generate power will sit. (The reactor will eventually be part of a “nuclear island,” and the team hopes to start building that in 2026.)

While these first-of-a-kind projects can be big and risky, they are too important for our future to fail to act. I’m proud of all those who have helped ensure the most advanced nuclear project in the world gets built right here in the United States.

I believe that the next-generation nuclear power plant that TerraPower is building here will power the future of our nation—and the world. Everything we do runs on electricity: buildings, technology, and increasingly transportation. To meet our economic and climate goals, we need more abundant clean energy, not less. The ground we broke in Kemmerer will soon be the bedrock of America’s energy future. Today, we took the biggest step yet toward safe, abundant, zero-carbon energy.",next-gen trucking solutions

10 Cutting-Edge IoT Use Cases for 2023,https://www.iotsworldcongress.com/10-cutting-edge-iot-use-cases-for-2023/,N/A,"Back to THE INDUSTRY NEWS

There are more than 10 billion IoT devices worldwide, and this number is projected to reach about 30 billion by 2030. Connectivity has countless applications for consumers and businesses alike. New technology enables manufacturers to make these devices smaller, more efficient, more powerful, and more versatile.

Whether a business adds connectivity to old equipment or builds a new solution from scratch, the Internet of Things (IoT) brings advanced capabilities to a wide range of processes. Broadly speaking, connecting physical devices to a network enables end users to remotely monitor, analyze, control, and automate their operations. But what that actually looks like depends on the device and its underlying technology.

Here are 10 examples of how IoT transforms the way we work and live.

1. Fleet management

Even with just a handful of vehicles to coordinate in a small geographic area, businesses must know precisely where they’re located and how they’re being used to optimize routes and save on fuel costs. A local house cleaning company may need to know which van is closest to which job site to coordinate new service requests. Or a national courier service may need to schedule service at the nearest shop for a truck that just popped a fault code. GPS trackers, some of which connect to a vehicle’s OBD II ports, can give fleet managers real-time visibility into their equipment’s location, speed, fuel usage, and more.

Fleet management IoT use case

Inquest Wireless uses IoT connectivity to help car dealerships and financial institutions track down vehicles due for repossession.

2. Micromobility

A growing number of micromobility services have made rentable bikes, scooters, and other personal transportation vehicles available in cities around the world. These services rely on cellular IoT connectivity to ensure the pool of vehicles can be recovered and reused and that customers can be billed appropriately (and automatically) for each ride.

Micromobility IoT use case

Ryde, a leading e-scooter service in Norway, uses an IoT unit in each of their 20,000 scooters to activate and deactivate the device.

3. EV charging

Eager to reduce carbon emissions, governments like the US and EU are heavily investing in EV infrastructure. As consumers and businesses embrace electric vehicles, EV charging businesses are working to establish enough charging stations to keep them running. These distributed self-service units are often in parking garages, other covered areas, or remote locations. They need IoT connectivity to facilitate transactions, monitor power usage, and remotely perform diagnostics.

4. Building monitoring

Building automation is an increasingly common use case for IoT. Facility managers want to keep operating costs low, and IoT sensors allow them to remotely monitor who’s in the building and equipment and resource use. Smart buildings enable them to configure the HVAC system, lighting, and other infrastructure to react as people come and go automatically. This keeps employees comfortable, preventing wasteful power consumption and reducing reliance on manual adjustments.

5. Environmental monitoring

Traditionally, environmental monitoring has involved a significant amount of manual data collection as experts examine changes in soil, water, air, and other conditions. Monitoring this data over time gives governments, businesses, and organizations better insights into how various processes impact the environment so they can make more informed decisions. Using IoT, stakeholders can collect, organize, and analyze this data remotely, reducing their reliance on expensive on-site visits.

Environmental monitoring IoT use case

In-Situ connects telemetry devices to a data services platform that enables customers to monitor water conditions remotely.

6. Predictive maintenance

Every year, unplanned downtime costs manufacturers billions of dollars globally. Equipment breaking could force them to halt operations—for hours or even days—until they can get the parts and services they need. Failures can also cause serious injury or death, leading to lawsuits and significant fines. Predictive maintenance systems leverage connected sensors and machine learning to predict when a machine is likely to fail. Businesses can schedule services and order parts before there’s a problem. The sensors detect changes in conditions like temperature, output, pressure, vibration, or sound and use the asset’s maintenance history to connect these changes to previous failure patterns.

7. Smart farming

Agricultural operations tend to have razor-thin margins. But using advanced IoT-powered tech, farmers around the world are discovering opportunities to increase crop yields, manage livestock, reduce waste and losses, and maximize efficiency. In some cases, IoT is improving operations by automating manual processes—like irrigation and cow milking. In others, it’s giving farmers the visibility they need to optimize their resources and equipment.

Smartisland, for example, lets farmers monitor their crops, empowering them to optimize resource consumption and prevent diseases.

8. Medical IoT

Medical equipment constantly collects data, which providers, caretakers, and patients rely on to make informed healthcare decisions. Depending on the equipment and the patient, conditions can change quickly. A fast response can make the difference between life and death. Medical IoT enables providers to monitor patients remotely, receive alerts when conditions become dangerous, and collect and analyze data more efficiently.

9. Smart metering

In the past, utility providers had to manually visit each customer and check each utility meter to analyze resource consumption and bill customers correctly. Modern providers use smart metering to connect physical meters to a digital application, allowing them to remotely collect utility data in real time. This helps them allocate infrastructure, automate billing, and give their customers better insight into their resource consumption.

10. Smart security

Over the last few years, consumers and businesses have seen a surge of demand for smart security cameras. Footage from retail security systems regularly floods social media. This access to remote video monitoring is made possible by IoT. Whether the cameras are always on or motion activated, connectivity enables them to send alerts to an end user via text, email, or mobile app. From there, they can access the footage on demand.

Lab Equipment Shipping,https://moveit.com/industries/lab-equipment/,N/A,"Lab Equipment Shipping

Solutions for Lab Equipment Shipping

Shipping lab and biopharmaceutical equipment isn't an easy task. From fragile glass items to hazardous material, lab shipments require careful planning and unique safety methods to ensure that the journey is accident-free. MoveIt® Specialized Logistics and MoveIt® Freight Solutions have spent years researching and perfecting lab equipment shipping services, be it regionally or internationally. From around the corner to around the world, you can trust the experts at the MoveIt® Companies.

How Does It Work?

When shipping sensitive lab equipment, thereâs nothing more important than ensuring it arrives in one piece. Whether youâre transporting analytical instruments or large, heavy equipment, it requires great care to keep these items safe. An additional challenge is added when the shipment necessitates a timely delivery!

At MoveIt®, we use cutting-edge transportation techniques to ensure that each shipment of lab equipment arrives on time and intact. Our teams are trained to handle items that require extreme caution or care. We often use a combination of air ride, blanket wrap shipping, climate-controlled vehicles, and white glove service for fragile, high-quality material or expensive lab equipment. Rather than simply offering a shipping service, we design a custom strategy built around your unique needs.

International Shipping

If you need to transport your lab equipment across international borders, then itâs all the more important that you find a logistics company with a strong background in international shipping. Any small mistake on paperwork could lead to headaches and additional fees down the road. Proper packaging is also important, given that the longer the transit and the more hands it sees, the more likely your equipment is to be damaged.

Why Risk Management?

We study the risks so we can meet your needs. Large freezers and cumbersome observation equipment can't be shipped by most ground shipping companies because they're ill-equipped or unfamiliar with the moving requirements. MoveIt® ground freight shipping, however, has years of proven service in the shipment of lab equipment, which allows customers to rest easy knowing that their shipment is in good hands.

MoveIt® Shipping Insurance

Worried about shipping insurance? Weâve got you covered. Since 1979, weâve focused on taking a proactive approach to reduce shipping claims. We match suitable modes of transportation and packaging with the value and disposition of items being shipped. Because of this, we have one of the lowest claims incident ratios in the industry!

For the last 25 years, MoveIt has had the same agent and the same insurance policy with Chubb GroupÂ®. It covers both new and used goods. In an industry where coverage is often cancelled, this relationship has endured because of our diligence in reducing claims and keeping premium costs in line for customers.

We Can Handle It All

At MoveIt®, we strive to be experts in the shipment of lab and biopharmaceutical equipment. Our ability to provide packaging, emergency and blanket wrap shipping to our clientele allows us to manage shipments from start to finish, leaving little room for error. We label every box with painstaking detail so all items are efficiently delivered and properly handled when unpacked. Nothing should be left to chance when shipping valuable lab equipment, and we're there to make sure things run smoothly.

What Is Amazon's Last Mile Delivery? What Kind Do They ...,https://www.ponyex.com/blog/what-is-amazons-last-mile-delivery/,N/A,"Companies like Amazon use last mile delivery services to ensure their products get to customers on time—but what is Amazon’s last mile delivery process? While major shipping companies and retailers often contract with third-party last mile delivery services, Amazon has created their own.

Over the past two years, the demand for Amazon delivery has grown exponentially. Thanks to the COVID-19 pandemic, more people than ever started shopping online—and many of them are still shopping online with greater frequency than they used to. From household items to groceries, here’s an overview of Amazon’s last mile delivery services.

Why do companies use last mile delivery?

“Last mile” is a bit of a misnomer. A last mile delivery service isn’t limited by a mile radius. It’s simply a logistics term to describe the last leg of any delivery’s journey. Companies ship packages to a local transportation hub. When the package arrives at the hub, a last mile carrier—whether third-party or in-house—picks up the delivery and takes it to its final destination.

One of the biggest reasons to deliver through last mile carriers is customer service. Consumers are now used to free, fast shipping on everything from same-day grocery orders to major appliances. Because the volume of online purchases has skyrocketed, last mile delivery services enable efficient transportation and delivery.

In turn, this builds customer loyalty, helps keep shipping costs down and builds a better reputation for the company.

What kind of last mile delivery does Amazon use?

While many retailers and shipping companies use third-party last mile delivery services, Amazon has created their own. In 2019, the company spent $35 billion on shipping costs—$10 billion in the holiday quarter alone. Clearly, Amazon has a vested interest in keeping cost down, delivering packages quickly and standing out among competitors.

Here are some of the innovative last mile services Amazon has introduced or is trying:

Prime Air: Plans for a drone delivery service made the news several years ago. Prime Air has the FAA’s blessing to research and develop delivery drones—your future Amazon orders might just come from the sky. This may be a way off, however: TechTarget reports that “Amazon officials… said their goal for Prime Air drones would be to fly above 200 ft and below 500 ft. The company said its drones would carry packages weighing up to 55 lbs and travel within a radius of 10 miles from its distribution centers.” The program has been in development since 2015, and so far, drone delivery is not widely available, if at all.

Delivery service partner programs: In an effort to expand their last mile delivery service, Amazon invested in their delivery service partner (DSP) programs. The company works with small, independent owners to create a DSP. Owners invest $10,000 and assemble a team, while Amazon offers the technology and the package volume to get their business going. This is beneficial to Amazon, since they’ll have affordable last mile services at their fingertips.

Robotic deliveries: Unmanned robotic delivery vehicles are becoming more popular these days, and Amazon has its fingers in that pie, too. Amazon Scout is the company’s robot delivery service. So far, the service has only been tested in Washington state.

Unmanned robotic delivery vehicles are becoming more popular these days, and Amazon has its fingers in that pie, too. Amazon Scout is the company’s robot delivery service. So far, the service has only been tested in Washington state. Amazon Fresh: While Amazon and Whole Foods have partnered for grocery delivery in recent years, the company went a bit further and established Amazon Fresh. Amazon Fresh offers free, same-day grocery delivery to Prime customers for orders over $35. The company uses their last mile delivery service to take groceries from the local warehouse to the customer’s home.

These innovations allow Amazon to stay on the cutting edge of last mile delivery. According to TechTarget, “One advantage Amazon holds over both Target and Walmart is that it can draw on capital from its other businesses, most notably its AWS cloud services where profit margins are significantly higher than those from its other e-commerce businesses.” The company has more money to invest in delivery service and innovation, so it can stay ahead of other major online retailers.

When it comes to last mile services, having that extra capital is crucial. For instance, grocery delivery with last mile service is expensive. The last mile service alone makes up 41 percent of the total shipping costs. Amazon’s investment in their own last mile delivery is bound to help keep costs down, and customers coming back.

Now you have the answer to the question, “What is Amazon’s last mile delivery?”—and can look forward to new delivery innovations from the ecommerce giant.",cutting-edge parcel delivery startups

Samsung unveils plan to speed up delivery of AI chips,https://www.cnn.com/2024/06/12/tech/south-korea-samsung-ai-chips-plan-intl-hnk/index.html,14 часов назад,"Seoul/San Jose Reuters —

Samsung Electronics said its contract manufacturing business plans to offer a one-stop shop for clients to get their artificial intelligence (AI) chips made faster — integrating its global No 1 memory chip, foundry, and chip packaging services, to harness the AI boom.

With clients working with a single channel of communication that directs Samsung’s memory chip, foundry and chip packaging teams at once, the time it takes to produce AI chips, usually weeks, has been cut by around 20%, Samsung said on Wednesday.

“We are truly living in the age of AI, the emergence of generative AI is completely changing the technology landscape,” said Siyoung Choi, president and general manager of the foundry business, at a Samsung event in San Jose, California.

Samsung expects global chip industry revenue to grow to $778 billion by 2028, boosted by AI chips, Choi said.

At a briefing with reporters ahead of the event, Executive Vice President of Foundry Sales and Marketing Marco Chisari said the company believes OpenAI CEO Sam Altman’s loose projections on soaring demand for AI chips are realistic.

Altman has told executives at contract chipmaker TSMC that he wanted to build roughly three dozen new chip factories, Reuters has previously reported.

Samsung is one of the few companies that sells memory chips, offers foundry services and designs chips under the same roof. That combination has often worked against it in the past, as some clients were nervous that doing business with its foundry might benefit Samsung as a competitor in another field.

However, with skyrocketing demand for AI chips and the need for all the chip parts to be highly integrated to train or infer huge amounts of data fast by using less power, Samsung believes its turnkey approach will be a strength going forward.

The South Korean tech giant also touted its cutting-edge chip architecture known as gate all-around (GAA), a type of transistor architecture that helps improve chip performance and reduces power consumption.

GAA is seen as important to keep making more powerful chips for AI as chips become finer to the point of pushing the boundaries of physics.

Although competitors such as global foundry No 1 TSMC are also working on chips using GAA, Samsung started applying GAA earlier, and said it plans to mass produce its second-generation 3-nanometer chips using GAA in the second half of this year.

Samsung also announced its latest 2-nanometer chipmaking process for high-performance computing chips, which places power rails on the backside of the wafer to improve power delivery. Mass production is slated for 2027.",cutting-edge parcel delivery startups

Cutting Edge Firewood the Original Atlanta ...,https://www.cuttingedgefirewood.com/pages/about,N/A,"Who We Are

At Cutting Edge, we make great fires. But more than that, we’re passionate about them. Consider all the moments where a great fire is essential: gathering with friends, fighting off the winter chill, cooking the perfect pizza, enjoying a strong beverage with an old friend, taking a quiet moment of solitude.

Truly, a great fire makes a difference. But as Cutting Edge founder Leroy Hite discovered years ago, great firewood, smoking wood, and pizza wood is hard to find.

Growing up in a small rural suburb in northwest Georgia, Leroy understood firewood and hard work from an early age. When he wasn’t tending to the family garden he was helping maintain the acre of land that they lived on, doing myriad chores and managing the woodpile.

Fast forward to adulthood, and Leroy was frustrated. As much as he loved great fires, he couldn’t seem to find the right fuel for them. He’d looked all over, too, visiting grocery and hardware stores, only to come home with a small bag of sub par wood. He’d call the guy down the street, who would dump a load of dirty, moldy wood from his backyard into Leroy’s driveway where he had to stack and carry it himself. He’d wander around his backyard looking for sticks that had fallen and dried up enough to burn. But none of these options produced great fires or great fireside experiences.

New Cargo Shipping App by Continuus Tech on Snowflake ...,https://www.martechcube.com/new-cargo-shipping-app-by-continuus-tech-on-snowflake-marketplace/,23 часа назад,"Joint customers can now predict exposure of global cargo shipping and sector supply chain and network exposure with Continuus Cargo Shipping App.

Continuus Technologies announced at Snowflake’s annual user conference, Snowflake Data Cloud Summit 2024, that it has launched the Continuus Cargo Shipping Container App using Factset Shipping and RBICS Datafeed on Snowflake Marketplace. Availability on Snowflake Marketplace will enable joint customers to respond and adjust exposure to potential supply chain issues surrounding shipments into United States ports.

“In today’s world, you cannot read the news without seeing a headline about shipping and supply chain risk,” explains Matt Moeser, Founder and CEO of Continuus Technologies. “Using cutting edge LLMs easily available in Snowflake Cortex, Continuus normalized free descriptive text from cargo shipping manifests to sector and industry codes. Building the link between the text data and normalized sector and industry codes would be extremely challenging without this technology. Continuus is excited to deliver this in an easy-to-use Streamlit app from our Native App Studio team. ”

Continuus and Snowflake, the AI Data Cloud company, are working together to help joint customers streamline operations, inform business decisions and drive innovations by creating compelling views tracking maritime shipping transactions from bills of lading. Shipping transaction descriptions are then mapped to industry networks using Snowflake’s AI features and linked to shippers and consignees to allow firms to easily identify shipping risks and exposures.

“Continuus’s Cargo Shipping Container App highlights the transformative power of data in today’s complex business landscape. By utilizing Snowflake Cortex, Continuus has streamlined the process of normalizing and analyzing cargo shipping data, providing joint customers with actionable insights to mitigate supply chain risks,” said Kieran Kennedy, Snowflake’s Head of Marketplace. “This partnership exemplifies our shared commitment to empowering businesses with the tools they need to make better-informed decisions and drive innovation.”

From regional views to specific ports, the Continuus Cargo Shipping App enables users to discover granular details about the contents and potential sector impacts. Joint customers can now leverage the Continuus Cargo Shipping App on Snowflake Marketplace, allowing them to get a running start on their data analysis with a flexible view and mapping of descriptive shipping manifest data.

“FactSet’s Maritime Shipping and industry leading RBICS industry classification data come together in the Continuus Cargo Shipping App to answer a very topical and complex risk question,” said Rob Long, Director at FactSet. “We’re excited to partner with Continuus to enable users to better understand the complexities of Cargo Shipping and help users approach sector exposure.”

Snowflake Marketplace is powered by Snowflake’s ground-breaking cross-cloud technology, Snowgrid, allowing companies direct access to raw data products and the ability to leverage data, services, and applications quickly, securely, and cost-effectively. Snowflake Marketplace simplifies discovery, access, and the commercialization of data products, enabling companies to unlock entirely new revenue streams and extended insights across the AI Data Cloud.

Transportation Management Software vs Freight ...,https://freightcontroller.com.au/transportation-management-software-vs-freight-management-software/,N/A,"At Freight Controller we’re discussing supply chain software systems with our customers all the time. And we’ve noticed that some people will say they are looking for a Transportation Management Software (TMS) System and others say they are looking for a Freight Management Software (FMS system), but they are essentially referring to the same thing. So, whilst there is definite overlap in functionality between these supply chain systems, (depending on the ways that different vendors have built up their systems over time), we thought we’d write a short article on the differences between them.

Freight Management Software System

A Freight Management Software system typically is used for managing your third-party carriers; your outsourced freight suppliers. As this implies it offers a centralised system for managing multiple carriers, hence it is often also referred to as a ‘multi-carrier’ system.

To earn the ‘M’ for Management in FMS means the system is more than a mere freight or dispatch system. They usually offer central quoting for least cost carrier selection of all your carriers and central tracking of said carriers’ shipments. Also, some form of basic reconciliation of carrier invoices against the historic freight data is offered within the system, along with other centralised freight reporting.

An FMS system becomes crucial if you have more than one carrier, as juggling between carrier systems to get quotes and to track lost / late freight becomes time consuming, plus you can’t merge data from all of your carriers for reporting purposes. It can also be helpful with just one carrier if you have a need to integrate with other systems, e.g., ERP or WMS, as if you ever have to re-integrate because you want to change carriers that is time consuming and costly, presenting a hurdle to overcome.

Transportation Management Software System

A Transportation Management Software system includes your own employee and subcontracted drivers as well as third-party carriers. Often an FMS system will also offer functionality for this type of transport work as well so it can be confusing. Where the difference, (and we’re talking about the Australian market here), really lies is with capabilities for assisting with loading and routing optimisation of your own ‘internal’ vehicles.

An FMS system may have some basic capabilities for organising Run Sheets and assigning consignments to different internal drivers and some, (like ours) will also have mobile Sign-on-Glass with delivery options e.g., ATL, split deliveries, photo required, etc., etc. So, again there is a blurring of capabilities with these systems, but larger transport and some 3PL companies are best off with a TMS for the extra capabilities.

If you are looking for a freight system to integrate with your ECommerce system that has Inventory Management capabilities, then most likely a cloud based TMS system will be where you need to focus your research. These systems will usually manage your Inbound Freight as well, which usually distinguishes it from a typical FMS system, which focusses on outbound.

A sophisticated TMS may also assist with pick and pack; wave orders; and even optimising freight packaging. They tend to integrate with an online shopping website via APIs to streamline the online shopping process for shippers’ customers.

Saas and Portal Aggregators

SaaS – Software as a Service – refers to a system that shippers can log on to in order to access a service. In this article we are focussing on the transport / freight services, and as such it typically comes preloaded with carrier rates from the Freight Forwarding or Broker vendor. Some are hybrid systems where you can BYO your own rates alongside rates supplied by the vendor of the system. In that way you can compare and select on a consignment level basis the best carrier for your needs either economically or based on ETD – Estimated Times for Delivery.

A Portal Aggregator is similar but usually just housing the supplier’s rates and they can be quite slow to load consignments and print labels as they are browser-based and may have low tech hardware capabilities for printing. This is fine for low volume users who cannot command competitive rates and do not need to prioritise speed for processing their sales orders into shipping orders.

These systems are typically used by small ECommerce / Retail businesses and for office shipments of documents and small parcels. However, if a business is aiming to scale their business, they might be better suited to a TMS with ECommerce and some Inventory Management capabilities.

Conclusion

As you can see there’s a certain amount of crossover between the various systems that assist businesses with managing their freight. A business looking to implement such a system to automate and control their processes needs to carefully research their requirements to get a good match to their current and future needs.

Freight Controller has the expertise to assist with this review process and our software systems have wide-ranging capabilities to meet the needs of ECommerce, Retail, Office, 3PL and Manufacturing, Wholesale & Distribution organisations, so please feel free to set up a meeting to tap into our knowledge in this area when scoping out your RFP requirements for automating your distribution systems.",cargo management technology
Cargo - crane aero,https://crane.aero/solutions-services/cargo,N/A,"Cargo Overview

Is the Air Cargo Industry ready for a transformation? The rules are changing; technological advancements allow the industry to move towards a customer-centric model. Logistics companies are facing an era of unprecedented breakthroughs as digitalization becomes inevitable. Air cargo players are no longer satisfied with the current conditions, as their needs and expectations have changed. Clients expect a faster, more flexible and transparent service for their goods. Rapidly evolving industries have forced the air cargo business to become more agile and provide innovative solutions and services. With Crane Cargo solutions, Hitit can be an invisible partner and guide companies through this transition.

The cargo business model and business cycle are very different and distinct from the passenger model, even though they often use the same aircraft. Transporting cargo by air is information intensive. A lot of data is exchanged between many members of a complex supply chain, however the industry still relies heavily on paper to transfer that information. Smart IT solutions are the key nowadays to ensuring the efficiency of logistic chains and data quality. Hitit’s Crane Cargo solutions are built to address the challenges of the modern Cargo industry. A turn-key web-based solution offers a distinctly unique, fully integrated modular platform with complete end-to-end control over commercial, operational and revenue accounting capabilities.

Crane Cargo solutions are highly interoperable, secure, scalable and user-friendly. The modular design of the system makes it possible to start with core modules and add as needed. Hitit’s Cargo Management Systems covers all aspects of air cargo transportation from acceptance to final delivery across the air logistics community.

Crane Cargo has the ability to transform with the industry, growing together with its partners and enabling the air logistics community to achieve their strategic objectives whether it is to maximize customer experience, boost revenues or improve operational efficiency.",cargo management technology

Abstract

Technology has greatly transformed our day-to-day life ranging from my social life to the way we carry out our business transactions. With current technology, customers can make orders of their items from favorite stores, make payments online or via mobile money transfer services but the challenge has always been on the physical delivery of the goods be it parcels or cargo. Courier companies especially the bus companies and security firms have tried to fill this gap. Most delivery companies though haven’t yet aligned their strategies with the changes in technology. This has led to huge differences between delivery companies in terms of the market share. Lack of proper technology in place has led to most companies experiencing problems like piling of cargo and parcels at their stations and lack of trust from its customers hence hindering their growth and expansion. Parcel and Cargo management system is designed to help customers track their goods from transit to delivery and the delivery companies optimize their delivery services. The system uses online based technology to achieve its goal. The reports and analytics generated by the system gives a detailed analysis and summary of movement of parcels in and out of the company. The huge popularity of mobile phones has greatly influenced the design of this system therefore making the project realistic and achievable.",cargo management technology

Using the right technology has become an essential component of any business, and new applications are being developed faster than ever before. This has fuelled a wave of competition over the last 5+ years in particular by lowering the barriers to entry for new start-ups and disrupting many industries.



In our current e-commerce driven world, freight and shipping is no longer an afterthought for any business. It is a core component of your customer service experience and when it’s done well, it can be a key differentiator, but when it’s done poorly, your customers can be quick to move on.

Golden Triangle Ventures will acquire Cargo Management Group of Miami, the investment firm announced May 24.

The acquisition will support Golden Triangle Ventures’ plan to bolster the operations of its wholly owned subsidiary Lavish Entertainment, a concert production business, which seeks to develop and acquire operations in logistics, staffing, equipment and production. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

Cargo Management Group, a provider of truckload, drayage, brokerage and last-mile services, also maintains “high-paying specialized loads in the gaming industry that transport slot machines to locations nationwide,” according to the release.

Golden Triangle Ventures, known by its stock symbol GTVH, is a consulting conglomerate focused on health, entertainment and technology. It’s based in the Las Vegas area.

“The acquisition of Cargo Management Group and its operations provides GTVH with a solid income stream to support its ambitions,” said Tom Zarro, owner of Cargo Management Group and largest noteholder in the investment firm. “The trucking and freight brokerage industry, being recession-proof, scalable and profitable, perfectly aligns with their goal.”

Zarro is confident Golden Triangle Ventures will grow Cargo Management Group, a business he helped launch in 2011, he said.



“With the expertise of the GTVH team, I have no doubt they will significantly expand this enterprise far beyond my current capabilities, given my time constraints,” he said. “Entrusting a reliable business partner to manage the company I built will allow me to focus on new ventures.”

The timeline for the acquisition was not disclosed. Golden Triangle Ventures was working to finalize the deal and transfer ownership of Cargo Management Group’s logistics operation, brokerage, licenses and other assets as of late last month.

The investment firm plans to incorporate all types of trucking freight movements and adding heavy haul into its logistics division.

Cargo Management Group made nearly $3 million in revenue in 2023, according to the release. It currently has contracts with J.B. Hunt Transport Services, C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Coyote Logistics and Echo Global Logistics.",cargo management technology

The installed base of fleet management systems in South ...,https://iotbusinessnews.com/2024/06/12/71877-the-installed-base-of-fleet-management-systems-in-south-africa-to-reach-3-8-million-units-by-2028/,1 день назад,"According to a new research report from the leading IoT analyst firm Berg Insight, the number of active fleet management systems deployed in commercial vehicle fleets in South Africa reached an estimated 2.3 million in Q4-2023.

Growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.3 percent, this number is expected to reach 3.8 million by 2028. South Africa is a relatively mature telematics market and the penetration rate is comparably high from an international perspective. Far from all deployments are however full-scale advanced fleet management solutions. A notable share of the installed fleet telematics systems on the South African market is represented by comparably low-end tracking systems, e.g. light FM solutions, including SVR systems extended with basic FM features.

Rickard Andersson, Principal Analyst, Berg Insight, said:

“The South African fleet management market is clearly dominated by five domestic players with broad telematics portfolios that together represent 70 percent of the total number of fleet management systems in use in the country.”

He adds that Berg Insight ranks Cartrack, Tracker and MiX by Powerfleet (formerly known as MiX Telematics prior to the business combination with Powerfleet) as the largest providers of fleet management solutions in South Africa.

“Cartrack alone has well over half a million active fleet management units in the country”, continued Mr. Andersson.

The remaining top-5 players are Ctrack and Netstar. Other top-10 players on the South African fleet management market include local providers such as Bidtrack (Bidvest Group), Digicell and GPS Tracking Solutions (Eqstra Fleet Management), as well as international players including Lytx and Webfleet (Bridgestone). Gurtam, Autotrak, Digital Matter, Scania and Powerfleet (excluding MiX by Powerfleet) are additional top-15 providers. Players just outside of the top list with at least an estimated 10,000 units include Key Telematics (Radius), FleetCam, iCAM Video Telematics, Geotab, Mtrack (Electronic Tracking Systems) and Globaltrack.

“In addition to Scania, comparably large installed bases of OEM fleet telematics systems in South Africa have also been achieved by manufacturers such as Volvo Trucks, Daimler Truck and UD Trucks”, concluded Mr. Andersson.

The new study also includes an outlook on the overall African market. Africa is clearly a highly diverse geographic region from a fleet management perspective. The continent can in general be divided into three subregions – South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa) and Northern Africa. The South African fleet telematics market is far ahead of the rest of the continent in terms of adoption, whereas Sub-Saharan Africa is the least developed region if excluding South Africa. Northern Africa is comparably advanced and well ahead of Sub-Saharan Africa when it comes to fleet telematics penetration, though still quite a bit behind South Africa.

The African fleet management market beyond South Africa is by many industry representatives described as challenging. The weak economic conditions and foreign exchange rate fluctuations in combination with the unstable political climate make the Rest of Africa market a challenging business environment overall. There are however promising prospects for players adapting to the local market dynamics as the Rest of Africa market has considerably more untapped opportunity than what South Africa can offer at this stage.",fleet optimization startups

Why is Fleet Management Important for a Business?,https://www.biz4intellia.com/blog/why-is-fleet-management-important-for-a-business/,N/A,"Let it be the sector of logistics or any other vertical that depends on trucks for transportation of its products, the presence of a fleet management system is a pre-requisite. It is an essential software that allow fleet operators to track the location of the trucks conveying the deliverables along with other parameters.

But why is the need for fleet management systems so predominant? Well, for starters, it is quite easy to monitor 5 or 10 trucks manually. You can hire a fleet operator who can be on call with truck drivers to know the status of the delivery.

The main problem arises when the fleet grows to a size of more than 50 trucks. And we all know that the average size of a fleet is much larger than that. It hence becomes almost impossible for a company to manage the operations of the fleet manually. In a nutshell, without a completely-packed fleet tracking solution, companies will fail in their tasks that depend completely on the fleet trucks.

Let us see some of the potential problems that a company is inclined to face in the absence of fleet track systems:

Contact us Now and Connect With Our in House IoT Expert! Get in touch

1) Lack of Real-Time Supervisory Information:

The simplest yet the most beneficial aspect that you’ll miss from the absence of a fleet management system is the large amount of data-volume that you can use to enhance your fleet operations.

Fleet management system, enable a person to monitor any vehicle in real-time. Not only the location of trucks, but other parameters like speed, acceleration, and braking actions can also be monitored remotely. Hence, you can ensure the exact time on which the driver delivered the shipment to the customer. Moreover, you can also check the amount of work and effort your truck drivers put in to accomplish the given task.

2) More Fuel Consumption:

You may trust your truck drivers enough to ask them for their exact locations on call but how can you trust them with other factors on a telephonic conversation. For example, they may ask you for more money to fill the gas saying that they exhausted the fuel in the tank. You won’t have proper evidence to confirm if the fuel tank really emptied or if the driver was lying to you. Moreover, you also can’t confirm if the truck ran out of gas due to illicit driving habits. Still, you’ll have to pay them to make sure that your customers receive their goods on time.

However, with a vehicle management system, you can track the amount of fuel consumed by the truck and also track the parameters that result in its depletion quickly. Thus, you can make sure that the truck has an appropriate amount of fuel at all times and also mitigate factors to reduce fuel costs.

3) Delayed Deliveries:

Without the help of a vehicle management system, you won’t have a way to determine aspects that resulted in a delay of the cargo delivery. These systems will help your fleet handlers to have live information about service schedules form any location at any time. Hence, they will have a clear picture of the current location of the cargo conveying truck along with its estimated time of arrival at the customers’ doorsteps.

Additionally, the time associated with arranging and report-making procedures will also decrease considerably. Since all the information will be available on the software, all you’ll have to do is download the information and print out its hard copy. This will help you reduce mundane documentation tasks and focus more on other productive tasks.

Furthermore, since you’ll be monitoring live data related to cargo shipment, you can track various variables in real-time and make sure to reduce discrepancies that may result in delayed delivery of the shipment.

4) Driver Management:

There are different factors that may break your record of on-time deliveries. However, in most cases, all these factors are somehow related to truckers. They are the most important link to a business that depends on trucks for the transportation of its products. It doesn’t matter if your fleet has as much as 1000 trucks unless you don’t have a series of skilled and good truckers.

With the help of fleet management software, you’ll have a deep insight into the driving habits of truckers such as their usual speed, route selection, etc. You can share this information with the respective drivers to help them uplift their profiles and use improve their driving and cargo handling habits.

Moreover, you can also make sure that drivers comply with traffic rules so that they don’t get stopped by law enforcement. Moreover, you’ll be able to make sure that the driver is indulged in safe driving habits and doesn’t speed up unnecessarily.

On a Concluding Note:

Fleet management systems are quite essential for industries that deal with trucks for the transportation of their products. They are a necessary aspect for a company as they boost up its supply chain and plays a crucial role in boosting the customer satisfaction rate.

Even though there are various fleet management systems present in the market, the ones using the Internet of Things as a framework are a notch above the others. An IoT powered fleet management system creates a wide-spread connected environment between trucks and the fleet handlers using a platform hub. It use a myriad range of sensors that can keep a track of variables that may affect the timely delivery of the products.

By using the prowess of IoT, companies can boost their methodologies and create a seamless framework for monitoring and management of fleet vehicles.",fleet optimization startups
Decision - FLEET SERVICES PROJECT,https://democracy.plymouth.gov.uk/ieDecisionDetails.aspx?Id=2617,N/A,"Anthony Payne (Strategic Director for Place) submitted a report on the business case, including an options appraisal, for the fleet services project and proposing the introduction of category management which would better utilise the Council’s fleet services, reduce the number of vehicles and improve the procurement of them to deliver significant financial savings.

The report also indicated that the preferred option, option 2, –

(a) would require investments in fleet systems including control and tracker systems; (b) would involve the development of the fleet management and maintenance teams; (c) would result in the further efficiency of the workshop by improvements to the productivity of the workshop and garage function; (d) would require an investment in IT amounting to £118k over a three year period and aimed to provide a total cumulative financial benefit of £2.05m by the end of the financial year 2016/17; (e) was the most cost effective and beneficial option.

Councillor Vincent (Cabinet Member for Environment) introduced the proposals and referred to the three proposed work streams associated with option 2, as follows –

(f) Fleet Management IT (FMIT) - the procurement and installation of both a FMIT system and a vehicle tracking system; (g) Finance Management: the monitoring of the procurement and commissioning of vehicular assets amongst the Council; (h) Commercialisation: exploration and consideration of additional commercial opportunities that were available to fleet and garage services including examining the potential to work with partner organisations, as well as reviewing the current taxi MOT and licensing policy.

Simon Dale (Interim Assistant Director for Street Services) and Stuart Cooper (Project Manager) attended the meeting for this item and Simon Dale advised that category management was a new initiative for the Council and referred to the benefits from the four way camera system which had already been installed in refuse collection vehicles.

Councillor Evans (Council Leader) referred to the draft minute following the joint scrutiny review that had been held by the Working and Your Plymouth Panels on 28 August 2014 which supported the recommendations within the proposed business case in relation to this item.

Alternative options considered and reasons for the decision –

As set out in the report.

Agreed the business case for the introduction of category management for Fleet Services, together with option 2 of the option’s appraisal and the associated three work streams.",fleet optimization startups

Type: Dissertation

Abstract:

This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a modern fleet management system in improving the logistics of transporting staff, goods and materials in Kenya Power & Lighting Company, a utility firm in power distribution. In today’s competitive marketplace which is characterised by rapidly changing business requirements, leveraging leading edge technologies and adopting best practices are essential in order to ensure sound logistical support that guarantees both effectiveness and efficiency in the transportation processes. The sampling procedure of one-stage, cluster sampling and the use of the simple random sampling technique were used in this study to select a sample size which was sufficiently representative of the whole population. Both the descriptive study approach and the survey research strategy were adopted to enable the collection of data in a manner that allowed in-depth examination while gathering information that explained the relationships between constructs, in particular, cause and effect relationships. The main purpose of this dissertation was therefore to establish that the use of information technology is feasible in transport industries, explain possible obstacles and also any major advantages of its implementation. Secondly, as regards the theoretical aspect, a broadened view on the use of online tracking for vehicles using a global positioning system is presented, together with practical examples, to illustrate its successful implementation in a fleet management system. The study concludes by offering suggestions and recommendations from the research results and the researcher’s experiences for future studies.",fleet optimization startups

6 Fleet Management Tips To Improve Your Delivery Business,https://insights.workwave.com/industry/home-delivery/6-fleet-management-tips-to-improve-your-delivery-business/,N/A,"The safety and productivity of vehicles and drivers are key to realizing a company’s service goals and sales. This calls for management that considers every aspect of the fleet.

That means you need to consider everything, from purchasing vehicles to organizing their operation and communicating with drivers. Otherwise, you may let important things slip through the cracks, which can be detrimental to your business. It may end up costing the business money, wasting valuable time, and frustrating you.

Read on to learn six fleet management tips to help you manage your fleet effectively and keep it in top shape.

1. Preventive Maintenance to Save On Fleet Management Costs

If you can maintain your vehicles properly, you’ll avoid unplanned repairs and wasting time. Preventative maintenance includes changing oils, inspecting and rotating tires, and inspecting the vehicle for overall safety.

Regular oil changes at set intervals, after a vehicle travels a certain mileage, are effective measures for avoiding wastage, but more is required. Rotating tires regularly and general vehicle inspection is also essential. Remember, during these checks, the vehicles undergo a thorough scan all over, including the tire pressure and fluid levels.

Preventive maintenance helps you prevent problems that may cost you much more to restore a vehicle to its previous good condition. That way, your fleet runs smoother and you can better realize the profits from work orders.

2. Consider Vehicle Specs

Before purchasing a vehicle to replace the one you’ve disposed of, it’s a good idea to consider all the demands the vehicle should fulfill. By taking your time to explain the vehicle’s intended use, you cut costs long-term.

If you invest in an under-specified vehicle, for instance, one that doesn’t fit your usage or the loads you carry, it may be detrimental later on. The vehicle may require a lot of maintenance, costing you a lot of money in the long run.

Similarly, avoid utilizing over-specified vehicles. Otherwise, you’ll increase costs unnecessarily.

Therefore, a vital consideration in how to manage a fleet of vehicles is to avoid getting the wrong replacement vehicle, and make sure to specify vehicles based on factors such as their operating conditions, usage, and type of load being transported.

3. Monitor Your Total Cost of Ownership Closely

As an automobile gets older, its maintenance costs usually start to increase, something you need to pay close attention to. Additionally, understand what the manufacturer’s warranty covers, to what extent, and the impact on your total ownership cost.

A very effective way to retain a cost-effective fleet is by keeping yourself informed on the asset’s residual value, market trends in used vehicles, and the right time to make a sale or dispose of a vehicle.

4. Regular Checks on Tire Pressure

Tire pressure is very important as it contributes to the safety of your driver and the vehicle itself.

The question is, how often do you check your tire pressure?

Often people overlook this vital aspect of vehicle maintenance, but the impact of doing so is bigger than you think.

You see tire pressure and air temperature acting on tire pressure affect tire wear, fuel mileage, and overall vehicle handling. Therefore, to ensure your vehicle and driver are safe all seasons, cultivate and instill in your team the culture of checking tire pressure regularly.

5. Explain the Company Policy to Your Drivers

Have you clearly outlined the policies that govern the operation of your fleet? If so, you’re on the right path, but more is required. It’s best to communicate the same to your drivers, making them aware of their responsibilities too.

Inform them of your organization’s preventive maintenance schedules, and driver policies such as driver safety, hours of use, driver-required level of customer service, and maintenance policies.

In addition, it should be clear that there will be repercussions for going against the company’s policy. In fact, any aftermath of their actions is solely their responsibility.

Every successful fleet has a clear policy that guides everyone and must be followed to the letter.

6. Create a Strong Relationship With Your Fleet Maintenance Service Provider

Fleet maintenance providers are key players in the success of your fleet. They’re the people you turn to any time a vehicle has an issue requiring their input.

For example, your vehicle may run into an issue during repair that may require intervention from your fleet maintenance provider. In such a case, don’t hesitate to notify them as they’ll assist in the repair.

With a healthy and successful partnership with your fleet maintenance provider, you’ll improve your customers’ satisfaction, optimize productivity, and reduce downtime.

Final Word

Although fleets vary from one organization to another, there’s a common goal when it comes to how to manage fleet vehicles—to reduce costs, improve efficiency and safety, increase productivity, and increase customer satisfaction. By implementing the fleet management tips mentioned above, you’re well on the way to maintaining a top-notch fleet that delivers the most value to your business.",fleet optimization startups
Fleet Logistics scales up Global Mobility Solutions business,https://www.fleetlogistics.com/es/newsroom/fleet-logistics-scales-global-mobility-solutions-business/,N/A,"Fleet Logistics scales up Global Mobility Solutions business

Mobility / Smart Mobility

Fleet Logistics Group, Europe's largest independent fleet management company, has scaled up its Global Mobility Solutions division (GMS) as part of its plans to transition from pure fleet management provider to offering new Managed Mobility Solutions to its clients and prospects.

Head of GMS, Thibault Alleyn, has appointed Madelaine Webster, formerly of Fleet Logistics UK and Ireland, to the newly created role of Global Consulting Manager, as the division accelerates growth plans following a spike in business levels and growing market interest during the pandemic.

GMS, which was created last autumn, brings together the expertise and market intelligence of Fleet Logistics’ consulting team with the data management and analytical skills of its international reporting team.

Thibault Alleyn said: “We are delighted that Madelaine has accepted this new role within our GMS team and are confident that her years of experience in fleet optimization and new mobilities will bring an immense value to our clients.

“In light of the current pandemic, companies are currently redefining their employee benefits related to fleet and mobility, as more people question the value of having only a large company car in the light of a broader mix of mobility types becoming available.

“This includes mobility budgets and mobility offers in a new ‘sharing’ economy, which complement, for instance, a smaller-sized company car. This is exactly what our MobilityBUDGET product offers, in a straightforward, effective and fully digital way.”

Alleyn added: “Madelaine will play a key role in helping us shape our response to this corporate move to embrace greater and enhanced mobility options, as we define and introduce new products and developments. Besides this, she will be managing GMS client relations as well as steering and delivering consultancy assignments at a global level.

“Meanwhile, Phil Reeves, Technology Team Manager, will continue to guide GMS together with Madelaine and myself, alongside his role of overseeing reporting innovations, providing support for clients using state-of-the-art interactive business intelligence solutions, and day-to-day management of a team of experienced analysts involved in client and internal projects.”

Reeves commented: “We are delighted with the level of interest shown in GMS by both current and new clients. Madelaine has joined at an exciting time when we are looking to expand the division to meet increased customer demand and interest.”

Webster, who joined Fleet Logistics two years ago, has spent over 15 years in the UK fleet industry and sits on the Association of Fleet Professionals’ Future Mobility Steering Committee in the UK.

She said she was ‘greatly looking forward to the new opportunities GMS offers at an international level’.

“The world of corporate mobility is changing as companies look to offer their employees the opportunity to choose from an array of different mobility solutions.

“This still, of course, includes the traditional company car, but it’s role, too, is evolving. One particular area of emphasis for us will be the growing movement towards alternative solutions and the opportunities and challenges that this presents for our many international fleet customers,” she said.

Thibault Alleyn added: “We wish to continue to play our role as industry experts, and share insights and knowledge with fleet and mobility stakeholders, independently of in-house or outsourced management.

“Across GMS, whether consultancy, reporting, analytics or publications, everything is based on real life, hands-on experience gained from working for 25 years with some of the world’s major organisations – combined with fact-based forward thinking.

“The fact that Fleet Logistics Group is investing in additional senior managers in this part of the business is a proof of its commitment to shift from a pure fleet management organisation to a managed mobility provider.”

Did you know that the agro-processing industry is more than just agriculture?

It’s the entire life cycle of a final product, from sourcing raw materials to manufacturing it and getting it onto shelves.

Sounds complicated, right? But with the right solution in place, it doesn’t have to be. That solution is a fleet management system, helping you streamline all operations and unlock ultimate efficiency.

‍

In this article, you will: Learn what agro-processing is

Uncover the link between agro-processing and supply chain management

Delve into the challenges faced in agro-processing

Explore how fleet management can help you solve these challenges

Discover how Cartrack’s solutions are the keys to ultimate efficiency in agro-processing

‍

Let’s define agro-processing

Agro-processing defines all the activities that are carried out to transform a product from raw goods that come from agriculture, forestry or marine life, into a final, usable product.

With an abundance of raw materials, South Africa is fertile ground for a successful and globally impactful agro-processing business. In 2020, agro-processing products made up about 11% of South Africa’s exports, making the global demand and competitiveness of the industry make the country a globally competitive exporter. With an estimated output of R240 billion per year, agro-processing is considered the country’s second most important manufacturing sector based on its gross value added.

As fantastic as this sounds, it doesn’t mean that agro-processing is without its challenges. Let’s find out what they are.

‍

What are the challenges faced in agro-processing

South Africa’s agro-processing industry is designed to meet global needs, which means the challenges it faces are greater. Let’s take a look at them:

The storage of raw materials Since agro-processing is the entire production process, the storage of raw materials used to make final products is important for a successful operation. Unfortunately, it can be a big challenge that affects efficiency, productivity, and the quality of goods provided.

‍ Keeping temperature sensitive goods fresh To keep your goods fresh during the production process, cold storage facilities need to be used in every stage, including storage and transportation. With the smallest change in temperature, the quality and freshness of these goods can suffer. These goods include:- Medical products: From medicine components to insulin and medical devices, medical products need to be protected from heat or cold.

‍

– Meat: Meat is susceptible to bacterial growth, making keeping it chilled essential in every step of the production process, from the slaughterhouse to the processing and transportation.

‍

– Fruit: From the harvesting to the packaging process, fruits need to be kept cool as this prevents them from losing their nutritional value and spoiling. Not keeping the right temperature for these goods during each stage of production causes goods to spoil and increases the risk of cross-contamination.

‍ High production costs: Because agro-processing is complex, it has a lot of cost-draining stages. These include:- Storing raw materials: Keeping raw materials stored according to their individual needs ensures freshness and quality. However, catering to this need through every stage of agro-processing can be both challenging and costly.

‍

– Manufacturing final goods with raw materials: Manufacturing processes are very complex, which makes keeping processes efficient, safe, and cost-effective important.

‍

– Packaging goods: Packaging goods can be quite costly, as the process and materials need to be specific to the product. For example, the containers used for keeping ice cream frozen aren’t the same as the containers used for packaging cool drinks.

‍

– Delivering goods to wholesalers, retailers, and restaurants: The final stage of processing is getting the goods to the places where they will be sold. These deliveries can be complex, as routes need to be optimised, drivers need to be trained, and trailers need to be prepared for temperature-sensitive goods.All these challenges and the duties sound quite familiar, right? This would be correct because they are closely linked to supply chain management.

‍

‍

Unpacking the link between agro-processing and supply chain management

The supply chain management process is the handling of the entire process of the flow of goods and services. This process starts with the raw components needed to manufacture a good, all the way to delivering the final product to sellers. Let’s explore these steps in a bit more detail:

Planning: Knowledge is power, and when you’re in supply chain management, this is important to ensuring product availability. In this step, supply chains need to establish the customer demand for the products they will be supplying because this helps them know exactly how much of a certain product they need to order.Let’s take John, for example, who runs a frozen fruit business. Before he begins planning how he will package his products or where he will sell them, he needs to establish the demand for his product. With this information, he can effectively budget, keep his inventory balanced, and ensure customer needs are always met.

‍

Sourcing: Also known as procurement, this stage involves finding and purchasing the materials or ingredients you will need to meet customer demand . In this stage, businesses must find suppliers, ensure that the products being purchased meet the company standards, negotiate the price (who doesn’t love some cost savings, right?), and get the right amount of the product or material needed for production.Let’s go back to John. In this stage of the supply chain, John needs to place orders for fresh fruits based on the customer demand he identified during the planning stage. With this information, he can make sure he orders the right amount of fruit, to ensure he doesn’t lose money due to overstocked goods spoiling.

‍

Production: In this stage, your raw materials are turned into finished goods by using specialised equipment. This stage involves using information on the total number of products that need to be produced to create finished products that will meet customer needs.Let’s look at John’s business of frozen produce. In this stage of the supply chain, John takes the fruit that he purchased, and puts it through a quick-freezing process done by using specialised machinery. His decision on how many packages he needs to produce is based on the numbers he recorded during the “planning” stage.

‍

Distribution: Now that the goods have been manufactured, it’s time for them to move to where they will be sold. This can include supermarkets, garages, convenience stores, and even customers who wish to buy directly from the business.For John, this step involves using cold chain logistic solutions to transport his frozen fruits from the factory or warehouse to the various places where they will be sold.

‍

Making agro-processing a breeze with a fleet management system

Whether it be two or two hundred vehicles, fleet management helps businesses stay safe, profitable, and efficient, making it important to the overall success of a fleet. A fleet management system simplifies the entire process, making it possible to keep your fleet running at its optimum level from the comfort of your laptop, computer, tablet, or cell phone.

‍

The top three benefits of a fleet management system for your agro-processing business

The beauty of a fleet management system is that it can be tailored to any industry’s individual needs. Let’s look at the big three benefits a fleet management system can bring to your agro-processing business:

1. Improved vehicle and cargo visibility

Whether you’re in the business of providing raw materials to different businesses or you’re delivering your final products to stores, tracking your vehicles is crucial to the efficiency and safety of your agro-processing operation. With access to real-time location updates, you can quickly locate goods, determine their ETAs, instantly spot delays, and improve your vehicle and cargo safety.

2. Your goods stay fresher for longer

Whether it be fresh fruits or cold meats, your temperature-sensitive goods need to be kept fresh during delivery. A fleet management system gives you access to real-time temperature monitoring that helps you spot sudden temperature spikes or dips. This ensures that you can quickly handle these fluctuations before they damage your stock.

3. Improve driver behaviour and cargo safety

Everyone who sits behind the wheel of a fleet vehicle needs to drive responsibly. A fleet management system simplifies monitoring your driver’s behaviour, helping you quickly spot areas for improvement that could potentially damage the business’s functionality and keeping your drivers safe at all times. Regarding agro-processing, improving driver behaviour helps you ensure safe cargo transportation so your goods reach their destination intact.

Do these benefits sound like something you’d like to unlock for your business? Then we have the key to that: It’s Cartrack’s fleet management solutions.

That's a big drop and it's a trend that continues to happen today. If you are managing your fleet in-house, you are actually in the minority of business owners. So why are so many small to medium-sized businesses choosing to turn the job over to an experienced Charlotte fleet management company? Ultimately, it's about saving time and money.

How You Can Save Money

A lot of companies choose to do their fleet management in-house because they believe it will end up saving them money. In the long run, it doesn't. Fleets that aren't professionally managed are going to end up costing the company more in both repairs and lost time.

That's something no company can afford. Small and medium-sized businesses have to keep a vigilant eye on the bottom line to stay in business. When outsourcing becomes the more affordable option for fleet management, they can't ignore it. But how does outsourcing fleet management save money?

Lowering the cost of repairs. A professional fleet manager is going to spend time focusing on preventative maintenance for your vehicles. Preventative maintenance can help prevent costlier, longer repair work in the future. Things like tire rotation, oil changes, and other maintenance can keep a fleet running problem-free a lot longer. During the lifetime of your vehicle, you'll end up spending less keeping it running.

Find the right vehicle at the right price. Fleet management companies often have an internal department of specialists who can help you find the right vehicle when you need a new one. They can help your business save money by leasing instead of buying, too. It's their job to work with your budget to find a suitable addition to your fleet.

Do you need a full-time fleet manager on staff? When companies have a fleet manager in-house, they could be paying someone a full-time salary when they don't need to be. Instead, they can save labor costs and turn the work over to an external team. That frees your budget up for more important business growth endeavors.

When companies end up managing their fleets in-house, they have to invest capital in the job. That means buying expensive fleet management software. It could also mean investing in some of the tools needed to do the maintenance themselves. It's a huge expense that some small businesses won't want to--or even can't--take on.

How You Can Save Time

Business owners and managers wear a lot of hats within the company. They might do some of the sales, some of the marketing, and even some of the maintenance. What they shouldn't be doing is fleet management.

Fleet News writes, ""Many day-to-day tasks involving fleets are also time-consuming and becoming more complicated."" Devoting enough internal resources to handle them can be an expensive task, and many people don't have the expertise to do it effectively.

When you can turn this area of your business over to a trusted outside source, you'll be able to devote more of your time doing what you do best: growing your business. How much time are you currently spending managing your own fleet? Here are some of the ways a professional team can help your business work faster.

Focus your attention on business growth. This should be the focus of everyone in your business, not just the owner or manager. But when people need to focus on tasks like fleet management, they aren't focused on business growth. Free up that time and give your team the opportunity to find ways to serve customers and bring in more business.

When your fleet is down, your team comes to a stop. That means you aren't serving the customers who depend on your services. If the repair work is severe enough, vehicles can be out of service for weeks. That amounts to a lot of lost productivity time.

Not only is your team depending on your fleet, so are your customers. When it takes longer for your team to respond to customer needs, it affects your credibility. You don't want to end up with a poor public rating online because a broken-down truck in your fleet delayed your response time.

You don't want to end up with a poor public rating online because a broken-down truck in your fleet delayed your response time. Fast driver support. External fleet management companies will provide your team with a number they can call whenever they need assistance. This can result in quicker response time to a driver experiencing trouble out on the road. The sooner they can get help, the sooner they are back out on the road.

This About Better Fleet Care

A lot of businesses rely on their fleet for their livelihood. Without their trucks and vans, they wouldn't be able to respond to customer calls. When your fleet is that important, you have to give it top-rated care. That can be hard to do when it's not your only task.

Fleet management companies devote their time and energy to taking care of your fleet. They ensure it has the care and maintenance required for dependable service when you (and your customers) need it the most.

Using a Charlotte fleet management company can help keep your vehicles going. They can keep track of your maintenance schedules to ensure your vehicles are getting the service they need.

They can help you find a great replacement vehicle when it's time for one. And they can customize fleet solutions to the needs of your company. Outsourcing fleet management can be an effective solution that helps your bottom line grow.

South Africa's installed base of fleet management systems to ...,https://news.satnews.com/2024/06/11/south-africas-installed-base-of-fleet-management-systems-to-reach-3-8-million-units-by-2028/,1 день назад,"According to a new research report from the leading IoT analyst firm Berg Insight, the number of active fleet management systems deployed in commercial vehicle fleets in South Africa reached an estimated 2.3 million in Q4-2023. Growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.3 percent, this number is expected to reach 3.8 million by 2028. South Africa is a relatively mature telematics market and the penetration rate is comparably high from an international perspective. Far from all deployments are however full-scale advanced fleet management solutions. A notable share of the installed fleet telematics systems on the South African market is represented by comparably low-end tracking systems, e.g. light FM solutions, including SVR systems extended with basic FM features.

“The South African fleet management market is clearly dominated by five domestic players with broad telematics portfolios that together represent 70 percent of the total number of fleet management systems in use in the country”, said Rickard Andersson, Principal Analyst, Berg Insight. He adds that Berg Insight ranks Cartrack, Tracker and MiX by Powerfleet (formerly known as MiX Telematics prior to the business combination with Powerfleet) as the largest providers of fleet management solutions in South Africa. “Cartrack alone has well over half a million active fleet management units in the country”, continued Mr. Andersson.

The remaining top-5 players are Ctrack and Netstar. Other top-10 players on the South African fleet management market include local providers such as Bidtrack (Bidvest Group), Digicell and GPS Tracking Solutions (Eqstra Fleet Management), as well as international players including Lytx and Webfleet (Bridgestone). Gurtam, Autotrak, Digital Matter, Scania and Powerfleet (excluding MiX by Powerfleet) are additional top-15 providers. Players just outside of the top list with at least an estimated 10,000 units include Key Telematics (Radius), FleetCam, iCAM Video Telematics, Geotab, Mtrack (Electronic Tracking Systems) and Globaltrack. “In addition to Scania, comparably large installed bases of OEM fleet telematics systems in South Africa have also been achieved by manufacturers such as Volvo Trucks, Daimler Truck and UD Trucks”, concluded Mr. Andersson.

The new study also includes an outlook on the overall African market. Africa is clearly a highly diverse geographic region from a fleet management perspective. The continent can in general be divided into three subregions — South Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa) and Northern Africa. The South African fleet telematics market is far ahead of the rest of the continent in terms of adoption, whereas Sub-Saharan Africa is the least developed region if excluding South Africa. Northern Africa is comparably advanced and well ahead of Sub-Saharan Africa when it comes to fleet telematics penetration, though still quite a bit behind South Africa. The African fleet management market beyond South Africa is by many industry representatives described as challenging. The weak economic conditions and foreign exchange rate fluctuations in combination with the unstable political climate make the Rest of Africa market a challenging business environment overall. There are however promising prospects for players adapting to the local market dynamics as the Rest of Africa market has considerably more untapped opportunity than what South Africa can offer at this stage.

Business Leasing Programs and Fleet Management,https://www.seligleasing.com/leasing-funding/,N/A,"Lease Options

Open-End Lease

Our signature lease product is the Open-End Lease. With the guidance of the lessor, the lessee determines the depreciation rate on the vehicle and assumes responsibility for any gain or loss from the sale of the vehicle. Vehicles can be replaced based upon mileage rather than term. It combines the flexibility of ownership with the cash flow advantages and tax benefits you get from leasing. Open-End Leases generally are commercial leases, making it easier to manage a fleet of vehicles.

Advantages include freeing up capital and bank credit lines for more vital expenditures, no mileage restrictions or wear-and-tear charges, and it provides flexibility as your needs change. Open-End Leases are best for companies that like to have an equity interest in their vehicles, as well as a flexible vehicle replacement policy, and can use leasing as an alternate source of funds.

Closed-End Lease

The Closed-End lease is set up for a specific number of months and pre-determined mileage limits. The lessee is responsible for abnormal wear-and-tear charges and any excess mileage. Closed-End Leases generally are suitable for lessees who need to minimize risk and be able to easily and accurately budget for their fleet, prefer a defined termination point and replacement policy of their leases and have predictable mileage habits.

Advantages include no depreciation risk (assumed by Selig Leasing) and insulation from used car market conditions, walk away convenience, as well as the off balance sheet financing and increased credit line availability afforded to lessees.",fleet optimization startups

Disrupting the Mining Industry: The Role of Technology,https://www.halconprimo.com/disrupting-the-mining-industry-the-role-of-technology/,N/A,"The mining industry is facing significant disruptions to its traditional supply chain model due to advances in technology. With automation and advanced data analytics, it is now possible for mining companies to optimise their operations and reduce their reliance on manual labour. This is leading to increased efficiency and productivity, but at the same time it is also disrupting the established supply chain models that have been in place for decades.

In addition to harnessing automation and data analytics, the mining industry is also looking at leveraging renewable energy sources to reduce mining operation costs. And with increased pressure from the various stakeholders to reduce emissions, the need for cleaner alternative energy sources becomes even more urgent. Renewable energy technology is a key factor in this transition as it provides the necessary infrastructure to support the implementation of renewable energy sources in the mining industry.

Advantages of Renewable Energy Technology in Mining

Renewable energy has the potential to significantly transform the mining industry and its supply chain. In addition to cost savings and environmental benefits, the use of renewable energy can also help improve the industry’s stability and resilience. As mentioned earlier, the mining industry is facing disruptions to traditional supply chains due to technological advances. By embracing renewable energy technology, mining companies can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels and the associated supply chain risks. This can help ensure a more stable and continuous flow of materials and products, improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the industry.

Adopting a Sustainability Model for Mining Supply Chains

The transition to renewable energy sources will require considerable effort. This means that mining companies need to develop sustainable strategies and adopt technologies that focus on reducing their reliance on fossil fuels while ensuring that everything else is still functioning as efficiently as possible. Sustainable supply chains should also be designed with an eye towards the reduction of wastage to minimise their environmental impact. This requires looking at how different components of the supply chain can be connected and optimised, these include transport, storage, and other processes. However, the development of sustainable supply chains requires significant investment, and the use of a good logistics service provider solves this.

The Role of a Good Logistics Service Provider in the Mining Industry

With mining companies adopting a shift in mindset and a deep understanding of the underlying forces driving the industry’s transformation, mining companies would then realise how vital it is to have a good logistics service provider to help them gain a competitive edge. Through the insights and advice provided, mining companies can take a proactive approach in identifying potential disruptions and developing strategies to mitigate their impact.

Not only will a good logistics service provider provide valuable advice to help mining companies understand the impact that renewable energy and technology has on their supply chain as well as methods to manage it, such logistic service providers are also adept at providing a wide variety of industry solutions. This includes managing the entire transportation and storage process as well as developing customised solutions that are tailored to a mining company’s specific needs.

Choose Halcon Primo Logistics

News,https://awisca.org/news,N/A,"Logistics management can be rewarding, satisfying, and lucrative â but for companies and consumers alike, itâs still only a means to an end. The end is profit and happy consumption. And in 2018, the logistics industry will confront many challenges in delivering both. Hereâs why:



Consumers only expect what the best innovator can deliver



If you remember a couple years ago, business enemy number one was the all-powerful millennial consumer who ditches brands at the slightest provocation and demands the world. Well, people have sobered on that idea a bit. It turns out consumers arenât inventing new expectations out of thin air and hurling them at brands. Theyâre being taught what to expect, almost entirely by Amazon.



If you look at the history of both consumer and business technology, expectations only rise when thereâs an innovator who can competently execute a disruptive new vision. Cell phones were on a dull path before Apple, as were social networks before Facebook, and electric cars before Tesla. When there hasnât been a competent disruptor, the status quo reigns, like in most enterprise software. Customer expectations for fulfillment were one thing before Amazon, and entirely different after.



For the past few years, the logistics industry has tried to play catch-up to Amazonâs policies, fuelled partially by other etailers struggling to compete. But Amazon will continue to set the stage in 2018. Itâs already extending its logistics management prowess and, more worryingly if youâre a logistics providerâlogistical independenceâvia services like Prime Air and Amazon Flex. It will keep carving its own path and raising the bar. If logistics services are constantly playing catch-up, they risk being disrupted in the very territory they built.



Instead, logistics will have to get ahead of customer expectationsâpartnering more closely with businesses to set entirely new expectations of their own, and deliver innovative services that they can execute competently. With the several past years of being on the chase, 2018 is the time to start turning the tables on Amazon.



Global trade is shaky and requires creative business models to cope



Global trade spent 2017 recovering from the 2015-2016 demand slump. But as Q3 rolled around, another disturbing truth became apparent: Thereâs an oversupply in global freight capacity. This led the worldâs largest ocean carrier, Maersk, to warn about the prospects of a global slowdown in 2018. Add this to the fact that thereâs a political movement for protectionism in western economies while, at the same time, China continues to globalizeâand thereâs a lot of trade uncertainty out there.



How can logistics providers weather this storm? Theyâll have to get creative. Whether that means new business models or more consolidation or partnerships will depend on the severity of the threat. The logistics industry also faces a classic Prisonerâs Dilemma situation. As an entire industry, logistics providers and carriers could cooperate to mitigate the threats they all face. Or, they could continue to undercut one another, exacerbating the industryâs woes for all. 2018 might be a year that forces reckoning with such histories.



Technology is a tool for creativity, but only if used appropriately



If you look purely from a tech point of view, there are several bright spots in the 2018 logistics outlook. UPS recently announced that itâs betting big on blockchain as the backbone of a smart, decentralized, intelligent supply chain network. The appeal of blockchain in transportation and logistics is huge, because logistics information infrastructure is mostly inconsistent and inadequate, with many systems still relying on electronic data interchange (EDI) standards of the 1990s or spreadsheets to pass information haphazardly.



But blockchain is also just plain hip. The fact that an iced tea company can put âblockchainâ in its name and have its valuation skyrocket shows you the kind of crazy hype associated with blockchain. Will all this hype materialise? No, at least not in the way weâre wishing for it today. Some blockchain developments will be legitimately powerful, but like any technology, theyâll only be worth as much as the problems they solve. Logistics providers will need to keep their attention on supply chain problems, not tech specs, if they want to be successful.



On a more tangible technology front, the transportation industry has electric, autonomous vehicles to look forward to. Elon Musk promises Tesla Semi will be nothing short of a revolution for the trucking industry, dramatically lowering the total cost of ownership, and even attempting to undercut rail via Tesla Semiâs driverless convoy mode. UPS, once again, is trying to get out front and has placed the largest public order for Tesla Semis so far.

Will these innovations quell the economic volatilities and deep-rooted problems of the logistics industry? It is unrealistic to say âyesâ or ânoâ and assume things are so simple. Tech innovations happen on both the supply and demand side, and economics forces have a life of their own. There will always be tension between tech solutions and market pressure. But as that tension comes to a head in 2018, thereâll be an added existential anxiety in an industry that is several decades old.



Where is the growth opportunity for logistics in a world where shippers have so much leverage? That question is definitely troubling. Real growth requires confronting great challenges.

Rail News: Internet-Digital

By Michael Popke

In February, BNSF Railway Co. became the first Class I to join the Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA). A handful of other rail companies, including GE Transportation and Bourque Logistics — and rumblings of more to come — also are among BiTA’s more than 230 members. In addition to rail realmers, BiTA comprises truckload carriers, third-party logistics companies, tech firms, major retailers, OEMs, parcel carriers, financial services providers and data analytics specialists collaborating to define new blockchain standards for the logistics industry.

Blockchain is a digital ledger technology capable of recording transactions and storing data in immutable blocks across a distributed network. It enables a digital supply chain and creates a peer-to-peer system of commerce, making it easier for shippers to receive end-to-end information about their shipments, and streamline such processes as customs and interchanges between freight carriers.

“Blockchain technology has the potential to bring significant change to several aspects of the freight transportation industry, specifically how freight shipments are tracked and how paperwork is handled between freight providers,” says Bart Boudreaux, BNSF's director of architecture and emerging technology. “Some of the changes we could see as a result of implementing blockchain technology are end-to-end shipment tracking, paperless interactions with customs and other agencies, and asset lifecycle tracking.”

In 2017, accounting/financial services consulting firm Deloitte tweeted that 10 percent of global gross domestic product eventually would be built on top of blockchain applications. FreightWaves, a data and content forum serving freight markets, claims the technology will “shake up” the $8 trillion freight industry: “Calling blockchain a new type of database is like saying email is a new way of sending people letters.”

Blockchain is a disrupter, and the rail industry needs to pay attention, says Steve Sashihara, co-founder and chief executive officer of Princeton Consultants Inc.

“Blockchain gets us really focused on the digital supply chain by reducing touch labor and improving transparency,” he says “Every railroad is trying to reduce its costs and administrative overhead while also becoming more service friendly. That’s why blockchain is definitely worth focusing on.”

Use of the technology will become common in the rail industry within the next 10 years, and all Class Is eventually will join BiTA — “to at least have observer status of what’s happening,” Sashihara predicts. Larger Class IIs and short lines should ask their biggest customers if blockchain is on their radar, he adds. If it is, that'd give those railroads a concrete reason to pursue the technology.

“The value of blockchain technology in any business sector increases with the number of participants,” Boudreaux says. “To gain broad participation, each party needs to have systems that can interoperate with each other.”

Blockchain is more mature in the financial services sector, but transportation, logistics and the supply chain will be the next industry to adopt it, says Jennifer Schopfer, GE Transportation's vice president of transport logistics.

“We want to help set, influence and think through what blockchain standards should be, but we also want to ensure that rail’s voice is heard loud and clear as part of the BiTA consortium.”

Two BiTA events in May are intended to begin advancing the conversation. The BiTA Spring Symposium, a one-day, members-only event featuring demos, keynotes and breakout sessions focused on disruptive technology and the future of freight, will be held May 21 at the Georgia International Convention Center in Atlanta. Transparency18, a two-day conference focused on building a transparent freight ecosystem, is scheduled for May 22-23 at the same facility, in partnership with BiTA, FreightWaves and Georgia Tech University.

“Railroads will be able to do meaningful smaller projects and pilots leveraging blockchain, but blockchain will be much more impactful when it is adopted at scale, across the network,” Schopfer says. “That’s why the standards and adoption processes are very important, because that is when you will truly start to see the benefits. Eventually, we’re going to need an industrywide solution in order for it to provide maximum benefit.”

From GE Transportation’s perspective, the technology not only represents an opportunity to partner with a blockchain solutions provider and possibly provide some of its own solutions, it also offers the potential to house and maintain locomotive maintenance service records and warranty information.

Another company taking active steps with blockchain technology is Bourque Logistics, which earlier this year unveiled the RAILChain™ platform to explore the application of blockchain technology for its rail shipper clients. Using digitized shipping file formats called “rblocks,” the platform is designed to enable shippers to securely exchange bill of lading information, as well as settle freight, repair and lease costs using smart contract technology, according to the company.

With an initial proof of concept for RAILChain slated for this summer, any blockchain standards and ideas arising from Bourque’s involvement with BiTA will be integrated into the project, company officials say.

“The opportunity with blockchain is to hit a reset button and say, ‘Let’s really streamline this whole thing,’” Sashihara says. “It’s not about just adding another nifty new technology.”

7 Main Disruptors to the Transportation Industry,https://freightcontroller.com.au/freight-trends-2020-7-main-disruptors-to-the-transportation-industry/,N/A,"2020 is just around the corner. So, it seems timely to think about what 2020 and the coming decade will bring us. If you work in the Freight Industry, we’ve compiled a few key freight trend topics on what the near future will bring.

Digitilisation

Industry 4.0 is well on its way. If you don’t start to explore how this will impact your business, you will be quickly left behind. Digitilisation will lead to better connectivity between customer and supply chain via real time information on production, logistics and monitoring.

1. 5G, IOT, (Internet of Things)

5G will start to roll out next year, and theoretically will deliver 1 – 10 Gbps. This will both enhance and compete with the NBN network. IoT infrastructure and 5G capabilities go hand in hand. However, it seems, (according to a recent AIG Group Report), that only some big businesses see the value of IoT & RFID; smaller businesses do not see the value.

Of the businesses that do see value, they belong to the warehouse and transport industries. Those in the food industries also find value in tracking and monitoring their goods for safety reasons.

This growing capability and coverage will enable the move to edge computing which improves real time analytics and ‘on the spot’ decision-making by mobile devices.

2. Artificial Intelligence – AI-as-a-Service

While the big companies such as Google, and Microsoft can afford to invest greatly in this area, regular businesses cannot. And yet they can still start to enjoy the benefits of this development through AI-as-a-Service platforms.

These platforms will become more niche to a business’s services and customer needs, enabling a business to import their data and run it though the systems’ algorithms. Tapping into this digital technology will enhance an organisation’s ability to run predictive analytics; to streamline their processes and better serve their customers.

3. Fresh Deliveries

With online grocery and pharmaceutical shopping capabilities increasing year after year there is a corresponding increase in services to cater for these shipments such as refrigerated, dry, frozen. Complimenting this is the increase in freight companies catering for the growing demand in these two industries, and this reinforces and supports the drive toward IoT technologies for tracking and ensuring shipments stay at the right temperature for health and safety reasons.

4. Electric Autonomous Vehicles and Robotics

Electronic Autonomous Vehicles: some say will transform our streets and cities during the next decade. Some say autonomous trucking will take longer to overcome regulator barriers. Steps toward this change are here now with automatic parking, lane alerts and we will see incremental improvements throughout the coming decade.

Will this lead to a Transport as-a-Service platform with autonomous Uber-style rental of trucks by shippers? Will this bi-pass the carrier companies? Will it be Volkswagon and Telsa, for example, who run these future businesses? How far away this future is, is hard to pinpoint with varying opinions of experts, but it is worth pondering.

Fed Ex’s Roxo may well take the place of the delivery guy, probably not in 2020, but not too far away. This won’t affect services such as linehaul and airfreight but, will affect last mile delivery.

Drones as well will have more of an impact in remote, difficult to reach areas, and in the first and last miles of delivery.

5. Blockchain

Blockchain may be slow to get started but it will gain traction over time. Blockchain in the supply chain industry will enable simultaneous and secure electronic Manifests & Bills of Lading to all: shipper, carrier, forwarder, receiver, regulator, and this can include information such as Dangerous Goods. It can inform of a failure, or impediment in the consignment’s journey and enable the shipper to quickly and proactively find workarounds.

6. Green Logistics and Sustainability

Governments and Businesses around the globe are increasing their efforts to introduce process improvements for reducing their impact on the planet with regard to sustainability and carbon emissions. Customers are starting to incorporate these factors as part of their decision-making processes when reviewing potential partners in freight and logistics.

This reinforces the push toward electronic vehicles, and any analytics that can assist with finding and implementing efficiency gains to a shipper’s freight orders.

7. Retail: Online vs. Bricks and Mortar

Yes, many large chain stores are struggling, some are closing down but, whilst we’re increasing our online shopping, delivering to house, office, post office or parcel locker, there is still a place for bricks and mortar. Beyond the impact of click and collect to stem the tide, shops are starting to incorporate system smarts for observing clients in their store to know what products and services are still compelling them to get in their cars and drive to the store rather than click or hit a button to purchase.

Coupled with this are smart mirror and other MR technologies to personalize and enhance the in-store experience, providing a virtual stylist for trying on clothes and the ability to try make-up and hair styles and colour before purchase and regret.

However, online purchasing and logistics is still going to be a common thread in 2020 and beyond, with B2B purchases starting to catch up to the B2C market. The developments in AI are assisting with the trend towards more eCommerce wholesale orders.

CFOs in Logistics Are on the Move,https://supplychainminded.com/cfos-logistics-move/,N/A,"By Neil Collins and Beau Lambert, Korn Ferry | Industry Week

Logistics and transportation services companies are seeing a major shift in the on-the-job responsibilities of their CFOs, according to in-depth interviews conducted by consulting firm Korn Ferry. This change is attributed to the growing complexity in the sector, technological innovation, the availability of data and an increasing regulatory environment. In this new business climate, CFOs no longer just report number outcomes; they advise and partner with business line leaders and provide a strategic perspective on business decisions.

According to Korn Ferry’s research, these sentiments resonated with CFOs across a broad spectrum of services in the sector, including brokerage, freight forwarding, supply chain and air cargo. They spoke of new skills needed to remain competitive and continue to be seen as adding value. Specifically, CFOs require the ability to make critical decisions around technology investments that improve or “turbo-charge” operations, hedge against supply chain risk and meet new customer demands. CFOs must possess a deep understanding of operations, the ability to leverage data, skills to develop a team of finance executives who demonstrate business acumen, as well as a strong grasp of traditional finance capabilities.

Industry Disruptors: Shifting the Role of the CFO

In recent years, three tightly intertwined industry trends have demanded and evoked change:

customers seeking business-enhancing services;

technological advances that will enable those services;

and data, which will flow from technology and fuel further services and advances.

CFOs are under pressure to make complex and strategic decisions that have a high impact on financial statements in response to increasing demands of customers for real-time services, supply chain visibility, omnichannel fulfillment, interactive analytics, as well as customized and integrated services. To satisfy these demands, CFOs need to invest to a greater extent in IT-based services and stay up-to-date with advanced RFID, GPS tracking and global trade management tools. Advanced route modeling and forecasting solutions will be invaluable to CFOs because the results they produce directly impact financial performance.

According to logistics CFOs, sophisticated data analytics can translate into indispensable knowledge to inform decision-making and, in turn, have a high impact on companies’ financial statements. As a result, analytics are being seen by CFOs as “the next big competitive arena” for logistics providers. Leading companies are now taking customer data and tailoring it into a unique product offering for customers based on preferences and relationships to gain competitive advantage.

As finance and IT responsibilities converge, CFOs now sit at the center of strategic decisions on technology and talent. Consequently, the biggest challenge for these financial leaders is learning how to effectively balance investments in people and systems to support continued growth and maintain profitability over the long term.

Understanding disruptive technology transitions in the ...,https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/RIBS-07-2020-0078/full/html,Автор: J Mikl,"Building on the established ecosystem framework from Adner and Kapoor (2016a), this paper constructs four categories of technology substitution to assess how quickly disruptive change may occur in the global logistics industry and defines key technology substitution determinants in logistics to emphasize the role of ecosystems for further consideration into disruptive innovation theory.

Disruptive technologies in the global logistics industry are often regarded as a threat to the existing business models of incumbents’ companies. Existing research, however, focuses mainly on whether technologies have disruptive potential, thereby neglecting when such disruptive transitions occur. To understand the timing of potential disruptive technological change, this paper aims to investigate the elements of the underlying ecosystem shaping these transitions.

Digital and IT review,https://www.imperiallogistics.com/reports/ar-2021/digital-and-it-review.php,N/A,"Digital and IT review

Connecting Africa and the world, and driving differentiation, optimisation and disruption, means we must acquire, develop and deploy leading digital capabilities. Our digital strategy centres on applying best-of-breed and emerging technologies to provide clients and principals with innovative solutions that differentiate them from their competitors. We embrace market disruptors and leverage innovation so that our clients and principals will not only survive – but thrive – well into the future.

Digitisation, automation, new technologies and data – including consumer engagement, e-commerce and telemedicine – will shape our business models and help futureproof our business and our industry. We are investing heavily in flexible IT architecture and a ‘digital-first’ approach, to offer high-grade automation and best-in-class IT systems – tailored to the processes of our clients, principals and customers.

Our digital platforms and capabilities are a critical enabler of all our strategy pillars and enhancing them will create value for the group across our six value lenses: enabling growth, improving efficiency, enhancing experience, mitigating risk, building our brand and optimising capital.

Go digital, be digital and enable digital

Becoming ‘One Imperial’ and positioning ourselves as the ‘Gateway to Africa’ means placing IT and digital initiatives at the heart of our enterprise. It is our technological prowess that will determine Imperial’s differentiation, market relevance, client experience and ability to sustain profitable growth. Although we are having to move quickly to catch up with our global peers in this respect, the lag in digital adoption in Africa provides a window of opportunity to entrench our leadership in our markets. Rising to this challenge requires that we attract talent with the necessary digital and IT skills, and retrain our employees across all levels of the organisation to ensure our people have the skills required to engage with and use new digital and IT platforms.

Our entrepreneurial beginnings had left us with a legacy of decentralised IT solutions and initiatives not suited to our scale and progress to the ‘One Imperial’ business model, culture and brand. This, in combination with the accelerating adoption of digital capabilities and related escalation in expectations of key stakeholders, highlighted the need for a unifying and centre-led digital strategy. In turn, this needed a cohesive IT architecture and standardised processes, to enable digital optimisation and innovation across the group.

Over the past year, we have made significant progress on implementing our digital and IT strategy. We have established our centre-led digital and IT capability and structure, made key appointments, worked hard to develop enterprise architecture roadmaps for our business units and our work on enterprise architecture will stand us in good stead as we begin to standardise our digital platforms. Excellent progress has been made in establishing a base for data-driven decision making through our business performance insights platform. Acquiring Parcel Ninja has fundamentally shifted perceptions of digital and IT at Imperial. We have also made strides in progressing our digital fleet management capabilities and made significant investments in our digital commerce capabilities.

Investing in digital and IT

Digital and technology transformations carry upfront costs and require significant investment in the short term, to achieve benefits that only return value in the medium and long term. Over the past year, we have allocated significant capital to our digital and IT initiatives.

Digital outcomes

Systems and platforms that enable our people and clients while supporting growth, cost optimisation, value for money and performance.

Digital and data capabilities designed to support Imperial’s strategy and purpose: connecting Africa and the world and improving people’s lives with access to quality products and services.

Our digital and IT strategy

Our strategy is key to transforming Imperial, enabling growth and achieving our strategy by providing coherent system architecture and processes that support core business and strategic delivery, and by facilitating access to new value propositions and revenue streams. Ultimately, our digital strategy should enable us to build partnerships across our ecosystem, and identify, pre-empt, integrate and own potentially disruptive technologies and businesses. Our digital strategy is both a driver of and facilitated by our ‘One Imperial’ and ‘Gateway to Africa’ strategy; a unifying digital strategy is not possible without an integrated and unified approach to the business, and our ability to truly become ‘One Imperial’ cannot be fulfilled without foundational IT processes and initiatives in place. Our digital initiatives and imperatives are similarly foundational to our ability to capture new opportunities, amplify value, differentiate, meet and anticipate our clients’ needs, and to lead in innovation.

Our digital and IT strategic goal is to use best-in-class and emerging technology to improve efficiency, facilitate revenue growth and create new revenue streams by focusing on:

Leveraging our digital capabilities in e-commerce fulfilment, control towers, value from data and digital disruptors, to gain a commercial competitive advantage. Using data insights to drive improved decision making across the business. Enabling the ‘One Imperial’ transformation via digital engagement initiatives that support communication and HR best practice. Developing our enterprise architecture to enable process simplification, standardisation and digitisation according to our enterprise architecture roadmaps, in collaboration with business and group functions. Enhancing the ways we do business, prioritising: Service management (including our customers and partners).

Cost and value (including transparency and business cases).

Talent management (including diversity and inclusion).

We measure our progress through our strategic KPIs

Enterprise architecture Clarify digital context and define journey. Establish digital capabilities Develop digital and IT initiatives. Acquire e-commerce capabilities Complete acquisition and leverage capabilities. Investments and partnerships Progress investment in innovation and apply learnings. Digital and IT organisation Define organisational strategy and implement.

This strategy is being translated into future enterprise architecture along the following purpose-driven framework:

Digital and IT initiatives enabling ‘One Imperial’

Internal <> External value

Digital and IT structure

A unifying digital strategy necessitated a shift in the way that we operate within the business and the creation of a centre-led digital and IT engagement model. In the past year, we have appointed a digital and IT leadership team to oversee and co-ordinate the implementation of our strategy and undergone a deep organisational design process with the aim of positioning digital and IT to enable the group’s functions to support business and enable the group’s businesses to serve their external clients, principals and customers. As part our organisational design, the digital and IT executive committee members have identified a set of focus areas and related changes required to deliver on our strategy and accelerate digital enablement within the group.

People and change Activate and transition to the new Digital & IT organisational structure.

Effectively manage change and communications related to implementing the new digital and IT model. Business and

functional IT Establish an effective business partnering link with relevant executives.

Consolidate and standardise systems and teams into business capability-oriented teams. Digital products Elevate data and insight into an industrialised capability underpinning all our businesses.

Ideate, incubate and scale a set of ‘One Imperial’ digital products.

Consolidate and further mature our delivery capabilities. IT services and security Integrate local support structures into one support structure with local nodes.

Consolidate and modernise infrastructure and platforms into a scalable foundation.

Embed an end-to-end cyber security approach across Imperial.

Bolster licence, asset and performance management for improved control. Strategy and

architecture Establish the ‘One Imperial’ architecture direction and enabling governance.

Manage our ‘One Imperial’ project portfolio with appropriate and enabling governance.

Create visibility in cost and value within digital and IT.

We also identified functional goals for the 2021 financial year, against which we track our progress.

We have completed our first succession planning process; this should facilitate increased diversity at upper management and leadership levels, while also providing various succession alternatives, ensuring long-term viability of our digital strategy and initiatives.

Defined and communicated our focus areas. Completed our strategy to structure process. Completed inventory for our enterprise architecture and defined our conceptual framework and platform strategy. Continue to accelerate our digital capabilities. Conceptualised our engagement model and translated it into organisational design. Agreed the principles of our commercial consequence and translated this into budget guidelines. Established our data lake, replicated commercial and financial reporting in the user interface and performed extensive data science for digital fleet management to establish our business performance insights platform (BPI-P).

Key initiatives

Our business performance insights platform

During the 2021 financial year, we partnered with experts in data-based decision making to begin developing our BPI-P, a fully integrated and centralised reporting platform that, when fully implemented, will enable improved data-led decision making and reduce risk. The platform is designed to provide a solution for handling big data across the group, with the aim of deriving value from data and generating and evaluating business performance insights.

The BPI-P is a relatively new development and is being tailored to meet the needs of key internal stakeholders. These are currently grouped into three insights categories as well as digital fleet management below, each of which addresses specific stakeholder and business needs.

Commercial insights Our commercial reporting capability is well established and was one of the first business elements migrated to the BPI-P. We use these insights to increase client satisfaction, optimise margins, improve pipeline conversion, increase productivity and to focus on 100% contract renewals. Business insights These aim to combine data and analysis to increase our understanding of our actual performance across business continuums, drive strategy and increase our competitive advantage. The insights provide a deeper understanding of major mechanics related to our business, allowing us to identify why an event affecting performance occurs. In consultation with Market Access and Logistics, we have identified a list of KPIs to be used as the initial base for BPI-P reporting dashboards. Finance insights By exporting our financial management data into BPI, we will be able to develop business reports and enable near real-time reporting of key financial metrics and data including standardised and historical data, comparative and actual budgets, and forecast trending over months and years.

Enterprise architecture

Enterprise architecture forms a key element of improving the group’s performance; this will allow us to develop a holistic and integrated view of our strategic direction, business practices, information flows and technology resources. By developing current and future versions of this integrated view, we will manage the transition from current to future operating states across five domains:

Business architecture Organisational structure and the functional capabilities needed to deliver the vision.

Application architecture Individual applications, their interactions and their relationships to core business processes. Data architecture The structure of our logical and physical data assets and data management resources. Technology architecture Software and hardware needed to implement our business, data and application services. Security architecture The structure and behaviour for our security processes and information security systems.

To progress our work on enterprise architecture, we have:

Completed enterprise architecture roadmaps for the majority of our business units.

Established a business architecture framework identifying key business capabilities that currently exist within Imperial and identified capabilities that are needed to deliver on strategy.

Developed application roadmaps and implementation timelines for each business.

Developed a data insights strategy that focuses on people, processes and technology.

Established an architectural review committee to ensure good governance.

Digital engagement

In collaboration with corporate affairs and investor relations, we have engaged with a global digital strategy and technology partner to assist us in gaining a deeper understanding of user journeys, and of how to best support digital engagement for internal and external stakeholders. The process is designed to ensure we select the appropriate technologies to elevate and advance digital engagement among our key stakeholder groups.

For more on the group’s approach to change management, Our people.

Our structured value-focused initiatives

We continue to provide principals and clients with best-in-class and complete solutions, to access their end-consumers through an integrated sourcing, logistics and sales service. Our strategic digital and data initiatives are aligned with our focus areas and designed to deliver growth.

Key initiative: Parcel Ninja acquisition We acquired and are fully integrating Parcel Ninja, a specialised warehousing and distribution management business, which represents a fundamental shift in our digitalisation journey. With its leading software, processes and people capabilities in South Africa, Parcel Ninja provides fulfilment in both B2C and B2B channels including the informal market, supported by the management and optimisation of courier parcel deliveries. This acquisition supports Imperial’s strategic ambition to accelerate our digital capabilities and expand our logistics and market access into last mile distribution and e-commerce fulfilment, and to grow our footprint and scale in Africa, while ensuring that our clients and principals remain locally relevant. We are currently exploring collaboration opportunities with Parcel Ninja, including supporting Market Access with solutions for the South African market, warehouse and order management convergence and supporting direct-to-consumer logistics solutions.

Key initiative: Project Blue Fleet We have begun rolling out Project Blue Feet, a digital fleet management initiative that will allow us to transform our South African operations into a more agile business by integrating insights in our South African road freight and contract logistics fleets. The core objective for this initiative is reducing costs while realising fuel and overtime savings in the short term as well as other vehicle-related cost savings like insurance and tyre spend over time. Significant business engagements were undertaken to understand the business requirements and processes, as well as to ensure that we adequately communicated progress appropriately with the teams to effectively manage our change management requirements. Our current focus is on recording data and validating activity while also managing processes across the business with increasing accuracy, maturity and scope. We have set clearly defined performance baselines, enabling us to accurately measure and evaluate performance with minimal influence from non-controllable factors. We now understand the specific actions we must take to consistently improve our performance and proactively identify new opportunities to reduce waste and realise cost savings. Overall alignment to group and Imperial Logistics

South Africa (ILSA) objectives to be achieved Core initial focus of Project Blue Fleet is the South African

road freight businesses, with complimentary focus on

distribution fleets within contract logistics

Innovation Venture Fund

Our disruptive innovation fund, in partnership with Newtown Partners, makes available an initial capital investment of USD20 million to provide a mechanism to invest in innovative developments. We refined our investment principles and focus areas to fund high-potential start-ups in freight logistics, supply chain management and healthtech that use emerging technologies and disruptive business models to drive value.

We are actively managing nine portfolio companies, namely:

Cheefa, an assetlight e-pharmacy marketplace that creates a distribution channel to end consumer in Egypt and Saudi Arabia. Clockwork Logistics, a B2B provider of

a highly configurable delivery platform

and driver application. MDaaS Global,

a healthtech

company, building

road freight exchange

operating in East and

West Africa. Fulfilment Bridge,

a cross-border

digital logistics

service provider,

serving e-commerce

merchants in the

Middle East and

North Africa.

Each of these minority investments have a time-to-value of five to seven years and were selected on the basis that they have capabilities that may become strategically relevant to Imperial at that time and at commercial scale. These start-ups are positioned to grow rapidly in their home markets before leveraging their disruptive competitive advantages to enter new geographical markets and service areas; they have the potential to reorganise value chains, address new customer segments more effectively than before, and to displace incumbents in the process. As they scale, some of these start-ups will be increasingly integrated into Imperial’s value chain, where they will help us to disrupt existing markets and enhance the competitiveness of our value proposition to clients.

Investing in innovative technology, relevant to our business and aligned to our strategy, will allow us to mitigate the risk of disruption, positioning the group at the forefront of innovation and allowing us to capitalise on the ongoing evolution of technology.

Our pragmatic approach to investing in innovation will support the strategic alignment of our investments as we continue to investigate new investment opportunities and partnerships. Our pipeline includes a range of opportunities, earmarked for due diligence research that will inform the granting of an investment mandate. The fund has the capacity to make four further investments and will continue to critically assess any opportunities to ensure that these are strategically aligned as well as being commercially viable.

Outlook

We have a clearly articulated and defined digital and IT strategy. We are finalising our medium-term plan and value case, which will be supported by implementing the enterprise architecture roadmaps that inform our investment requirements. Our newly established centre-led digital and IT structure will support the delivery of the plan, with the necessary governance and oversight structures and procedures in place.

Shareholder report: corporate governance report available online.

Having made key appointments in the year, we will continue to assess our resourcing requirements and deepen our digital and IT capabilities over time.

Going forward, we will continue to allocate adequate investment to the systems and skills, and the change management support, to enable Imperial’s growth aspirations and to generate valuable insights from our data assets; to support business and functions, facilitate access to new value propositions and revenue streams and mitigate the risk of disruption.",logistics industry tech disruptors

Disruptive innovation,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation,N/A,"Technological change

An 1880 penny-farthing (left), and a 1886 Rover safety bicycle with gearing

In business theory, disruptive innovation is innovation that creates a new market and value network or enters at the bottom of an existing market and eventually displaces established market-leading firms, products, and alliances.[1] The term, ""disruptive innovation"" was popularized by the American academic Clayton Christensen and his collaborators beginning in 1995,[2] but the concept had been previously described in Richard N. Foster's book ""Innovation: The Attacker's Advantage"" and in the paper Strategic Responses to Technological Threats.[3]

Not all innovations are disruptive, even if they are revolutionary. For example, the first automobiles in the late 19th century were not a disruptive innovation, because early automobiles were expensive luxury items that did not disrupt the market for horse-drawn vehicles. The market for transportation essentially remained intact until the debut of the lower-priced Ford Model T in 1908. The mass-produced automobile was a disruptive innovation, because it changed the transportation market, whereas the first thirty years of automobiles did not.

Disruptive innovations tend to be produced by outsiders and entrepreneurs in startups, rather than existing market-leading companies. The business environment of market leaders does not allow them to pursue disruptive innovations when they first arise, because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from sustaining innovations (which are needed to compete against current competition). Small teams are more likely to create disruptive innovations than large teams.[6] A disruptive process can take longer to develop than by the conventional approach and the risk associated to it is higher than the other more incremental, architectural or evolutionary forms of innovations, but once it is deployed in the market, it achieves a much faster penetration and higher degree of impact on the established markets.[7]

Beyond business and economics disruptive innovations can also be considered to disrupt complex systems, including economic and business-related aspects.[8] Through identifying and analyzing systems for possible points of intervention, one can then design changes focused on disruptive interventions.[9]

Usage history [ edit ]

Christensen's Types of Innovation[10] Sustaining An innovation that does not significantly affect existing markets. It may be either: Evolutionary An innovation that improves a product in an existing market in ways that customers are expecting (e.g., fuel injection for gasoline engines, which displaced carburetors.) Revolutionary (discontinuous but sustaining) An innovation that is unexpected, but nevertheless does not affect existing markets (e.g., the first automobiles in the late 19th century, which were expensive luxury items, and as such very few were sold) Disruptive An innovation that creates a new market or enters at the bottom of an existing market by providing a different set of values, which ultimately (and unexpectedly) overtakes incumbents (e.g., the lower-priced, affordable Ford Model T, which displaced horse-drawn carriages)

The term disruptive technologies was coined by Clayton M. Christensen and introduced in his 1995 article Disruptive Technologies: Catching the Wave,[11] which he cowrote with Joseph Bower. The article is aimed at both management executives who make the funding or purchasing decisions in companies, as well as the research community, which is largely responsible for introducing the disruptive vector to the consumer market. He describes the term further in his book The Innovator's Dilemma. Innovator's Dilemma explored the case of the disk drive industry (the disk drive and memory industry, with its rapid technological evolution, is to the study of technology what fruit flies are to the study of genetics, as Christensen was told in the 1990s ) and the excavating and Earth-moving industry (where hydraulic actuation slowly, yet eventually, displaced cable-actuated machinery). In his sequel with Michael E. Raynor, The Innovator's Solution, Christensen replaced the term disruptive technology with disruptive innovation because he recognized that most technologies are not intrinsically disruptive or sustaining in character; rather, it is the business model that identifies the crucial idea that potentiates profound market success and subsequently serves as the disruptive vector. Comprehending Christensen's business model, which takes the disruptive vector from the idea borne from the mind of the innovator to a marketable product, is central to understanding how novel technology facilitates the rapid destruction of established technologies and markets by the disruptor. Christensen and Mark W. Johnson, who cofounded the management consulting firm Innosight, described the dynamics of ""business model innovation"" in the 2008 Harvard Business Review article ""Reinventing Your Business Model"".[15] The concept of disruptive technology continues a long tradition of identifying radical technological change in the study of innovation by economists, and its implementation and execution by its management at a corporate or policy level.[16]

According to Christensen, ""the term 'disruptive innovation' is misleading when it is used to refer to the derivative, or 'instantaneous value', of the market behavior of the product or service, rather than the integral, or 'sum over histories', of the product's market behavior.""[17]

In the late 1990s, the automotive sector began to embrace a perspective of ""constructive disruptive technology"" by working with the consultant David E. O'Ryan, whereby the use of current off-the-shelf technology was integrated with newer innovation to create what he called ""an unfair advantage"". The process or technology change as a whole had to be ""constructive"" in improving the current method of manufacturing, yet disruptively impact the whole of the business case model, resulting in a significant reduction of waste, energy, materials, labor, or legacy costs to the user.

In keeping with the insight that a persuasive advertising campaign can be just as effective as technological sophistication at bringing a successful product to market, Christensen's theory explains why many disruptive innovations are not advanced or useful technologies, rather combinations of existing off-the-shelf components, applied shrewdly to a fledgling value network.

Online news site TechRepublic proposes an end using the term, and similar related terms, suggesting that, as of 2014, it is overused jargon.[18]

Definition [ edit ]

Disruption is a process, not a product or service, that occurs from the nascent to the mainstream

Originates in low-end (less demanding customers) or new market (where none existed) footholds

New firms don't catch on with mainstream customers until quality catches up with their standards

Success is not a requirement and some business can be disruptive but fail

New firm's business model differs significantly from incumbent[17]

Christensen continues to develop and refine the theory and has accepted that not all examples of disruptive innovation perfectly fit into his theory. For example, he conceded that originating in the low end of the market is not always a cause of disruptive innovation, but rather it fosters competitive business models, using Uber as an example. In an interview with Forbes magazine he stated:

""Uber helped me realize that it isn’t that being at the bottom of the market is the causal mechanism, but that it’s correlated with a business model that is unattractive to its competitor"".[19]

Entrepreneur Chris Dixon cited the theory for the idea that ""the next big thing always starts out being dismissed as a 'toy'.""[20]

Theory [ edit ]

The current theoretical understanding of disruptive innovation is different from what might be expected by default, an idea that Clayton M. Christensen called the ""technology mudslide hypothesis"". This is the simplistic idea that an established firm fails because it doesn't ""keep up technologically"" with other firms. In this hypothesis, firms are like climbers scrambling upward on crumbling footing, where it takes constant upward-climbing effort just to stay still, and any break from the effort (such as complacency born of profitability) causes a rapid downhill slide. Christensen and colleagues have shown that this simplistic hypothesis is wrong; it doesn't model reality. What they have shown is that good firms are usually aware of the innovations, but their business environment does not allow them to pursue them when they first arise, because they are not profitable enough at first and because their development can take scarce resources away from that of sustaining innovations (which are needed to compete against current competition). In Christensen's terms, a firm's existing value networks place insufficient value on the disruptive innovation to allow its pursuit by that firm. Meanwhile, start-up firms inhabit different value networks, at least until the day that their disruptive innovation is able to invade the older value network. At that time, the established firm in that network can at best only fend off the market share attack with a me-too entry, for which survival (not thriving) is the only reward.

In the technology mudslide hypothesis, Christensen differentiated disruptive innovation from sustaining innovation. He explained that the latter's goal is to improve existing product performance.[21] On the other hand, he defines a disruptive innovation as a product or service designed for a new set of customers.

Generally, disruptive innovations were technologically straightforward, consisting of off-the-shelf components put together in a product architecture that was often simpler than prior approaches. They offered less of what customers in established markets wanted and so could rarely be initially employed there. They offered a different package of attributes valued only in emerging markets remote from, and unimportant to, the mainstream.

Christensen also noted that products considered as disruptive innovations tend to skip stages in the traditional product design and development process to quickly gain market traction and competitive advantage.[23] He argued that disruptive innovations can hurt successful, well-managed companies that are responsive to their customers and have excellent research and development. These companies tend to ignore the markets most susceptible to disruptive innovations, because the markets have very tight profit margins and are too small to provide a good growth rate to an established (sizable) firm. Thus, disruptive technology provides an example of an instance when the common business-world advice to ""focus on the customer"" (or ""stay close to the customer"", or ""listen to the customer"") can be strategically counterproductive.

While Christensen argued that disruptive innovations can hurt successful, well-managed companies, O'Ryan countered that ""constructive"" integration of existing, new, and forward-thinking innovation could improve the economic benefits of these same well-managed companies, once decision-making management understood the systemic benefits as a whole.

How low-end disruption occurs over time[ clarification needed ]

Christensen distinguishes between ""low-end disruption"", which targets customers who do not need the full performance valued by customers at the high end of the market, and ""new-market disruption"", which targets customers who have needs that were previously unserved by existing incumbents.

Low-end disruption [ edit ]

""Low-end disruption"" occurs when the rate at which products improve exceeds the rate at which customers can adopt the new performance. Therefore, at some point the performance of the product overshoots the needs of certain customer segments. At this point, a disruptive technology may enter the market and provide a product that has lower performance than the incumbent but that exceeds the requirements of certain segments, thereby gaining a foothold in the market.

In low-end disruption, the disruptor is focused initially on serving the least profitable customer, who is happy with a good enough product. This type of customer is not willing to pay premium for enhancements in product functionality. Once the disruptor has gained a foothold in this customer segment, it seeks to improve its profit margin. To get higher profit margins, the disruptor needs to enter the segment where the customer is willing to pay a little more for higher quality. To ensure this quality in its product, the disruptor needs to innovate. The incumbent will not do much to retain its share in a not-so-profitable segment, and will move up-market and focus on its more attractive customers. After a number of such encounters, the incumbent is squeezed into smaller markets than it was previously serving. And then, finally, the disruptive technology meets the demands of the most profitable segment and drives the established company out of the market.

New market disruption [ edit ]

""New market disruption"" occurs when a product fits a new or emerging market segment that is not being served by existing incumbents in the industry. Some scholars note that the creation of a new market is a defining feature of disruptive innovation, particularly in the way it tend to improve products or services differently in comparison to normal market drivers.[26] It initially caters to a niche market and proceeds on defining the industry over time once it is able to penetrate the market or induce consumers to defect from the existing market into the new market it created.[26]

Critics [ edit ]

The extrapolation of the theory to all aspects of life has been challenged,[27][28] as has the methodology of relying on selected case studies as the principal form of evidence.[27] Jill Lepore points out that some companies identified by the theory as victims of disruption a decade or more ago, rather than being defunct, remain dominant in their industries today (including Seagate Technology, U.S. Steel, and Bucyrus).[27] Lepore questions whether the theory has been oversold and misapplied, as if it were able to explain everything in every sphere of life, including not just business but education and public institutions.[27] W.Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne, the authors of Blue Ocean Strategy, also published a book in 2023, Beyond Disruption, criticizing disruptive innovation for the social costs it tends to incur.[29]

Disruptive technology [ edit ]

In 2009, Milan Zeleny described high technology as disruptive technology and raised the question of what is being disrupted. The answer, according to Zeleny, is the support network of high technology.[30] For example, introducing electric cars disrupts the support network for gasoline cars (network of gas and service stations). Such disruption is fully expected and therefore effectively resisted by support net owners. In the long run, high (disruptive) technology bypasses, upgrades, or replaces the outdated support network.

Questioning the concept of a disruptive technology, Haxell (2012) questions how such technologies get named and framed, pointing out that this is a positioned and retrospective act.[31][32]

Technology, being a form of social relationship,[33] always evolves. No technology remains fixed. Technology starts, develops, persists, mutates, stagnates, and declines, just like living organisms.[34] The evolutionary life cycle occurs in the use and development of any technology. A new high-technology core emerges and challenges existing technology support nets (TSNs), which are thus forced to coevolve with it. New versions of the core are designed and fitted into an increasingly appropriate TSN, with smaller and smaller high-technology effects. High technology becomes regular technology, with more efficient versions fitting the same support net. Finally, even the efficiency gains diminish, emphasis shifts to product tertiary attributes (appearance, style), and technology becomes TSN-preserving appropriate technology. This technological equilibrium state becomes established and fixated, resisting being interrupted by a technological mutation; then new high technology appears and the cycle is repeated.

Regarding this evolving process of technology, Christensen said:

The technological changes that damage established companies are usually not radically new or difficult from a technological point of view. They do, however, have two important characteristics: First, they typically present a different package of performance attributes—ones that, at least at the outset, are not valued by existing customers. Second, the performance attributes that existing customers do value improve at such a rapid rate that the new technology can later invade those established markets.[35]

The World Bank's 2019 World Development Report on The Changing Nature of Work[36] examines how technology shapes the relative demand for certain skills in labor markets and expands the reach of firms - robotics and digital technologies, for example, enable firms to automate, replacing labor with machines to become more efficient, and innovate, expanding the number of tasks and products. Joseph Bower[37] explained the process of how disruptive technology, through its requisite support net, dramatically transforms a certain industry.

When the technology that has the potential for revolutionizing an industry emerges, established companies typically see it as unattractive: it’s not something their mainstream customers want, and its projected profit margins aren’t sufficient to cover big-company cost structure. As a result, the new technology tends to get ignored in favor of what’s currently popular with the best customers. But then another company steps in to bring the innovation to a new market. Once the disruptive technology becomes established there, smaller-scale innovation rapidly raise the technology’s performance on attributes that mainstream customers’ value.[38]

For example, the automobile was high technology with respect to the horse carriage. It evolved into technology and finally into appropriate technology with a stable, unchanging TSN. The main high-technology advance in the offing is some form of electric car—whether the energy source is the sun, hydrogen, water, air pressure, or traditional charging outlet. Electric cars preceded the gasoline automobile by many decades and are now returning to replace the traditional gasoline automobile. The printing press was a development that changed the way that information was stored, transmitted, and replicated. This allowed empowered authors but it also promoted censorship and information overload in writing technology.

Milan Zeleny described the above phenomenon.[39] He also wrote that:

Implementing high technology is often resisted. This resistance is well understood on the part of active participants in the requisite TSN. The electric car will be resisted by gas-station operators in the same way automated teller machines (ATMs) were resisted by bank tellers and automobiles by horsewhip makers. Technology does not qualitatively restructure the TSN and therefore will not be resisted and never has been resisted. Middle management resists business process reengineering because BPR represents a direct assault on the support net (coordinative hierarchy) they thrive on. Teamwork and multi-functionality is resisted by those whose TSN provides the comfort of narrow specialization and command-driven work.[40]

Social media could be considered a disruptive innovation within sports. More specifically, the way that news in sports circulates nowadays versus the pre-internet era where sports news was mainly on TV, radio and newspapers. Social media has created a new market for sports that was not around before in the sense that players and fans have instant access to information related to sports.

High-technology effects [ edit ]

High technology is a technology core that changes the very architecture (structure and organization) of the components of the technology support net. High technology therefore transforms the qualitative nature of the TSN's tasks and their relations, as well as their requisite physical, energy, and information flows. It also affects the skills required, the roles played, and the styles of management and coordination—the organizational culture itself.

This kind of technology core is different from regular technology core, which preserves the qualitative nature of flows and the structure of the support and only allows users to perform the same tasks in the same way, but faster, more reliably, in larger quantities, or more efficiently. It is also different from appropriate technology core, which preserves the TSN itself with the purpose of technology implementation and allows users to do the same thing in the same way at comparable levels of efficiency, instead of improving the efficiency of performance.[41]

On differences between high and low technologies, Milan Zeleny wrote:

The effects of high technology always breaks the direct comparability by changing the system itself, therefore requiring new measures and new assessments of its productivity. High technology cannot be compared and evaluated with the existing technology purely on the basis of cost, net present value or return on investment. Only within an unchanging and relatively stable TSN would such direct financial comparability be meaningful. For example, you can directly compare a manual typewriter with an electric typewriter, but not a typewriter with a word processor. Therein lies the management challenge of high technology.[42]

Not all modern technologies are high technologies, only those used and functioning as such, and embedded in their requisite TSNs. They have to empower the individual because only through the individual can they empower knowledge. Not all information technologies have integrative effects. Some information systems are still designed to improve the traditional hierarchy of command and thus preserve and entrench the existing TSN. The administrative model of management, for instance, further aggravates the division of task and labor, further specializes knowledge, separates management from workers, and concentrates information and knowledge in centers.

As knowledge surpasses capital, labor, and raw materials as the dominant economic resource, technologies are also starting to reflect this shift. Technologies are rapidly shifting from centralized hierarchies to distributed networks. Nowadays knowledge does not reside in a super-mind, super-book, or super-database, but in a complex relational pattern of networks brought forth to coordinate human action.

Proactive approach [ edit ]

A proactive approach to addressing the challenge posed by disruptive innovations has been debated by scholars.[43][44][45] Petzold criticized the lack of acknowledgment of underlying process of the change to study the disruptive innovation over time from a process view and complexify the concept to support the understanding of its unfolding and advance its manageability. Keeping in view the multidimensional nature of disruptive innovation a measurement framework has been developed by Guo to enable a systemic assessment of disruptive potential of innovations, providing insights for the decisions in product/service launch and resource allocation. Middle managers play an important role in long term sustainability of any firm and thus have been studied to have a proactive role in exploitation of the disruptive innovation process.[46][47]

Examples [ edit ]

In the practical world, the popularization of personal computers illustrates how knowledge contributes to the ongoing technology innovation. The original centralized concept (one computer, many persons) is a knowledge-defying idea of the prehistory of computing, and its inadequacies and failures have become clearly apparent. The era of personal computing brought powerful computers ""on every desk"" (one person, one computer). This short transitional period was necessary for getting used to the new computing environment, but was inadequate from the vantage point of producing knowledge. Adequate knowledge creation and management come mainly from networking and distributed computing (one person, many computers). Each person's computer must form an access point to the entire computing landscape or ecology through the Internet of other computers, databases, and mainframes, as well as production, distribution, and retailing facilities, and the like. For the first time, technology empowers individuals rather than external hierarchies. It transfers influence and power where it optimally belongs: at the loci of the useful knowledge. Even though hierarchies and bureaucracies do not innovate, free and empowered individuals do; knowledge, innovation, spontaneity, and self-reliance are becoming increasingly valued and promoted.[48]

Uber is not an example of disruption because it did not originate in a low-end or new market footholds.[17] One of the conditions for the business to be considered disruptive according to Clayton M. Christensen is that the business should originate on a) low-end or b) new-market footholds. Instead, Uber was launched in San Francisco, a large urban city with an established taxi service and did not target low-end customers or created a new market (from the consumer perspective). In contrast, UberSELECT, an option that provides luxurious cars such as limousine at a discounted price, is an example of disruption innovation because it originates from low-end customers segment - customers who would not have entered the traditional luxurious market.

"ASEAN Logistics Market—Disruptive Innovations, Forecast ...",https://store.frost.com/asean-logistics-market-disruptive-innovations-forecast-to-2025.html,N/A,"Description

By 2025, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) region is expected to be the next destination for global participants, replacing China, with its geographic proximity, large consumer base, and low costs attracting traders. Cambodia, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam (the CLMV countries of the Greater Mekong Subregion) are emerging as an attractive destination for investors. The ASEAN marked its 50th anniversary in 2017, striving to move forward as a single market and production base. Implementation of the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) will unify ASEAN members under a single cluster, making it an attractive hub for investors. An integrated transport and mobility infrastructure in the region offers a new dimension for the growth of the ASEAN. Trade activities are expected to record tangible advances with the support of participating governments. A growing consumer base, due to urbanization in ASEAN and enhanced by digital penetration, drives online business model adoption by industry players, encouraging the integration of both local and international logistics providers. The top 10 disruptive trends identified in the field of logistics in the region are expected to enhance ASEAN’s position as an international leading business hub. The innovative trends are expected to be interrelated, boosting the growth of the logistics industry in ASEAN. Significant growth is forecast in the logistics industry across ASEAN during the next decade driven by the logistics trends.



Development of a logistics master plan in ASEAN countries is becoming a key requirement for the countries’ initiatives to facilitate a Strategic Transport Plan at a regional level as a part of ASEAN Economic Community (AEC) integration. The transport plan and frameworks enhance the growth of cross-border logistics, enabling seamless connectivity and creating opportunities for goods offering effective trade facilitation to stakeholders. This will be further enhanced by the adoption of technology solutions such as eCommerce and app-based crowdsourced logistics platforms, leading the supply chain activities from insourcing to outsourcing, rail and freight transportation. Rising urbanization and uberization trends also boost the growth of start-up companies as part of the supply chain model in ASEAN.



Blockchain is a global trend that has influenced ASEAN’s supply chain management. The rise of blockchain in ASEAN is expected to facilitate logistics management and accelerate trade growth along with the support of rapid adoption of digital technology by stakeholders in the region. The logistics industry in ASEAN is forecast to be more agile and anticipatory by 2025, allowing service providers to address the rising demand with cost- and time-effective solutions.",logistics industry tech disruptors

"Commuters open to autonomous bus shuttles, but some ...",https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/commuters-open-to-autonomous-bus-shuttles-but-some-worry-about-the-human-cost/,2 дня назад,"Autonomous vehicles could change how people commute and ease traffic congestion, but riders think the technology and approach could still use some work.

Margie Gonzalez is hopping onto an autonomous shuttle for the first time.

""It's pretty nice, a comfy ride,"" said Gonzalez.

Launched last year by the Contra Costa County Transportation Agency, Presto, with its two shuttles, moves along a fixed-route across Bishop Ranch, a 600-acre business hub in San Ramon.

Less than a minute into the ride, there's an abrupt stop.

The agency acknowledges there's a gap between where AV technology is now, and the future of autonomous transportation.

Long -time bus driver Tony Hayes is much more skeptical.

""We used to go to tellers; now, it's just ATMs. I just don't trust it,"" said Hayes.

He's been in countless situations, in which children and others have asked him for help.

""You want to be able to pull a bus over and ask, 'Do you need some help?' A bus is not going to do that by itself,"" said Hayes.

Addressing those concerns is key for the industry and those who see its promise to improve transportation.

Tim Haile is executive director of the Contra Costa Transportation Authority.

""We have a first and last mile problem in Contra Costa County,"" said Haile.

According to CCTA, nearly half of the trips within the county are less than two miles.

The agency's long-term vision is an automated shuttle service between homes and transportation hubs like BART and bus stations, eliminating the need to drive and park for a connecting route to the city.

""If we really address the first and last mile transportation gap or challenge, we can reduce a lot of our congestion here in Contra Costa County,"" said Haile.

To move in that direction, the agency this summer will provide a similar shuttle service like the one at Bishop Ranch.

It will transport nearby patients to the Contra Costa Regional Medical Center in Martinez.

Riders like Gonzalez are open to embracing a different way of commuting but think the technology and approach still needs some work.

""If it were free, I would definitely consider it other days that I might need to have my vehicle for other things,"" said Gonzalez.

Contra Costa will also launch another service this summer with two autonomous shuttles in the gated retirement community of Rossmoor in Walnut Creek.

They will transport senior residents to the community hub that includes a fitness center on its campus.",logistics industry tech disruptors
10 North West startups pitch today to reach national final,https://businesscloud.co.uk/news/10-north-west-startups-pitch-today-to-reach-national-final/,17 часов назад,"Ten scaleup businesses from across the North West have been shortlisted from nearly 400 applications to pitch their businesses to a panel of industry experts in the search for the UK’s next big tech disruptor.

KPMG’s annual competition which showcases tech innovators from eight regions across the UK has been running since 2013, and uncovered outstanding tech from businesses including What3Words, Inovus Medical and HiiROC who went on to win the global final during Web Summit in 2022.

The businesses from the North West have been selected from almost 400 applications to pitch against each other to find one innovator who will represent the region at the UK finals in London in July.

Today these startups will pitch, with one crowned KPMG’s North West regional Tech Innovator in the UK winner: ABS (Morecombe), Drill Surgeries (Liverpool), LiNa Energy (Lancaster), Graphene Innovations Manchester, Rezzil (Manchester), Nanoplexus (Manchester), UrbanChain (Manchester), Zally (Manchester), Lemon (Manchester) and Grafmarine (Altrincham).

Chris Stott, office senior partner for KPMG in Manchester, said: “Our shortlisted businesses represent some of the best tech innovation in the country and it’s great to see these 10 fantastic local businesses in the running.

“They will be competing to represent our region in the UK final, so I wish them the best of luck in going all the way, hopefully following in the footsteps of St Helens-based Inovus Medical, who won last year’s national competition.

“The UK technology sector attracts investment from across the world and we have some incredible businesses right here on our doorstep who could be the next tech titan. Our aim with this competition is to uncover these businesses and shine a light on their technologies and how they are disrupting the market.

“We are looking forward to seeing the pitches from those shortlisted and meeting the founders who are hoping to be crowned as KPMG’s next Tech Innovator in the UK winner.”

Mark Lyons, investment director at Puma Private Equity, said: “I am very much looking forward to hearing the stories of the ten businesses that have made it to the shortlist and excited to meet the founders and their teams.

“Our winner needs to be able to tell the story of their business in a passionate way, but most importantly, they need to demonstrate how their technology is solving a problem and has the potential to grow into a successful business.”

The winners of each regional stage will then go on to the national final to be held in London in July. The overall winner will then go on to represent the UK at the global final, which takes place alongside Web Summit later in the year – where a panel of global judges will crown the 2024 KPMG Private Enterprise Global Tech Innovator.",logistics industry tech disruptors

Streamlining Your Supply Chain With Warehouse Automation,https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2022/sep/warehouse-automation.html,N/A,"The biggest challenge now facing warehouse operations is that many of these hardware and software solutions are in effect “islands” – and there is no easy way to connect these islands to create a system that is fully autonomous. This is true especially for warehouses where the automation system has evolved over time, a situation more typical than not in most companies. The legacy of piecemeal acquisition ensures that it will inevitably be a major struggle to connect the patchwork of hardware, software, and IT-architecture solutions. This is a challenge full automation has to tackle. Thereby, it is of paramount importance for companies to develop digital supply chain capabilities, where not only the right hard- and software is required but also the right people and an organization that is capable of implementing and maintaining this setup.",supply chain automation startups
What Is Supply Chain Analytics?,https://www.ibm.com/topics/supply-chain-analytics,N/A,"In the past, supply chain analytics was limited mostly to statistical analysis and quantifiable performance indicators for demand planning and forecasting. Data was stored in spreadsheets that came from different participants within the supply chain.

By the 1990s, companies were adopting electronic data interchange (EDI) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems to connect and exchange information among supply chain partners. These systems provided easier access to data for analysis, along with assisting businesses in their designing, planning and forecasting.

In the 2000s, businesses began turning to business intelligence and predictive analytic software solutions. These solutions helped companies gain a more in-depth knowledge of how their supply chain networks were performing, how to make better decisions and how to optimize their networks.

The challenge today concerns how companies can best use the huge amounts of data generated in their supply chain networks. As recently as 2017, a typical supply chain accessed 50 times more data than just five years earlier.¹ However, less than a quarter of this data was being analyzed. Further, while approximately 20% of all supply chain data is structured and can be easily analyzed, 80% of supply chain data is unstructured or dark data.² Today’s organizations are looking for ways to best analyze this dark data.

Studies are pointing to cognitive technologies or artificial intelligence as the next frontier in supply chain analytics. AI solutions go beyond information retention and process automation. AI software can think, reason and learn in a human-like manner. AI can also process tremendous amounts of data and information—both structured and unstructured data—and provide summaries and analyses of that information in an instant.

IDC estimated that by 2020, 50% of all business software would incorporate some cognitive computing functions.³ AI not only provides a platform for powerfully correlating and interpreting data from across systems and sources—it also allows organizations to analyze supply chain data and intelligence in real-time. Coupled with emerging blockchain technologies, companies in the future will be able to proactively forecast and predict events.",supply chain automation startups
"What Is Supply Chain Digitization, and Why Does It Matter?",https://www.ddcfpo.com/business-process-insights/what-is-supply-chain-digitization-and-why-does-it-matter,N/A,"With mature tools available in the marketplace, digital transformation is no longer about first-mover advantage; it's industry standard.

Digitizing your supply chain is vital for both streamlining your business processes and staying competitive — and it’s not as daunting as you may think.

But before we dig into how and why you should optimize, a brief primer:

What is supply chain digitization?

Supply chain digitization (or supply chain digital transformation) is the process of turning analog supply chain processes into digital ones by establishing dedicated master data that aggregates information from across your entire supply chain, as well as information from some external sources (e.g. internal historical sales data, point-of-sale consumer data, socioeconomic data such as unemployment rates, and external data such as Google trends or competitor prices).

Supply chain digitization is achieved primarily with software — whether it’s out-of-the-box, custom-made, or a combination of both — focusing on automation and business intelligence.

In this post, we'll discuss the advantages of a digitally enabled supply chain and explore how companies in the transportation and logistics industry can begin their digitization journeys (or optimize their current systems).

Advantages of a digital supply chain

Supply chain digitization can have a profound impact on your bottom line, and it’s central to the success of businesses in many different industries. More than 85% of C-level executives anticipate that digitization efforts will enhance cash flow and reduce Days Sales Outstanding.

Conversely, the cost of not digitizing is steep — on average, the yearly cost of manually entering data into ERP and back-end systems is more than $1 million, and the average annual cost of manually entering invoices from suppliers is more than $600,000.

The digitization of logistics presents a powerful opportunity to transform your business. Advantages of a digital supply chain include:

Opportunities for automation. Reducing manual tasks minimizes the burden of administrative work on your team, frees them up for other tasks that may have gone under-attended, and allows everyone to focus on their areas of expertise. Automating also reduces human error, which means gaining back revenue lost from fixing those errors. Automation also speeds up processes; for example, automated invoicing allows you to get paid faster.

Keeping things cohesive and connected. If you’re still relying on spreadsheets and email threads to get the information you need, you’ll get left behind. The immense time and effort spent on those tasks hurts efficiency and leaves more room for human error. Digitizing your supply chain creates opportunities for connecting disparate systems, enabling communication across the entire organization, and creating a single source of truth for information.

Leveraging data for decision-making. In the transportation and logistics industry, decisions need to be made quickly, and agility is vital. A digitized supply chain allows you to gather and analyze massive amounts of data with far less effort and in far less time than with analog systems. You can then use that knowledge to inform your decision-making, build strategies, and plan for any scenario. Incorporating real-time information that you’ve gleaned from your digitized supply chain can lead to big payoffs like improving the customer experience, boosting sales, and reducing waste.

How to digitize your supply chain management

There are two main options for digitizing your supply chain management: build or buy. Unfortunately, there are some issues with both options.

Identifying software that will seamlessly integrate with your existing systems out-of-the-box can be challenging. Additionally, ready-made solutions are not customized for your organization’s exact needs, and building custom plugins and integrations to make things work requires extra effort from your team (not to mention bug fixing and maintenance).

When it comes to building software in-house, the main challenge is capacity. Large-scale digitization is too big for many companies for existing development teams who have other important tasks at hand.

A better option is building custom solutions with IT outsourcing, which doesn’t require recruiting and allows your team to focus on keeping everyday operations running smoothly.

What to look for in an IT outsourcing partner

Teaming up with a business process outsourcing (BPO) partner that offers IT development services is one way to get the ball rolling. Here are a few essential qualities to look for:

Business continuity and strength as a partner amid uncertainty. Your IT outsourcing partner should feel like an extension of your team and instill confidence that they’ll keep you at the top of their priority list, no matter what challenges arise. They should provide ongoing support for your digitization efforts and help you maintain agility.

Service Level Agreements (SLAs) that have a highly positive impact on your business. As you negotiate SLAs, you’ll want to see them reflect increased visibility, high accuracy rates, robust and reliable data protection, impressive processing speed and service hours, and cost containment pricing. Your IT outsourcing solution should be tailored to your unique needs and produce actual results.

Strategic application of smart technology to streamline client processes. It should go without saying that your IT development partner should be well versed in the right technology and solutions for your business. They should know how to innovate wisely with various capabilities, including systems development, database development, and .NET programming.

An experienced team, dedicated to your success. A partner with at least 10 years of industry experience is a must. Don’t be afraid to vet an organization’s referrals and industry sources.

With the right BPO partner on your side, you can digitize your analog processes and create a more efficient supply chain — one that provides your organization with increased efficiency, agility, and revenue while also allowing your team to focus on everyday operations that keep your business growing.",supply chain automation startups

4 Ways to Add Value to Your Supply Chain,https://proconnectlogistics.com/blog/4-ways-to-add-value-to-your-supply-chain/,N/A,"Supply chain management is a process and not an end goal. The point of having a supply chain is to give your business benefits by making the process more efficient and fruitful. The challenge, however, is finding new ways to do this that won’t cost you time or money. After all, we can all agree that time and money are two things any business has too little of! Thankfully, there are plenty of ways you can add value to your supply chain without breaking the bank.

With so many businesses competing for customers and trying to stand out from the crowd with their products or services, it pays for companies to take a step back and ask what they can do to make their company even better.

Organizational Change

The first, and perhaps most fundamental way to add value to your supply chain is through organizational change. This could involve any significant alterations to your business operations, including those related to management, marketing or procurement. Organizational change is often needed when a company grows to a large size because it may not have the same management structure and processes as a smaller firm. Organizational changes can help improve efficiency, reduce costs, and increase the likelihood of achieving goals, among other benefits for the supply chain. One of the most significant ways in which organizational change can affect the supply chain is by establishing a stronger link between marketing and procurement. This link is vital because marketing professionals will know which goods to source and at what price, while procurement experts will know where these goods are being sourced, by whom, and what the quality of these goods is like. By bringing these two departments together and making their interactions more productive, you can greatly improve the flow of goods from suppliers and help them arrive at the right place at the right time.

Lean Manufacturing

Another way in which you can add value to your supply chain is by making the most of lean manufacturing principles. The concept behind lean manufacturing is to remove all inefficiencies in the production process so that goods are made on time and with the least possible cost. You can do this by analyzing every part of your production process, from procurement to the shipment of goods, and making changes wherever they are needed. You can also make use of technology to track goods throughout the entire supply chain. For example, you can use sensors and blockchain technology to track goods during the shipping process. This will give you real-time insights on the status of shipments and help you respond quickly to any changes in their progress. There are also software solutions that can help you optimize your production process by providing real-time optimization. This can help you avoid bottlenecks and find ways to increase production with limited resources.

Automation

If you’re able to achieve lean manufacturing and boost your efficiency, then you’re halfway there when it comes to adding value to your supply chain. However, you can go one step further by automating parts of your operations. Automation, in this context, doesn’t just refer to robotic production lines. Instead, it can encompass a variety of different technologies that can streamline your business. You may want to consider investing in software that will help you automate certain tasks. For example, there are software solutions that can help you automate your procurement activities by streamlining your sourcing activities and improving collaboration. Automation can also help you create a smoother customer experience. By using automation technologies such as virtual assistants or chatbots, you can reduce the time it takes to respond to customer requests or complaints.

Data Gathering and Analysis

Finally, you can add value to your supply chain by taking a close look at your data and analyzing it to see what improvements can be made. You can use a variety of different tools to get an in-depth analysis of your data, including advanced analytics software or business intelligence software. One of the most common ways in which businesses use data to improve their supply chain is by managing inventory levels. You can use data to find out how quickly your current inventory is being used and when you will need to replenish your stock. The same goes for the flow of goods, such as raw materials that are used in your production process. You can use data to track the flow of materials and make sure that nothing gets delayed. Data can also help you improve your customer experience. If you can track the customer journey from start to finish, you can identify any bottlenecks that might be occurring and take steps to improve them. By investing in data gathering and analysis, you can improve how your supply chain operates and how customers are served.

Supply Chain Improvement

Finally, you can add value to your supply chain by actually improving your supply chain. This could involve changing the suppliers you work with, switching to different materials, or making other major changes. This might sound costly and difficult, but it doesn’t have to be. To begin with, you can use the data you have gathered to create a list of potential suppliers that are best suited to your needs. You might even be able to find suppliers who will compete for your business and offer you better prices as a result. Once you’ve found suppliers who will meet your requirements, you can then work with them to determine which type of materials would be best for your production process. You can then try to negotiate with your existing suppliers to change to the new materials.

Conclusion

A company’s supply chain is a way of creating value for its customers by fulfilling orders in a timely, cost-effective manner. By adding value to your supply chain, you can ensure that your customers receive the products that they need and want as quickly and efficiently as possible. Adding value to your supply chain can be done in several ways, including creating organizational change, implementing lean manufacturing principles, implementing automation, analyzing data, and improving your supply chain.

Rockwell Automation taps Nvidia to bring AI to its bots,https://www.manufacturingdive.com/news/nvidia-rockwell-automation-partnership-ai-robotics-otto/718535/,19 часов назад,"Listen to the article 3 min This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback

Dive Brief:

Rockwell Automation will soon use Nvidia’s artificial intelligence software in its autonomous mobile robots, the two companies announced last week.

The automation company will integrate Nvidia's AI robot development platform, dubbed Isaac, into Rockwell's Otto autonomous mobile robots, meant for use in manufacturing facilities.

The project is part of an ongoing collaboration between the two companies to expand the use of AI in manufacturing. In March, Nvidia and Rockwell announced they were working together to create digital twin software that incorporated the AI chipmaker's Omniverse cloud platform.

Dive Insight:

Rockwell is pushing to bring AI to more of its products as a way to better tap into customer needs.

The company is also working with Microsoft to offer new AI-powered data solutions as it seeks to further its AI portfolio. Rockwell expanded its partnership with Microsoft last fall to add the tech giant's OpenAI software to its industrial automation cloud platform.

“By combining Microsoft’s AI capabilities and trusted cloud platform with Rockwell’s industrial automation solutions, manufacturers will have the tools they need to speed up these objectives and create smart factories of the future,” Dominik Wee, corporate VP of manufacturing and mobility at Microsoft, said in an April statement.

The work with both Nvidia and Microsoft is part of Rockwell’s strategy to focus on “specific customer use cases, especially those that will benefit from simulation and simplification using artificial intelligence,” Chairman and CEO Blake Moret said on a May 7 earnings call.

“These partners recognize that machines and manufacturing processes represent an enormous largely untapped source of data,” Moret said. “They also know we have the manufacturing domain expertise to select the best use cases for their technology.”

Companies have been using autonomous mobile robots for several years to boost warehouse efficiency and lower labor needs — Amazon and DHL Supply Chain both deploy the tech in their facilities. Now, however, more companies are integrating AI into robotics technology to boost its abilities.

Nvidia, for example, boasts that more than a dozen robotics industry leaders are now using its Isaac platform, including BYD Electronics and Siemens. Siemens, which has multiple collaborations with Nvidia, is using the software to integrate vision AI into its industrial robotic ecosystem. Nvidia and Siemens plan to roll out new capabilities related to the tech later this year.",supply chain automation startups
The Future of Supply Chains: Benefits of Elastic Logistics,https://www.vico.com.hk/resource/news/elastic-logistics,N/A,"THE FUTURE OF SUPPLY CHAINS: BENEFITS OF ELASTIC LOGISTICS ​

Today's fast-moving world means many companies have to begin moving with the times and trends to keep up with customer satisfaction and create more significant opportunities for themselves.

Supply chain demand and change can fluctuate at any moment, meaning firms have to be ready to adjust at any given time to meet demand; this now popular model used by warehousing and logistics teams is known as elastic logistics.

What Is Elastic Logistics?

Elastic logistics refers to the method of conducting business and logistics planning that enables flexibility through being able to upscale and downscale logistical capabilities dependent on the demand of a supply chain.

Elastic Logistics also works hand in hand with other types of supply chain operations to reduce cost and improve in light of the current needs of these chains.

Automated solutions can play a big part in the effectiveness of elastic logistics, and both work together to help create coherence and adaptability.

ELASTIC LOGISTICS- SUPPLY CHAIN ADVANTAGES

Consumer demand & satisfaction

An instant advantage to logistics companies and supply chains is the ability to be able to, as stated, up and downscale operations on the spot; this immediately cuts risk and cost and enables the end customer to be satisfied with quick and on-time delivery.

Satisfaction is also increased by the use of automated solutions, as customers can not only track their packages in real-time visibility but easily change any details that may be required.

This is an instant advantage to companies as the more likely consumers are to be loyal to their firm through this, meaning great profit and growth and improved customer experience.

Cost-saving

Using elastic logistics in supply chain management means reducing and deducting supply chain operations enhance cost-saving.

This is done by being able to reduce workload, transportation, and delivery operations to fit the new scale of demand, meaning no money is lost, and actual costs are saved through this.

Another cost-saving and efficiency factor through elastic logistics is the management of all deliveries and automation processes through one dashboard and filter. This means that any unexpected costs and projects can be dealt with increasing efficiency; this enables reliable financial control as all logistics operations are overseen with care, ease, and reduced risk of missing anything.

Storage cost is also cut as the flexibility of drawing backorders and adapting to demand means companies do not have to spend as much on containers and space that may not be filled.

Route Optimization

In alignment with artificial intelligence in elastic logistics, route optimization enables significant advantages for supply chains and logistics companies. As firms remain competitive in this sector, companies rely on means and ways of technology and warehouse operations to stay at the top of their game.

Transportation management systems may optimize routes by adopting elastic logistics to find the quickest, most sustainable, and most reliable delivery route. The use of this enables outgoing deliveries to be sent on the best route through forecast risks.

Deliveries are sent strategically to reduce risk due to bad weather, heighten the speed of delivery based on congestion, and reduce costs through less fuel consumption providing greater sustainability.

These technological advancements help create profit and support operating supply chains better for the logistics industry.

How to Automate Your Supply Chain in One Day,https://shelfawarevmi.com/simple-steps-to-supply-chain-automation-digital-vmi/,N/A,"Digital vendor managed inventory (VMI) platforms have made supply chain automation fast and affordable. But not all VMIs are created equally. Be sure to choose a platform that doesn’t require complicated ERP or MRP integration and one that offers crucial supplier and distributor collaboration.

In the past three decades, VMI platforms have become a popular and smart way to re-direct manual labor, streamline supply chains, reduce costs, and improve product consumption visibility. Walmart was one of the first adopters in the 1980s and used VMI to manage its gigantic supply chain. However, VMI is no longer just for large companies.

VMI platforms have evolved to being a useful tool for companies of all sizes. And thanks to the Internet of Things and revolutionary technologies like RFID, implementation is easier than ever.

In general terms, VMI platforms allow a third party to manage inventories for manufacturers and other companies. The vendor is responsible for ensuring that the right products go to the right places at the right time and that the inventory shelves are never empty.

A digital VMI is much more robust. It manages complex supply chains, reduces labor and other costs, provides part consumption data and visibility, and reduces human errors.

However, some manufacturers shy away from automation because they often believe that implementing it can be scary, time consuming, and costs prohibitive. The ShelfAware platform debunks those concerns and demonstrates how you can implement a robust digital VMI supply chain management system today and be automated tomorrow.

How Digital VMI Helps Smaller Companies Get Automated Quickly

Automating a complex supply chain in one day seems impossible. But ShelfAware makes it happen for many reasons. Here are some ways a robust digital VMI helps small-to-medium-sized companies embrace automation quickly, effectively, easily, and affordably.

1. There is no need to integrate with current ERP and MRP systems.

ShelfAware is a digital VMI platform that is designed to complement a company’s current ERP or MRP, not replace it. There is no need for integration to get a quick return on investment.

2. Integration is fast and easy.

Implementing ShelfAware’s robust platform is often complex but does not need to be slow. It begins with a group conversation involving a mix of finance, operations, and IT professionals. A site audit (often multiple sites) is usually required before a proposal can be made. Final proposals usually involve a formal stocking agreement, installation fee, and a product pricing quote. Onboarding consumers varies widely, but the minimum time required to convert a supply chain in most markets is about three months.

3. Managing a complex supply chain doesn’t have to be expensive.

Better inventory management equates to leaner on-hand inventory. This leads to less waste and fewer people required to manage your inventory. The ability to place a single PO with a single VMI partner allows you to reduce hidden soft costs that add up over many parts and many orders.

ShelfAware’s sophisticated software and hardware solution is a service, so it’s billed monthly for about $1000 per month. Once ShelfAware is installed, there are no other upfront costs. The hardware uses standard off-the-shelf Zebra products, so it’s inexpensive and readily available.

"AI, Automation & Algorithms Reshaping Ecommerce Logistics",https://www.codept.de/blog/how-ai-automation-and-algorithms-are-reshaping-e-commerce-logistics,N/A,"As is well-known, the pandemic has triggered a veritable boom in online shopping. Despite global retail sales falling by 3% in 2020, e-commerce volumes soared, rising by 27.6% for the year and reaching $4.3T. But with e-commerceâs continued growth come new challenges for retailers: keeping pace and managing huge amounts of orders, shipments and data efficiently. Combined with increasing consumer expectations and supply chain bottlenecks triggered by COVID-related lockdowns, all this creates enormous pressure for e-commerce logistics professionals.Â



To overcome these obstacles, AI, automation, and algorithms are proving to be critical assets in e-commerce logistics, which is inherently data-intensive and requires collaboration at various stages in the fulfillment process. Leveraging these disruptive technologies enables etailers to handle growing or fluctuating demand, satisfying customer expectations and, ultimately, become more competitive.



Thus, this article will explore the key applications of AI, automation, and algorithms in e-commerce logistics, and the benefits these disruptive technologies offer your business.

Artificial intelligence (AI)

Artificial intelligence has traditionally been defined as a computer or robot able to perform complex tasks that would typically require human intuition. As it exists today, AI is described by computer scientists as being ânarrowâ. Since AI systems donât currently possess lateral thinking skills, their current applications are limited to repetitive tasks, such as facial recognition, powering search engines, and aiding medical diagnoses. Existing AI systems are yet to have surpassed human intelligence, which is the ultimate goal of many researchers in the field.Â



Among the core competencies of AI are learning, reasoning, and perception, making it a fantastic tool for scenario-rationalization and optimal decision-making. As such, AI has a myriad of industrial use cases, from finance to the automotive sector. With its strong suite of analytical capabilities including data collection, storage, labeling, analysis, and decisions and feedback, AI has broad applications as a problem-solving tool in the complex world of e-commerce logistics.



E-commerce logistics is especially data-intensive and requires collaboration across multiple business units. Given its ability to leverage data to aid decision-making, AI is a powerful vehicle for harnessing critical predictive analytics, which ultimately enables effective supply chain management (SCM). AI can be deployed to forecast supply chain bottlenecks, demand spikes or dips, or to optimize logistics. This information can then be used to help e-commerce stakeholders decide which warehouse or carrier to use and when to replenish their stock.

Automation

Automation involves using technology to perform an industrial function without or with little human intervention. Companies implement automation to optimize the efficiency and productive output of industrial processes. It has broad use cases, ranging from manufacturing to defense, and is also particularly well-suited to e-commerce logistics.



There are two main subsets of automation in an industrial context: business process automation (BPA) and robotic process automation (RPA).

Business Process Automation

Also known as digital transformation, BPA is the tech-enabled automation of business processes. BPA involves managing data flows among other business processes to optimize performance and resource allocation and minimize costs. BPA supports knowledge workers in handling business-critical issues and aims for enterprise-wide efficiency.



In an e-commerce logistics environment, an example of BPA would be automated order entry. Processing orders manually can be complex and cumbersome due to the high volume of orders and the collaboration required across multiple teams, such as finance and logistics. Manual order entry also takes far longer and contributes to a higher error rate. The time spent correcting these errors contributes to declining revenues and delayed delivery. Automated solutions enable greater efficiency in order processing, minimizes costs, and increases overall ROI.

Robotic Process Automation

RPA optimizes an organizationâs efficiency by automating mundane tasks that would have previously required human action. RPA is a machine learning-enabled software application that automates rules-based, repetitive actions.



In an e-commerce logistics environment, RPA can serve as a great inventory management tool. Automated RPA bots can oversee stock control and notify stakeholders of any likely stock-outs. This improves supply chain visibility and enables supply chain managers to identify issues before they become problems.



Another one of the principal applications of automation in e-commerce logistics is warehouse automation. The e-commerce boom has underlined the importance of efficient parcel sortation. Automated conveyor systems equipped with scanners can identify the bar codes anywhere on a package and send it in the appropriate direction. Similarly, automated pick-and-pack technologies are deployed to ensure maximum efficiency. Robotic arms equipped with sensors determine the dimensions of an object before safely grasping and packing it.

Algorithms

â

Algorithms are instruction manuals, providing computers with a step-by-step guide for carrying out a specific function and achieving the desired outcome. With any algorithm, there are 3 core components. In many ways, it is similar to following a recipe while cooking.



Input: The information available to the system before beginning. These are the ingredients. Algorithm: A set of instructions the computer must follow. This is the recipe. Output: The desired outcomes. This is the product of having deployed the ingredients as instructed in the recipe.



Given how data-intensive e-commerce logistics is, algorithms are a great tool for satisfying the end consumer and driving business value. Many organizations are encumbered with multiple data sets and, as such, are reluctant to handle new sources of data. Algorithms are the key for unlocking the powerful insights their data provides them with and making powerful decisions on the back of it.



These qualities give algorithms a suite of multi-sector applications. Financial analysts deploy algorithms to predict future capital markets activity by analyzing asset return movements and modeling for future risk and volatility. Similarly, in e-commerce logistics, algorithms are a tremendous SCM asset. Heuristic algorithms, which are designed to solve problems at speed, can be deployed in computational logistics to optimize efficiency when it comes to order fulfilment and last-mile delivery. In addition to ensuring timely delivery, algorithms are also used to ensure the ready supply of the desired product.



The impact on e-commerce logistics

AI, automation, and algorithms already have a myriad of use cases in e-commerce logistics.Â



AI enables stakeholders to harness critical predictive analytics, especially when it comes to forecasting supply and demand and anticipating supply chain problems. This has the overall effect of maximizing supply chain efficiency, which in turn, keeps costs down, and the end consumer satisfied.



Automation enables greater efficiency in the packaging and sortation processes in warehouses and fulfillment centers. More efficiency in these large, complex facilities directly translates to more timely, organized delivery to the end consumer.



In densely-populated urban centers, traffic poses a major challenge to those on the fulfillment end. Algorithms can be used to identify optimal distribution routes, which will enable distributors to reach the end consumer safely and promptly. With nearly half of all online shoppers saying same-day delivery would persuade them to shop online, being able to offer timely fulfillment based on advanced algorithms will give any e-commerce business an edge.



Of course, these technologies donât come without any downside. However, as the graphic below shows, the opportunities that AI, automation and algorithms present for etailers, usually outweigh the potential risks.

â

Below we will look in more detail at the specific use cases of these technologies in e-commerce logistics.

Use cases of AI, Automation, and Algorithms for Etailers

Supply Chain Management

The success of e-commerce logistics operations hinges on extensive planning and collaboration between different teams throughout the entire fulfillment process. Advanced AI systems and algorithms enable significant supply and demand forecasting through powerful data-driven, predictive analytics. Leveraging these insights empowers logistics professionals to maximize supply chain efficiency by tackling issues before they become problems.Â



As such, AI-driven demand forecasting tools significantly minimize error rates compared to traditional forecasting methods, outperforming traditional methods such as Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) in terms of accuracy and value of insights. This enables optimal resource allocation, especially from a distribution standpoint. For example, etailers can dispatch the correct number of vehicles to local warehouses, which reduces operational costs thanks to enhanced personnel planning capabilities. Local warehouses and fulfillment centers can also minimize their holding costs - the opportunity cost of keeping an item with low sales in stock. AI-driven demand modeling is also a great tool for avoiding stock-outs, greatly improving the end consumerâs experience.Â



AI systems draw on a range of data sources to inform supply chain management decisions. When it comes to handling goods, they gather detailed insights such as the size, weight, and fragility of a product, not to mention any potential hazards it poses. Similarly, where fulfillment is concerned, they track the relevant information about the sender and recipientâs addresses to begin calculating distance and lead time. AI systems can also compare different carriers in terms of pricing and quality. An example for the latter would be looking at a carrierâs history of complaints about speed or damaged products. The technology is also able to unlock key predictive analytics when it comes to specific parcel hub proximity and their future capacity for storage and sortation of goods. This enables proper planning and shrewd decision-making.



Palantir, an American Big Data analytics giant, has recently formed a joint venture with the Boston-based enterprise AI software firm DataRobot. The two software players are collaborating on an AI-driven demand modeling platform to optimize for real-time solutions for demand forecasting problems. Ritu Jyoti, an AI and Automation expert at IDC (a global leader in market research), believes the forecasting powers unlocked by this partnership will limit lost sales and stock-outs, reducing overall warehousing costs. Similarly, the British e-commerce grocery retailer Ocado leverages AI and Big Data to offer a more personalized shopping experience, greatly enhancing CX. Machine learning algorithms use predictive analytics to suggest which products the end consumer might need to replenish. They also use AI systems in a demand forecasting capacity to predict sales for over 58,000 of their products.



Automated processes and warehouse robotics

Warehouse robotics is steadily emerging as a business-critical asset in e-commerce logistics, especially for the successful set up of micro-fulfilment centers. Without efficient sorting and packing technology within warehouses, timely distribution and last-mile delivery would also slacken, damaging an e-commerce brandâs overall reputation and potentially limiting business returns. The global warehouse robotics market surpassed a $3.97B valuation in 2020. Analysts broadly predict the market to be worth $7.63 by 2026, sustaining a Current Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 11.54% over the next 5 years. This boom is underpinned by rising IIoT (the Industrial Internet of Things) integration into e-commerce logistics supply chains, especially in warehouses and fulfilment centers. This enables:



Predictive maintenance

Enhanced damage identification

Enhanced order picking (AS/RS systems)

Autonomous delivery solutions



COVID-19 has elevated the role of robotics and automation in warehouses. The widespread implementation of social distancing measures has broadened the scope for automated processes in warehouses and fulfilment centers. As such, many e-commerce and logistics businesses are capitalizing on this trend. However, many leading players in the e-commerce logistics space were adopting automation well before the pandemic.Â



For example, in 2015 DHL collaborated with Beumer Group - a German intralogistics manufacturer - to design an innovative parcel automation and sortation system for its â¬140M Brussels logistics hub. A sophisticated system of 1,650 conveyor elements with a total of 6.6km of Beumer Group conveyor units in addition to 15 camera stations for 5-sided reading and 18 cameras for bottom reading at induction units with a total of 94 camera units was set up. Similarly, a computerized maintenance control (CMC) system was implemented in 6 of the sorters. Cross-belt loops were integrated with sensors to track and trace all the items moving during the automated sortation process. Additionally, shortest-path algorithms were deployed during the sortation process to send items on the fastest possible route through the facility. As a result, it now only took 6.5 minutes to sort an item to its destination and the shipment rate was increased from 12,000 to 32,500 parcels per hour.

AI and algorithms in the last-mile

AI systems and algorithms are important assets in optimizing for efficiency in the last-mile delivery stage of fulfilment, especially when it comes to partnering with carriers. Codept matches clients with ideal shipping providers and carriers using advanced algorithms. Their algorithm leverages data ranging from the recipientâs address, to product information and the promised delivery date. This is then used to select the optimal carrier and organize shipments within seconds.



Algorithms can also help cut costs on the distribution end. For example, one of Codeptâs clients saved around â¬0,20 per parcel by using their carrier selection algorithm. If they were shipping a volume of 500K parcels per year, their annual savings would reach â¬100K. Finally, an internal study also showed that timely delivery improves consumer satisfaction, which can lead to a Net Promoter Score increase of up to 21%.



How are AI, automation, and algorithms integrated into logistics software?

SaaS and other IT solutions in the logistics sector are already leveraging AI and algorithms to optimize for efficiency across their operations. They typically work on the back-end, hidden from the user, before providing them with actionable recommendations, or directly assisting them with automated processes and actions.



Codept helps e-commerce logistics businesses leverage disruptive technologies to deliver best-in-class customer experience (CX). This enables them to meet the rising expectations of delivery partners and the end consumer and crucially maximize ROI while managing multiple nodes of inventory. Codept achieves this through automated shipment optimization, Service Level Agreement (SLA) monitoring, and item-based order tracking with an early warning system in case of a delay. Similarly, its fully automated order tracking system allows for proactive case management, meaning issues can be tackled before they become problems. The company also automates parcel optimization based on shipping rules which you can self-configure, resulting in fewer clarification cases and liabilities for clients. Moreover, Codeptâs AI systems process the feedback from the performance data of your individual orders, such as transit time, costs, and customer satisfaction, which is subsequently relayed to the system for process optimization.

AI, Automation, and Algorithms - the new competitive advantage

AI, automation, and algorithms are proving to be critical assets in e-commerce logistics in the success of e-commerce logistics operations. Not only do these disruptive technologies maximize output and efficiency in warehouses and fulfilment centers, but they also minimize error rates and distribution delays. This all results in reduced costs, CX improvements, and return business. With e-commerceâs growth set to continue, leveraging these technologies will enable e-commerce logistics businesses to gain a competitive advantage.

Are touchless supply chains already a reality?

Touchless technology has been making successful inroads into different business sectors in recent times. On adopting the technology, the need for human intervention becomes minimal and it gives organisations a definitive competitive advantage. Traditional planning is primarily based on historical data but whenever a disruption occurs, all plans fail. Since supply chain disruptions are unpredictable, new approaches and tools are a necessity to keep the wheels of business running smoothly. Touchless planning is an effective way to introduce agility to supply chain planning. Also known as digital or autonomous planning, touchless planning lets machines undertake the massive task of aggregating and analysing data.

High-touch processes across organisational departments such as manufacturing, inventory, procurement, distribution and logistics involve huge amounts of data-driven manual work that is slow and costly and involves hundreds of human hours. The larger the organisation, the larger the number of products, partners, sites and customers. Errors are common, putting profitability, revenue, and customer satisfaction on the line. The volatile global business landscape today requires organisations to adapt swiftly to changing demands, fluctuating availability of raw materials and any unexpected political or economic events.

Cognitive automation is at the heart of touchless technology and it allows businesses to automate decision making whenever any exceptions occur. It involves applying sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms to data systematically collected and sorted for making business-critical decisions. AI and ML enable touchless planning in supply chains. The technology involves crawlers that explore all relevant data sources and arrange them in a way that best explains how all the data interacts with each other. Data is first collected from physical, internal and external sources, and then cleaned, sorted and enriched. Data is gathered and organised continuously. It is arranged so that it represents a true picture of the existing supply chain operation. The information provides a firm baseline on which to make business decisions and recommendations. As the employees interacting with the systems are professional planners, the decisions they implement are learned by the AI and ML tools and that ensures decisions and recommendations are refined more and more with time.

Cognitive automation brings in significant improvements in decision making and that makes the transition to a touchless supply chain controlled and efficient. Since the tedious and time-consuming task of data gathering and analysing is carried out by machines, employees of organisations can make decisions fast and focus on more critical and creative areas such as strategizing and negotiating with stakeholders, devising innovative solutions by thinking out of the box, and even ponder on what-if situations. Since the datasets are carefully collected and built, employees can also identify unexpected connections that might otherwise remain unnoticed.

After adapting cognitive automation, touchless planning can modify the very core of supply chains. Managers no longer have to spend hours analysing sales history and drawing forecasts, preparing manual documentation, or reviewing inventory movement. Instead they can focus on the results of all these processes. Whether it is a drop in sales, a lack of raw materials or a critical forecast, the cognitive automation platform with its analytic tools can be used to derive recommendations quickly and accurately. Recommendations could range from increasing or decreasing production capacity, inventory reallocation, reducing prices, or changing suppliers of various materials.

The automation platform generates recommendations based on the evaluation and comparison of all relevant factors related to sales and market trends, including weather effects. Employees can work as per actionable recommendations thereby increasing the number of decisions they can make each day. This translates to faster decision making abilities based on intelligent recommendations, one of the most important factors affecting the agility of supply chains. Further, with cognitive automation, decisions can be planned to a degree of detail that is almost impossible with conventional methods.

The procurement sector has been ready for touchless tools and platforms for some time now. It can help with automating processes and streamlining procurement by leveraging the power of data analytics. Touchless technology enables procurement divisions to gain better control over processes, reduce errors and thereby reduce rework, find lost or misplaced records easily, and accelerate the purchase order (PO) generation and ordering process. This ensures an efficient and better optimised procurement process.

Organisations that have successfully adopted cognitive automation began with pilot projects that overlay the new platforms over conventional systems without replacing the old systems. Only after experimenting, tuning and validating did they move from pilot projects to actual production and lay the foundation of touchless supply chains.

All organisations that depend on supply chain management are ideal candidates for touchless planning. The technology and processes involve costs that may be best afforded by large organisations or start-ups that plan to scale quickly.

* For organizations on the digital transformation journey, agility is key in responding to a rapidly changing technology and business landscape. Now more than ever, it is crucial to deliver and exceed on organizational expectations with a robust digital mindset backed by innovation.

Improve your response time

Being prompt and thorough when it comes to responding to leads is crucial for B2B sales success. A study published by Harvard Business Review reported businesses that take 42 hours to respond are too slow, while those responding within five minutes have eight times higher conversion rates. However, on average, it takes companies a little over 14 hours to respond to leads.

Here are a few ways to make a positive first impression with big businesses:

Send follow-up emails summarizing phone discussions.

Address all questions and concerns.

Anticipate additional queries.

Proofread for accuracy and professionalism.

Consider offering an online resource library.

Your response reflects how you conduct business, so strive to be quick, comprehensive, and attentive to gain a unique competitive edge.



Invest in technology

Using outdated technology and systems puts your business at risk of larger companies overlooking you. Today’s buyers expect their suppliers to operate at maximum efficiency and provide real-time data, so falling behind in technology and data analytics may mean losing out on top contracts.

To stay competitive as a small business, you should embrace and invest in modern technology and prioritize data analytics to meet your buyer’s expectations. Automation enhances efficiency and reduces errors, while accurate data collection enables real-time monitoring to identify bottlenecks.

How Cognitive Automation Can Switch Off 'Survival Mode' For ...,https://www.cognitiveautomation.com/resources/how-cognitive-automation-can-switch-off-survival-mode-for-supply-chains,N/A,"< Back to Home

COVID-19 continues to be a severe challenge for global supply chains. This year, weâre about to see bare shelves and high prices instead of Christmas gifts.

In a recent Gartner report, it appears the supply chain world is still focused on being demand-driven, which drives people to try to get the perfect plan in place. But like Steve Blank adage âno business plan survives contact with a customer,â there will never ever be a plan that addresses major weather events or unanticipated hiccups in the supply chain. This focus on generating the perfect plan prevents them from achieving resilience, or an ability to mitigate the risks of uncertainty and confront the unforeseen. This problem sharpens with COVID-19, as the pandemic has changed the need for resilience from a strategic move to an urgent tactical task.

As we approach the end of 2021, the news is still distressing: weâre witnessing a severe bottleneck all across the U.S., and consumers will be unable to purchase certain goods for Christmas. And to cope with these problems, demand-driven supply chains rather seek to overcome the current forecasting lags than seek to manage the unforeseen risks.

However, true resilience is not a survival-mode necessity but a strategic approach that harmonizes all the processes fast and proactively. And cognitive automation makes such strategic resilience happen, healing the supply chains fast and making them more future-oriented.

Cognitive Automation Helps Supply Chains Start Self-Healing

To help the supply chains today, the U.S. government has decided to open Canada and Mexico borders for vaccinated visitors and provide $17 billion in support for federal ports. Although these governmental incentives are helpful, they donât solve the huge set of remaining supply chain issues.

Companies are still relying on supply chains that were built in a different era. Though they were functioning well in stable years, the current challenges combined with an enormous demand make the need for innovation inevitable. The hyperautomated and âif-thenâ rule-based technologies are simply helpless in such situations.

Black swan events like global pandemics and ships stuck in ports need fast and accurate reactions. But the established enterprise processes make it hard for decision makers to act accordingly. Today, supply chains need fast and reliable tools to self-heal and keep driving their business value as never before. And cognitive automation possesses all the demanded tools to be the solution.

The capabilities of cognitive automation to not only collect and crawl Big Data but also find connections between various data points through recommendations helped Unilever and Merck at the very beginning of the global lockdown. By leveraging a cognitive automation system, these companies established a value-added process in their supply chains, adopting machine learning to reduce organizational anxiety and elevating the human endeavor to search for insights within transactional systems.

What Does A Resilient Supply Chain Look Like?

COVID-19 is not the only unexpected factor supply chains deal with. Recently, Southwest Airlines had to cancel 1,800 flights due to weather and staffing problems. With technology that collects data from numerous external sources at hand, the company could either predict and prevent this situation from happening or quickly solve the problem by recommending staffing optimization.

Cognitive automation is the technology capable of this type of real-time assessment.

Once a company introduces a cognitive automation platform, demand forecasting is usually an instant benefit. And then, this tool lets supply chains change the focus from enhancing forecasts accuracy to planning onto uncertainty.

Relying on the extensive and objective data, the platform makes recommendations that help in delivering and managing orders in real-time. If something unexpected happens, the system will notify about the changed circumstances and offer a new recommendation that takes new factors into account.

As the next step towards resilience, you can automate numerous internal processes with endless automation capabilities. Thanks to the cognitive nature of cognitive automation, you can teach the system to automatically execute certain processes and save precious time, and apply manual control over more critical tasks.

Building Proactive Innovation Through Better Decision-Making

Cognitive automation systems are able to make decisions faster and more accurately than humans. Empowered by AI/ML algorithms, they generate recommendations fast and accurately.

Once you decide to execute the recommendation, it will instantly notify the related machines and humans, creating a single implementation upper-layer that makes your decisions work. This way, cognitive automation establishes the basis of a sustainable and efficient enterprise, where all the critical operations and business processes are executed by a digital brain, leaving humans with strategic and creative tasks only.

Want to know more about how cognitive automation helps acclerate decision-making across the enterprise? Start here.

With cognitive automation, you can create a truly self-healing and resilient supply chain, or a system that has a real-time understanding of the entire operation and lets you think more about the future of your organization. You get an opportunity to observe the market trends and face the new crisis calmly and proactively. Â

Thatâs why cognitive automation is the tool for global supply chains to not only deal with current survival-related issues but also take over the leadership and improve the future.

Cognitive Automation Saves Your Precious Time

Unfortunately, cognitive automation cannot solve all the current global supply chain issues, like reverting climate change, stabilizing electricity supply in Asian factories, or releasing ships stuck in U.S. ports. But this technology can help you cope with your current challenges in a better and faster way, saving time to manage more strategic problems and collect necessary information on the âblack swanâ event consequences the machine should analyze.

Cognitive automation helps global supply chain companies by augmenting and automating their decisions. This way, it takes over the decision making complexity, as the supply chain is no longer a simple delivery from point A to point B and doesnât work as well today as it was prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Sophisticated processes need sophisticated tools, and cognitive automation meets the demand. It helps supply chains save the traditional focus on effectiveness and meet the contemporary demand for resilience.

Collaborative supply chain & logistics,https://wenda-it.com/en/focus/supply-chain-logistics-collaboration-among-companies/,N/A,"We usually tend to reduce the results of globalization to the news we read or the things we buy but it brought much more than this. First, it had an enormous impact on the supply chain and logistics. Today, it is impossible to think about a supply chain or logistics operation managed only by a single party or a single country. The inevitable result of this is the growing need for collaboration between the parties.

Everybody talks about collaboration but do we actually know what it means for a supply chain operation or why is it important and, moreover, what impact it can have on organizations?

Supply chain collaboration and collaborative logistics

Collaboration in supply chain and logistics means building supply chain operations on a culture of visibility and collaboration across all the partners.

In today’s supply chains disruptions are inevitable. Professionals involved in the process need to deal with unanticipated changes on a daily or weekly basis. However, since they need to navigate around different siloed and functional supply chain applications, they are not always able to mitigate the risks associated with these disruptions. Major losses can be avoided if we build working connections.

""The connection is a core element in all supply chains.""

If you think about it internally, you will see that processes, plans, people, and data created out of them are all connected inside an enterprise. If you think about it externally, on the other hand, you will see that enterprises are connected one to another. Since one enterprise alone cannot assume all roles, it will partner with other organizations, and entrust them with some crucial part of their operations. These connections with external partners will create the external supply chain of an enterprise, i.e. your external network.

Efficiency and cost savings become real, when key supply chain data, processes, plans, and people are connected both inside and outside of an enterprise. This way only, a supply chain can be streamlined.

There is no doubt that, compared to the past, today's supply chains are more complex and difficult to manage.

Think about it: a company buys products from a wholesale supplier, works with a logistics company to transport them, and then sells them in a third-party retail store. Each of those suppliers has suppliers of its own and its own logistics partners. There are different responsibilities for each segment and product chain of custody changes. Moreover, these operations can include multiple tiers of suppliers and/or multiple geographies. The actions and adjustments made by individual suppliers, distributors, production facilities, and channel partners affect one or more of the others.

""It means supply chains are extended.""

There is only one way of surviving in this extended ecosystem: collaboration, data, and management. In order to enable these last two, we turn our faces to technology.

What has changed?

Traditional systems are inward-looking. Today, companies buy TMS, WMS, etc., and connect everything to an ERP, pretending it can do everything. With the external supply chains generating the majority of information, unfortunately, ERP systems and other business applications that companies have used for decades, are not able to solve the level of complexity that we are experiencing.

These systems were designed to solve the problems of the enterprise, not the problem of the supply chain ecosystem. As a result, many companies are relying on exchanging Excel files with partners in order to fill this gap. However, these methods come with some limitations:

Manual data-entry

Risk of human error

A limited number of partners and information

Not automated, slow and sequential

Limited support for traceability

Siloed information



Therefore, using a system designed and developed with a single enterprise focus cannot be the answer to managing multi-enterprise focus and extended supply chains.

""Simply, it is like choosing the wrong size of shoes: you will not be walking barefoot but you will slow down and struggle since it is not the right fit.""

Here, the problem is not purely technological but more conceptual. In order to make the extended supply chains work, we need to shift our focus from single enterprises to multi-enterprises and create a functioning network. It means to stop thinking that our enterprise can stand in the market alone, without considering external factors that can impact only the long term: external relations can have high short term impacts.

What is a Multi-enterprise supply chain business network?

The term, “Multi-enterprise supply chain business networks (MSCBN)” coined by Gartner, defines this as “a community of trading partners — of any tier and type within a network — that needs to coordinate and execute supply chain processes across multiple enterprises.”¹



A supply chain network that connects all parties and allows them to operate as one virtual supply chain, to work off the same set of information, always up-to-date. Some also use the term “network of networks”. Since being connected does not mean only one singular network but different networks should rather be connected to each other. A good real-life example is how the telecommunications providers interoperate naturally with their peers, to ensure you can call a friend who’s using a different provider than yourself.

The definitions and bold terms might seem complicated but the concept is simple:

""One’s supply chain data feeds the other’s supply chain process.""

For example, the shipment information provided by a supplier will trigger the action of the carrier that will pick up the goods. The pick-up information of the carrier will be shared with the wholesaler (customer in this case). The wholesaler will organize its warehouse activities (inbound and outbound) according to the information received.

A survey conducted by Gartner shows that by 2023 more than 50% of organizations operating in the supply chain market space plan to share data across the partner ecosystem, establish common processes to operate it and have a technology platform in place to integrate with ecosystem partners.²

A collaborative and multi-enterprise supply chain software supports the different lines of business (procurement, supply chain, demand planning, order management, etc.) with solutions to make better and faster decisions using the up-to-date information from all the supply chain partners involved – from the end customer all the way to the raw material or parts supplier.

A collaborative supply chain software then should guarantee:

Single platform

Shared, single version of the truth

True end-to-end visibility and collaboration among supply chain partners

Automation, always up-to-date information

Complete support for traceability

As a result, collaborative software extends what ERP has done for the company within its organization and it provides a secure network for companies to coordinate supply chain activities in real-time. A pair of shoes that fits perfectly, speeds you up and eases your daily problems.

How to recognize a collaborative logistics solution?

Once the conceptual problem is solved, we can move forward with the technological one. So, which technologies can enable collaboration and management in supply chain and logistics?

""Numerous players offer network solutions with multi-enterprise support, however, not all of them are supply chain networks.""

Some of them offer only certain features of the solutions. For example, many technology companies are building networks of partners across specific niches in the supply chain like networks for transportation partners, air and ocean, freight forwarding, manufacturers and distribution.

The ideal multi-enterprise solution should include at least the following capabilities:

Multi-Party Network Collaboration: providing an integration layer to connect internal and external systems and parties and existing specialized networks to help you form a connected and collaborative network. A shared platform is essential.

Real-time Visibility : providing real-time, end-to-end supply chain visibility into all events and milestones for the order across all internal and external parties.

Events Management: enabling the planning team to re-plan and quickly manage exceptions in order to ensure OTIF.

Order and Inventory Management : order and inventory management functionalities with intelligent automation in orchestrating micro supply chains for each customer with optimized order flow across time, capacity, costs and inventory.

Analytics Dashboards : including predictive and prescriptive analytics, analysis of root causes and impacts.

Certainly, there are other features and functions that can be offered but these are considered the basis for a collaborative solution. The key value in these solutions is enabling real-time and intelligent process execution by providing normalized data, pre-built connections to major partners and other services. The solution and the applications should create shared value for both the primary tenant and its network partners.

Which technologies do enable collaborative logistics solutions?

In the evolving technology landscape, 3 technologies, in particular, are taking an important role in these solutions:

Cloud: cloud-based shared and interoperable platforms providing common and shared methods and the ability to achieve process synthesis.

Big Data Analysis: analysis of big and unstructured data sources allowing greater visibility for optimization.

AI and Machine Learning : leading more autonomous operations over time.

Lastly, the architectural platform supporting all this must be modern, which can operate processes across all the partners in the network.

""Digital supply chain ecosystems will become more and more important.""

According to a Gartner survey, more than half of organizations operating in the supply chain area plan to share data across the partner ecosystem, establish common processes to operate it and have a technology platform in place to integrate with ecosystem partners.³

Why do organizations need a collaborative solution?

As mentioned above, in today’s highly connected supply chains, companies face numerous challenges in managing them efficiently.

According to Gartner, these challenges include:

The activities and data mostly reside outside the enterprise.

Business applications to run them are not connected.

Leveraging available data is very difficult.

Engaging and collaborating with all business partners is time-consuming.

Leveraging many internal enterprise data and having enterprise-centric processes can not be a solution to overcome these challenges. This is because this approach leads only to delayed updates, limited visibility insights, a reactive mode for both planning and execution, optimization by object rather than outcome, and decision making mainly based on humans. From a technology perspective, on the other hand, it leads to relying on legacy solutions and often on-premises solutions.

Besides having applications in place to manage core enterprise capabilities (such as ERP, CRM, etc.), companies should look for solutions and business applications to connect with their business partners end to end, upstream and downstream. This will increase visibility and improve the insights leveraged.

The collaborative solutions including different organizations are designed to create this kind of connection between the parties and enable collaboration among them.



What are the real benefits?

Minimize risk

Today’s supply chains frequently encounter blind spots, such as failing to anticipate trade disruptions and supplier risk. The results can be extremely challenging for companies.

According to a survey conducted by Gartner, as of 2021, 68% of supply chain executives report that they have been constantly responding to high-impact disruptions over the last three years. And 67% report they have not had sufficient time to recover from a disruption before another high-impact event has disrupted their supply chains again. Moreover, a recent McKinsey & Company’s recent research found that over a 10-year period, firms may lose 42% of their annual profits due to disruptions. These blind spots can be avoided by increasing the visibility over internal but, most importantly, external processes.

A collaborative, multi-enterprise solution, alongside providing real-time, end-to-end supply chain visibility into all events and milestones for the order, connects all parties on a shared platform and allows them to share a single version of the up-to-date information. These will simplify the risk identification process, making organizations take action much sooner. Consequently, even if it will not be possible to mitigate every single risk that the company encounters, the quantity will definitely be minimized.

Increase Efficiency

Efficiency is all about the extent to which a process uses resources in the best way possible to ensure the fast, smooth running of systems.

""There is no “single, one-time cure” to achieve the most efficient supply chain.""

It’s a process that needs to be reviewed and optimized as often as possible with a continuous improvement methodology in mind. In order to do it right, you need accurate data and analysis of your operations, which will help you to identify areas of improvement where further efficiency can be achieved.

Therefore, it is logical to think that the more you store data on your supply chain, the more accurate solutions to increase efficiency will come out. A collaborative, multi-enterprise solution will provide you with not only your supply chain data but also the data of your external partners. Moreover, it will provide you with a common environment to work together, eliminating time-consuming manual activities like phone calls or report preparations.

Reduce Cost

A poorly designed supply chain network can lead to inadequate use of your resources. In these networks, any poorly-managed touchpoint between you, your suppliers and/or customers will raise costs, increase risks and result in poor customer service.

So, a well-designed multi-enterprise network, facilitated by accurate data over your internal and external operations, will lead you to the optimum use of human, technological, financial or physical resources and reduce operational costs and time wastage.

How to make collaborative solutions work in SMEs?

According to supply chain professionals, small and medium enterprises (SMEs) often are driven by the practical needs that the market generates. These organizations experience high levels of sales pressure deriving from the desire for growth.

""This leads them to adopt a reactive supply chain management approach.""

While the corporates and big enterprises adopt strategic supply chains, considering it as a competitive advantage. The supply chain should be a strategic topic also for SMEs.

Having a reactive supply chain management approach naturally leads to thinking about everything short-term and segmented or in silos, which is not something that helps to navigate the current market scenario. Supply chain disruptions, poor customer experience and external intangible risks touch a medium-sized company more than a larger one.

The insights gained from real players in the market showed that in order to make a multi-enterprise and collaborative solution work in an SME environment, the solution providers should focus on some important aspects.

SMEs should try to see the big picture

The issue is not about not being aware of the problem or not thinking about collaboration with external parties. It is about the fact that the SMEs identify the most evident pain points in their supply chains and look for short-term and practical solutions to eliminate them, often not taking into consideration the root causes. This can easily lead to opting for different systems for each pain point and managing their processes in silos.

Being able to see the big picture, understanding the root causes, and analyzing the processes and operations as a whole could help identify the most suitable solutions from the beginning. It also enables them to minimize the company risk and provides the basis for sustainable long-term growth.

Multi-enterprise collaborative solutions are not corporate-exclusive

These solutions are often not known by small and medium enterprises (SMEs). It is hard to look for a solution that you are not familiar with. It is critical to make these organizations understand the value hidden behind this complicated term. A collaborative multi-enterprise solution can offer a mix of light and simple supply chain software functions, allowing operational management as well as data analysis. The difference is about offering those as “multi-enterprise enabled”. It will help you to boost your internal operations and your extended supply chain!

Last but not least, hence the need for collaboration is known and accepted by most of the organizations in the global supply chain landscape, independently of their size, the collaborative multi-enterprise solutions should not be corporate-exclusive, meaning accessible only by big enterprises with significant economic resources.

Extended supply chain solutions do not compete with ERP or TMS/WMS..xMS

Daily talking with CEOs, supply chain professionals, operations managers, logistics specialists and quality officers shows that a supply chain system is often compared to a vertical management system (e.g. a TMS); it is not properly correct, as vertical management systems look inside the company processes and at very specific operations. Whereas a supply chain system has a broader scope, to report on multiple verticals, collecting data from TMS, WMS, etc, having strong data analytics capabilities and eventually planning. If the supply chain tool is built with many-to-many architecture, strong data capabilities, multiple-users accounts and help to work with external business partners, it can be considered a tool for your extended supply chain, a multi-enterprise and collaborative one.

Conclusions

Companies need to interact and work together to grow their businesses. A multi-enterprise network solution can enable collaboration among companies in supply chain and logistics and help them to simplify the risk identification and decision-making processes. Most importantly, it helps to create a common environment to work together, reducing the time-consuming manual activities to the minimum, if not eliminating them completely.

Two companies will guide global supply chains,https://www.thestar.com.my/business/insight/2024/06/11/two-companies-will-guide-global-supply-chains,3 дня назад,"A splintering of global supply chains, driven by both political and business considerations, has hundreds of manufacturers and logistics providers debating where to go next.

They’d be well advised to take their cues from two Taiwanese companies who’ve led the charge.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) is the world’s largest maker of chips, with clients including Apple Inc, Nvidia Corp and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.

Foxconn Technology Group, whose flagship is Taipei-based Hon Hai Precision Industry Co, assembles those components into end devices.

Apple’s iPhones and Nvidia’s artificial intelligence servers are among the most famous of Foxconn’s products, but its reach extends into industrial sectors including Tesla Inc cars and factory-automation systems provider Siemens AG.

Their size, technical dominance and global influence make these two Taiwanese companies irreplaceable – no other single business could jump in to fill the gap should either disappear overnight.

That’s the concern policymakers from Washington to Canberra have in the event tensions between Taipei and Beijing escalate to the point of military conflict. But both firms are thinking less about war and more about how globalisation can extend their lead.

“Instability in the Taiwan Strait is definitely one supply chain-resilience consideration,” TSMC chairman and chief executive officer C.C. Wei said after its annual shareholder meeting this month.

Yet the chipmaker also seen benefits from globalisation “because we can get the best from around the world.”

Foxconn has also been touting the upside of its expanded reach.

“Our diversified global footprint is an important part of Hon Hai’s competitive advantage,” chief executive officer Young Liu told shareholders recently, noting that it has 205 sites in 24 countries.

“In the current geopolitical situation, that advantage is even more important and obvious.”

Shifting position

Two decades after joining the World Trade Organisation, China’s position as factory to the world has shifted from being a win-win for clients and suppliers to a massive risk.

Labour shortages, rising costs and stiff local competition have many looking elsewhere.

Japanese and South Korean carmakers are withdrawing, US power-tool maker Stanley Black & Decker shut its factory, and Nike Inc has moved away.

One step away

TSMC and Foxconn don’t supply directly to all of these companies but they’re only one step away. Almost every device on the planet is made with, or by, the goods that come out of their factories.

TSMC, for example, not only controls most production of leading-edge chips, it’s the single-largest supplier of older (also called legacy) 28-nanometer semiconductors that go into toys, and industrial and agricultural equipment.

Foxconn, though best known for churning out consumer devices, is a major player in industrial manufacturing and factory automation.

That means the site of new facilities from either company act as a guidepost for where the rest of the supply chain is already going, or ought to move next.

Take TSMC. Although it doesn’t make cars, the company has chosen locations at the centre of the automotive supply chain. Volkswagen AG, BMW AG and Porsche all have facilities near Dresden, the site of TSMC’s forthcoming European fab.

Co-investors in that factory include Robert Bosch GmbH, Infineon Technologies AG and NXP Semiconductors NV. As a result, anyone who wants to supply materials or equipment to TSMC will need to have operations near the German city.

For its factory in Japan’s Kumamoto prefecture, TSMC is teaming up with Sony Group Corp, Toyota Motor Corp and automotive-electronics supplier Denso Corp. This facility will serve Japan’s world-leading carmaking, industrial and consumer electronics industries.

New investments

The expansion plan, announced in 2021, spurred suppliers Mitsubishi Electric Corp, Sumco Corp and Kyocera Corp to outline new investments in the area.

TSMC’s facility in Arizona is a different story. There’s no business case to be made for setting up there: The region lacks any related industries of note.

But pressure from clients, and incentives from US governments at the state and federal level, left the Taiwanese company little choice. Even then, suppliers were quick to follow, including industrial companies LCY Chemical Corp and Topco Scientific Co.

Foxconn’s decision to expand in Mexico, India and South-East Asia as well as numerous tie-ups with European industrial companies like Siemens, ZF Group and Stellantis NV show that its diversification is not only geographic but also sector-based.

The company is pushing into factory automation, transportation and logistics, aerospace, and alternative energy. Many of its current vendors built facilities in Shenzhen to enjoy the benefits of being close to China’s manufacturing heartland.

This Foxconn effect was repeated over a decade ago when it set up near central China’s Zhengzhou city and suppliers followed suit.

Now, because of their crucial role at the centre of industry, not only will the same entourage of vendors to TSMC and Foxconn need to tag along on their global journey, anyone else expecting to be part of international supply chains will have no choice but to follow, too. — Bloomberg

Top 5 takeaways from MLC's June manufacturing conference,https://realeconomy.rsmus.com/top-5-takeaways-from-mlcs-june-manufacturing-conference/,21 час назад,"From securing connected operations in the age of edge computing to easing the burden of technical debt, manufacturing executives converged in Marco Island, Florida, last week to discuss the industry’s most pressing issues.

The focus of the Manufacturing Leadership Council’s 2024 Rethink conference—also sponsored by RSM—was on accelerating digital transformation in the manufacturing sector and how businesses can develop smart factories that thrive in the future.

Read our top takeaways from RSM industrials senior analysts:

1. Automation remains a priority

Over the last two decades, manufacturing has made significant strides in embracing digital production models. However, the landscape keeps evolving as new technologies emerge, presenting both opportunities and challenges. Leading manufacturers are now reaping benefits from data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning, but many still struggle to keep up with the pace of digital change. One Rethink session examined a future in which connected workers harness the power of human-centered automation, augmentation and AI.

2. Business model innovation is paramount

Creating a strategy and adopting a business model to take advantage of Manufacturing 4.0 technologies makes it easier for manufacturers to navigate change and allows them to reinvent their business models to focus on value-added services. The conference’s keynote session focused on “how advanced technologies can help discover new products, service-based revenue opportunities, and new business operating models.”



3. Companies need to assess their technical debt

How can companies determine whether maintaining an existing system is more costly than installing a newer, better solution? One panel discussion—which included RSM Industrials Senior Analyst Matt Dollard—examined how businesses can assess if they’ve reached the tipping point, how this type of debt can be paid off, and how to create a smart strategy that will avoid accumulating technical debt in the future. Assessing so-called technical debt can be difficult but using a framework to quantify operational and financial impacts can make clear why it is critical.

4. Connectivity and artificial intelligence remain top of mind

Safety in manufacturing has evolved well beyond the physical. As manufacturers become more interconnected—combining traditional information technology functions, new Internet of Things devices and operational technology on the factory floor—strong cybersecurity measures and thorough risk management are paramount. One Rethink panel focused on the vast AI manufacturing use cases and zeroed in on the importance of securing data and overall data integrity, which requires a defined governance model.



5. Supply chain visibility enables greater agility

Harnessing the power of enabling technologies is one of the most effective ways to improve visibility and drive efficiencies across the supply chain.

UPS Strengthens Network Capabilities and Employee ...,https://about.ups.com/us/en/newsroom/press-releases/innovation-driven/ups-strengthens-network-capabilities-and-employee-experience--th.html,N/A,"ATLANTA – UPS (NYSE: UPS) has a long history of driving innovations that propel its business and bring industry-leading solutions to logistics. Today the company announced ways it is strengthening its network capabilities and enhancing employee experience through automation. UPS is leveraging technology to help reduce repetitive tasks and physical stress while promoting safety for the company’s employees. The technologies will also improve package flow and overall efficiency of the UPS network.

“UPS has been a technology company since its founding. Innovation is in our DNA,” said Carol Tomé, chief executive officer at UPS. “We continuously look for ways to leverage technology to improve our employee experience and increase efficiency. This is how we build a better and bolder UPS that will continue to be customer-first, people-led and innovation-driven for years to come.”

The company’s innovation strategy has long included the use of both digital and automation technologies and this has accelerated with advancements in AI.

Recently, UPS made several improvements in its operations targeting specific processes that can be repetitive and physically demanding such as pick-and-place, loading and unloading, and moving irregular-sized shipments.

UPS is using pick-and-place technologies powered by Dexterity, Fortna and Plus One Robotics to help employees sort small packages – a role that requires repetitive tasks and can be inconsistent as it flexes with customer demands. Once implemented, the technology will make these jobs easier, safer and offer a better overall experience for UPS employees.

Harnessing technology and innovation,https://www.england.nhs.uk/five-year-forward-view/next-steps-on-the-nhs-five-year-forward-view/harnessing-technology-and-innovation/,N/A,"The major work programmes mapped out in this Plan are underpinned by an agreed, costed and phased NHS technology plan, building on the recommendations of the Wachter review. It will simplify patient access to care, in the most appropriate location, while supporting people in managing their own health. Specifically, during the coming two years we will implement solutions that:

Make it easier for patients to access urgent care online.

Enable 111 to resolve more problems for patients without telling them to go to A&E or their GP.

Simplify and improve the online appointment booking process for hospitals.

Make patients’ medical information available to the right clinicians wherever they are.

Increase the use of apps to help people manage their own health.

Helping people manage their own health

The way that people use services has changed over the past ten years, often expecting to have the option of accessing services online or by telephone. Over the next two years the NHS will make very significant steps towards increasing how its services can be accessed online, whilst remembering that healthcare is about people and that many patients want and need the reassurance of a real person to talk to face to face.

The NHS has led the world for ten years with its health and care website “NHS Choices” which provides comprehensive and trusted advice on conditions and services. In 2016 there were more than 1.5 million visits per day of NHS Choices; over 550 million through the year. Progress has also been made in enabling patients to access their GP record online: 95% of GPs offer online appointment booking, repeat prescriptions and access to their summary care record. 10.4 million people are now registered for online services with 1.9 million repeat prescriptions ordered online in February 2017, 1.1 million appointments managed online and 1 million views of patient records in the same period.

NHS apps . In Spring 2017 we will launch the NHS Digital Apps Library with the initial offer including at least 20 apps with categories for Mental Health and Diabetes. This will comprise three tiers of application – ‘NHS approved’ apps which have a published evidence base, assessed by a process developed with NICE, demonstrating that they can help a person manage and improve their health; ‘NHS connected’ apps which means that they have been tested and approved for connection to NHS systems, allowing you to download information from NHS systems into the app; and ‘Health apps’ which will be directory of other health applications which you may choose to use. From April 2017, developers will have the ability to self-assess themselves against NHS criteria, such as where they store your data and whether they sell or use your data for other purposes. The ‘NHS connected’ category will become vibrant during 2017 and 2018 as we make it easier for app developers to connect to NHS data sources.

Building on the success of the NHS wifi early adopter stage, which commenced in January 2017 and saw us roll out free wifi for patients and professionals across approximately 1,000 surgeries, the wider rollout to the remainder of GP surgeries over the next year, subject to HM Treasury approval, will help encourage the uptake of online health services.

Digitising hospitals

While the NHS leads the world in the use of IT in primary care, the adoption of information technology in the acute, community and mental health sectors lags behind. In 2015, NHS England conducted a survey of information technology adoption, known as the Digital Maturity Assessment. From this we are able to see the best, the worst and the large number in the middle. In September 2016 we announced the first 12 Global Digital Exemplar acute trusts and since then we have announced four more.

Global Digital Exemplars. These organisations are the most advanced IT hospitals in the NHS and have committed to work to become world class exemplars for the rest of the NHS to learn from. Their task is not only to become great, but to work with other acute trusts to develop a blueprint that can be deployed to other hospitals, reducing the time and cost for further adoption. Our intention is that, in the future, hospitals won’t merely choose an IT vendor, they will choose a hospital that they want to partner with and implement the same system, keeping the IT 80% the same and making only the 20% of changes that are absolutely necessary to meet local needs. Subject to HM Treasury capital approvals, the first Acute GDEs are:

Alder Hey Children’s NHS Foundation Trust

Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust

City Hospitals Sunderland NHS Foundation Trust

Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust with Chelsea and Westminster NHS Foundation Trust

Luton and Dunstable University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust

Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust

Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust

Royal Free London NHS Foundation Trust

Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust

Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust

Taunton and Somerset NHS Foundation Trust

University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust

University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust

University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust

West Suffolk Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust

Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Foundation Trust

In order to spread the learning and ensure that the blueprints really are suitable for other hospitals, the GDEs will be partnered with “fast followers” who will work with the GDEs during their implementation and begin deploying the blueprints elsewhere in parallel. The GDEs are currently identifying their “fast follower” sites, and these will be confirmed over the coming quarter.

Over the past few months we have also conducted a search for Mental Health digital exemplars. Subject to HM Treasury capital approvals, successful organisations will be:

Berkshire Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust

Birmingham and Solihull Mental Health NHS Foundation Trust

Mersey Care NHS Foundation Trust

Northumberland, Tyne and Wear NHS Foundation Trust

Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust

South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust

Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust

NHS Digital Academy. By September 2017 we will launch a new academy to train a new generation of Chief Information Officers and Chief Clinical Information Officers. By increasing the skills to align information technology with business and clinical needs we will increase the chances of successful adoption of new information technology and its use to drive quality and efficiency.

Technology to support the NHS priorities

Urgent and Emergency Care

NHS 111 Online. Throughout 2017 we will be working to design online triage services that enable patients to enter their symptoms and receive tailored advice or a call back from a healthcare professional, according to their needs. We will be testing apps, web tools and interactive avatars in local areas and using detailed evaluation to define the best approach. By December 2017 all areas will have an NHS 111 online digital service available that will connect patients to their Integrated Urgent Care via NHS 111.

NHS 111 Telephone: Clinical decision support systems are well used throughout the health system. They have supported our ambulance services and urgent care services for many decades. The developments in technology mean these systems are improving exponentially – becoming more personalised and intelligent and able to process more data in real time. From summer 2017 we will be developing and testing new specialist modules of clinical triage for Paediatrics, Mental Health and Frailty and demonstrating the impact of risk stratification. By March 2019 an enhanced triage will be available across integrated Urgent Care, with the potential to also support Urgent Treatment Centres, Care homes and Ambulance services.

To ensure that patients get the right care in the most appropriate location, it is also important that clinicians can access a patient’s clinical record. By December 2017 every A&E, Urgent Treatment Centre and ePrescribing pharmacy will have access to extended patient data either through the Summary Care record or local care record sharing services. We will also have access to primary care records, mental health crisis and end of life plan information available in 40% of A&Es and UTCs.

By December 2018 there will be a clear system in place across all STPs for booking appointments at particular GP practices and accessing records from NHS 111, A&Es and UTCs supported by improved technology APIs and clear standards.

During 2017 we will begin the work with vendors to seamlessly route electronic prescriptions from NHS 111 and GP Out of Hours to pharmacies via the Electronic Prescription Service (EPS). This will speed up the supply of medicines, and significantly reduce the time and cost involved.

Elective access and unwarranted variation

Analysis of activity across the NHS shows very large variations in the number of patients being referred to hospital outpatients, being followed up repeatedly in outpatients and receiving elective operations. These variations cannot be explained by differences in health need and are often present between different GPs in the same area and different doctors in the same hospital. Patient and clinician time is wasted on repeating tasks because the information collected by another clinician is not available, and straightforward tasks that could be undertaken by many patients online are still done by clinical staff.

By summer of 2017 GPs will be able electronically to seek advice and guidance from a hospital specialist without the patient needing an outpatient appointment.

In the summer 2017 an updated online patient appointment system will be launched, providing patients with the ability to book their first outpatient appointment with access to waiting time information on a smartphone, tablet or computer. Alerts will advise patients which hospitals have longer waits so that that they can avoid these hospitals if they wish.

The NHS e-Referral Service is currently used by patients to arrange just over half of all referrals into consultant-led first outpatient appointments. By October 2018 all referrals will be made via this route, improving patients’ experience and offering real financial and efficiency benefits.

Digital contribution to research

The ability to collect, aggregate and analyse the data generated by the NHS is not only critical to delivering the triple aims of healthcare, but also underpins the NHS and wider life sciences research strategies. Interoperability will be key to successfully making use of NHS data to support the life sciences research strategy.

Innovation for future care improvement

The UK has a world-leading life sciences industry which is both a magnet for investment and an engine for economic growth – enhancing productivity, driving healthcare innovation and employing over 220,000 people across the regions of the UK. Many important healthcare technologies – from vaccines to MRI scanners – have been nurtured by our strong science base and universities, innovative culture and leading healthcare system.

Over the past year alone:

NHS England agreed to commission nationally 33 ground-breaking new treatments, including auditory brainstem implants for people with profound hearing loss; microprocessor controlled prosthetic knees for people with lower limb loss; and Ivacaftor for young children with cystic fibrosis.

A new Innovation and Technology Tariff (ITT) aims from April 2017 to expedite uptake and spread of innovation across the NHS. The first six innovations will mean 160,000 patients eligible to benefit. These products include those that reduce obstetric anal sphincter injuries as a result of episiotomies; reduce incidence of ventilated associated pneumonia which causes between 3,000 and 6,000 deaths every year; and provide effective treatment for clostridium difficile without the use of antibiotics.

We have also established a national Clinical Entrepreneurs Programme, and the NHS Innovation Accelerator which has supported adoption of innovations that at least 390 organisations are now using.

13 new NHS Genomic Medicine Centres have been established across the country to collect samples, engage patients and family members in the programme to establish the infrastructure needed to make genomic medicine a routine part of NHS care. These centres have collected over 25,000 cancer and rare disease samples. Over 20,000 whole human genomes have been sequenced. By sequencing the genomes in these samples not only can we better understand these diseases, we can also target specific treatments on the patients who will benefit most from them.

PHE has supported ground-breaking research which has led to a new technique for sequencing the genome of the bacteria that causes tuberculosis. This technique will enable faster and more targeted treatment of people with TB. Speedy diagnosis will also help scientists detect and respond to potential outbreaks as they happen. This matters since the UK still has one of the highest rates of infection in Europe.

The NHS has invested in the Small Business Research Initiative Programme to support 80 small and medium enterprises.

For 2017/18 and 2018/19 the NHS will take further steps to enhance our global position:

Begin the roll out of new treatments funded by NHS England’s specialised commissioning, including mechanical thrombectomy treatment for stroke.

NHS England will publish an Implementation Plan setting out its delivery contribution to the UK Strategy for Rare Diseases in 2017/18.

Expand the NHS’s genomics capability, collecting 50,000 samples in 2017/18 rising to 90,000 in 2018/19. By the end of the 2018 calendar year, 100,000 whole human genomes will have been sequenced. By the end of 2018/19, we will also have developed a genomic medicine service for England, underpinned by a new consolidated genomic laboratory infrastructure and facilitated by informatics, data and analytical platforms to enable the sequencing data we generate to improve clinical practice.

Create a more fertile environment for clinical trials by enhancing the Health Research Authority, harmonising approval and recruitment processes, and streamlining bureaucracy including through the use of digital tools.

One of the unique features of the NHS is the central role of general practice and this creates valuable opportunities to study ‘longitudinal’ data. NHS England and MHRA increased the number of GP practices registered on the Clinical Research Practice Data Link system (CPRD) by 25% in 2016/17 and in 2017/18 we will recruit an additional 1800-2000 practices to CPRD.

In 2017/18, the NHS Innovation Accelerator will select another round of innovations that address the population challenges prioritised by STPs.

Academic Health Science Networks and ‘test beds’ will take collective responsibility for driving national adoption of proven innovations, in line with the Accelerated Access Review.

The NHS’s international reputation has already led to major agreements with China, the Middle East and Latin America over the last few years, helping put money back into the NHS and UK economy and strengthening our investment in R&D. Healthcare UK (the export organisation for the UK’s health and care sector) has helped health sector organisations win over £5 billion worth of contracts over the last three years. Healthcare UK aim to grow our exports by around 15% per annum to 2020.

More generally, under the banner of the government’s Industrial Strategy, the life sciences sector deal will bring government and the NHS together with industry and charities to create new jobs and economic growth across the UK as well as aiming to improve care for NHS patients. The NHS is a key contributor and a committed partner to providing an environment where technologies can be developed and tested, and used to transform services to improve outcomes and reduce cost. This opportunity sits alongside further strengthening of the science base and clinical trials capability and the creation of an environment which enables small biotech and medtech companies to thrive and grow, and enhancement of our medicines manufacturing capabilities.

As medicine transforms over the next 20 years, the cutting-edge technology in our Universities combined with the NHS presents unique conditions to create new industries, companies and jobs based in the UK and transform the way innovation is delivered to patients, offering an attractive place to research and test new treatments in partnership with innovators. Potential areas include artificial intelligence, the application of genomics to medicine, the development of a range of new diagnostic tools, and therapies for conditions that will enable more healthy aging.",innovative freight processing technologies
Overview of the Green Innovation Fund Projects,https://green-innovation.nedo.go.jp/en/about/,N/A,"Overview of the Green Innovation Fund Projects

In October 2020, Japan declared that it aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, with the goal of reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050. Carbon neutrality by 2050 cannot be realized through ordinary efforts. It is necessary to significantly accelerate efforts toward structural changes in the energy and industrial sectors, and undertake bold investment for innovation.

METI decided to develop a Green Innovation Fund at the level of 2 trillion yen* as part of the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO). The plan, based on the specific goals shared by public and private sectors, is to continuously support companies and other organizations for the coming ten years, which show their commitment to challenge such ambitious goals as their business issues ranging from research and development (R&D) to demonstrations to social implementation of the outcomes.

Efficient Production Logistics through Innovative Material ...,https://info.servus.info/en/blog/more-efficient-production-logistics-through-innovative-material-flow-technology,N/A,"Modern material flow technologies can both support process-oriented structures and revolutionize intralogistics using newer and more efficient processes. For example, the “injection principle” involves delivering small volumes of the material directly to the target location using an autonomous transport robot. This reduces the handling process, accelerates the material flow, keeps routes short, and also saves outlay on expensive production and storage areas.

The factory planning competence center integrates the “injection principle” into the factory layout design in order to support medium-sized manufacturing companies and open up additional space without new building. Production area with local supermarket shelves on individual machines .





Figure 1.

Legacy: Production area with local supermarket shelves on individual machines.

A typical production area planned according to lean criteria, mostly consists of local “supermarkets”, which take the form of continuous flow racks on individual machines: Figure 1. The machine operator takes the parts off the supermarket shelf, on which all the parts required for the respective production step are available. The empty containers are then put back on the shelf and slide outwards. This solution takes up a comparatively large amount of space for the supermarket shelves and thus necessitates long routes in multiple machine operation. Additionally, a large amount of space is necessary for the paths and stops.

Innovative injection principle

In contrast to this, the basic idea of the injection principle is not to supply material from the outside on a large scale, but instead to “inject” it in small quantities into the production area as closely as possible to the machine location. Put into practice, this mean provisioning material from the top directly to the necessary location – right into the center of the path- optimized multiple machine layout. The material flow direction is thus reversed. Material provisioning takes place internally as opposed to externally, and the material then flows from the inside outwards. Following the injection principle, conveying relies on state-of-the-art material flow technology routed along the hall ceiling. On the ground, only the delivery point in the form of a container lift is required. As a result, the machines can be located closer to each other. Due to the speed and the responsiveness of the system, the supermarket shelves are omitted. Empty containers are returned to the system and transported to the empties station via the container lift.

Figure 2.

Viable with innovative technology: Injection principle with material output in the middle of the machines.

Figure 2 visualizes the injection principle approach. Material is provisioned for the machine operator via the output tower at the center; the operator feeds the machine. Compared to a conventional solution, the worker area can be kept smaller because the employees no longer have to fetch the material from the edge of their area. This makes it is possible to achieve shorter routes and trouble-free multiple machine operation. The worker only has to enter the machine area in the event of a fault, for change-over procedures or similar events. It is only occasionally that tasks, for example, changing a container for finished products, have to be carried out in the finished component area (green area). Paths can be reduced by more than 50%.

Agile Transport Robots in Use

Innovative transport robots, which act as local “swarm robots” are the enablers of the injection principle. This means that, for example, all internal logistic processes – from incoming goods, through the warehouse, office, production, assembly, picking, to outgoing goods – are integrated into an efficient, seamless flow process.



One example of such innovative transport robots is the “intelligent” and autonomous “Servus ARC3” (Autonomous Robotic Carrier 3) transport robot. Individually configured for size, performance or load handling attachment, it can transport numerous products and materials. They range from simple cardboard boxes, boxes and trays to bulk goods or customer-specific workpieces of up to 50kg. Equipped with state-of-the-art technologies – such as ABS (anti-blocking system), ESP (electronic stability system), ASR (traction control) and energy management with energy recovery – the ARC is a reliable, low-maintenance product.



The load handling attachments integrated into the ARC allow for independent loading and unloading on the left or right along the route. The autonomous robot receives its orders from the control center (directly connected to the customer software) via high-frequency wireless technology; it handles the tasks independently, always taking the shortest route. Thanks to modular components, the system can be flexibly tailored to customer needs from a modular assembly kit with bearing and track components, thus saving space for the customer.

N4C offers area-efficient foundation IP and design rules that are fully compatible with the widely-adopted N4P, with better yield from die size reduction, providing a cost-effective option for value-tier products to migrate to the next advanced technology node from TSMC.

CoWoS®, SoIC, and System-on-Wafer (TSMC-SoW™ ): TSMC’s Chip on Wafer on Substrate (CoWoS®) has been a key enabler for the AI revolution by allowing customers to pack more processor cores and high-bandwidth memory (HBM) stacks side by side on one interposer. At the same time, our System on Integrated Chips (SoIC) has established itself as the leading solution for 3D chip stacking, and customers are increasingly pairing CoWoS with SoIC and other components for the ultimate system-in-package (SiP) integration.

With System-on-Wafer, TSMC is providing a revolutionary new option to enable a large array of dies on a 300mm wafer, offering more compute power while occupying far less data center space and boosting performance per watt by orders of magnitude. TSMC’s first SoW offering, a logic-only wafer based on Integrated Fan-Out (InFO) technology, is already in production. A chip-on-wafer version leveraging CoWoS technology is scheduled to be ready in 2027, enabling integration of SoIC, HBM and other components to create a powerful wafer-level system with computing power comparable to a data center server rack, or even an entire server.

Silicon Photonics Integration: TSMC is developing Compact Universal Photonic Engine (COUPE™ ) technology to support the explosive growth in data transmission that comes with the AI boom. COUPE uses SoIC-X chip stacking technology to stack an electrical die on top of a photonic die, offering the lowest impedance at the die-to-die interface and higher energy efficiency than conventional stacking methods. TSMC plans to qualify COUPE for small form factor pluggables in 2025, followed by integration into CoWoS packaging as co-packaged optics (CPO) in 2026, bringing optical connections directly into the package.

"Connected, flexible, autonomous: BMW Group expands use of ...",https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/new-zealand/article/detail/T0287775EN/connected-flexible-autonomous:-bmw-group-expands-use-of-innovative-technologies-in-production-logistics,N/A,"Munich. The BMW Group is increasingly relying on innovations from the fields of digitalisation and Industry 4.0 in production logistics. This will ensure the company’s global production network continues to receive the parts it needs in a timely and reliable manner in the future. The focus is on applications such as logistics robots, autonomous transport systems at plants and digitalisation projects for an end-to-end supply chain. Staff can control logistics processes from mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets and use virtual reality applications to plan future logistics. Innovations coming out of many pilot projects are being implemented worldwide in logistics at BMW Group plants.

“Logistics is the heart of our production system. Our broad spectrum of ground-breaking projects helps us run increasingly complex logistics processes efficiently and transparently,” according to Jürgen Maidl, head of Logistics for the BMW Group production network. “We are taking advantage of the wide range of available technological innovations and working closely with universities and start-ups. We are already working with tomorrow’s Industry 4.0 technologies today.”

Around 1,800 suppliers at more than 4,000 locations deliver over 31 million parts to the 30 BMW Group production sites worldwide every day. Digitalisation and innovations help the company organise logistics more flexibly and more efficiently. At the same time, almost 10,000 vehicles coming off the production line daily must be delivered to customers around the globe. Digitally connected delivery, so-called Connected Distribution, ensures that these transport routes are also more transparent.

Connected Supply Chain: Full data transparency in the supply chain

The BMW Group supply chain relies on a global supply network and close cooperation with numerous logistics service providers. The Connected Supply Chain (CSC) programme significantly increases supply chain transparency. It updates the plants’ material controllers and logistics specialists on the goods’ location and delivery time every 15 minutes. This transparency enables them to respond immediately if delays appear likely and take appropriate steps early to avoid costly extra runs.

Autonomous transport systems both inside and outside

Autonomous transport systems such as tugger trains or Smart Transport Robots are increasingly used to transport goods within production halls.

To allow tugger trains to now also be used for the sophisticated process of supplying assembly lines, as part of a pilot project, BMW Group Plant Dingolfing has developed an automation kit, which enables conventional tugger trains of any brand already on hand to be upgraded to autonomous tugger trains. The capabilities of these driverless tugger trains go beyond automation of earlier solutions.

Another future technology is also being piloted alongside autonomous tugger trains at the Dingolfing plant. A Smart Watch supports logistics staff during the container change process and announces approaching tugger trains via a vibration alarm. The employee can also read which containers should be unloaded and send the tugger train on to its next destination by tapping the display.

The BMW Group is also pioneering the use of autonomous transport systems outdoors. As part of a pilot project, the BMW Group is using an autonomous outdoor transport robot for the first time at its Leipzig plant to bring truck trailers from where they are parked to the unloading and loading bay on their own. A mobile platform drives underneath the trailer, connects it and steers it through the plant. The so-called AutoTrailer, with a payload of up to 30 tons, navigates by laser, without additional guidelines or markings, through the plant’s outdoor areas. Sensors and cameras provide a 360° all-round view, which forms the basis of the safety concept.

The huge potential of this transport system is particularly evident at the BMW Group’s largest plant in Spartanburg, where about 1,200 of these trailer-shunting manoeuvres take place every day.

Back in 2015, the BMW Group joined forces with the Fraunhofer Institute IML to develop the first self-driving Smart Transport Robots (STR) for transporting roll containers through logistics areas within production halls. The second generation is now in operation at BMW Group Plant Regensburg. The flat robots carry roll containers weighing up to one ton and transport them autonomously to where the goods need to be. They calculate the ideal route independently and move freely through space. A built-in battery module from the BMW i3 powers the STR for a whole work shift.

Loading and unloading of goods containers:

Robots take over arduous tasks and relieve staff

After delivery to the plant, the goods are transported to the assembly line in containers and parts containers of various sizes. For the tiring job of reloading containers from pallets onto conveyor belts or into storage, employees will be assisted in the future by logistics robots specially developed for this purpose. Four different types of robots, referred to as ""Bots"" by logistics experts, are currently being tested or have already been integrated into series production.

The lightweight robots take on different jobs: they can take full plastic boxes from the pallet in the incoming goods area and place them on a conveyor system, they do unload tugger trains and place boxes loaded with goods on a shelf, they collect various small parts from appropriate supply racks and they stack empty containers on pallets before they re-enter circulation.

Using artificial intelligence, the robots can detect and process various different containers and determine the ideal grip point.

Smart devices support logistics staff in paperless logistics

Gloves with integrated scanners and displays, data glasses and smart watches are increasingly used to support logistics employees. The transition to paperless logistics, with digitally labelled containers and shelves, opens up new areas of application for mobile devices. Glove scanners read the electronic label and indicate the exact contents of the small load carrier on a small display that can be worn on the arm.

Virtual reality and artificial intelligence

The use of virtual reality already plays an important role in planning logistics spaces. In a virtual environment, planners can quickly and efficiently lay out future logistics areas completely and assess how much space is needed, for instance. Planning is based on 3D data representing the real structures of a logistics hall. For the past several years, the BMW Group has been capturing its plants in digital form with millimetre accuracy, using special 3D scanners and high-resolution cameras. This creates a three-dimensional image of the structures, so that manual recording on site is no longer needed. When planning future logistics areas, BMW Group experts can now combine existing data with a virtual ""library"" of shelves, lattice boxes, small load carriers and around 50 other widely-used operating resources.

Connected Distribution:

Vehicle delivery transparency from plant to showroom

Like delivery of parts to plants, the transport of vehicles to the dealership is now also digitally and transparently traceable. The former Connected Distribution pilot project was fully integrated into series production this year. The system uses the same IT built into BMW Group vehicles to track the location of finished vehicles once they are ready to leave the plant. The vehicle transmits its current geolocation and status to the logistics centre via a mobile connection every time it is switched off.

Focus on sustainability: Natural gas, electric and future hydrogen trucks will reduce CO2 emissions

Logistics can help the BMW Group achieve its sustainability goals. The focus here is on continuous expansion of CO2-efficient modes of transport. More than 60 percent of all new vehicles now leave production plants by rail.

Nevertheless, it is still necessary to use trucks on certain in- and outbound logistics routes. To reduce emissions from these truck journeys, the BMW Group is already using natural gas and electric trucks in cooperation with logistics service providers.

While policy initiatives such as accountable care organizations (ACOs) and bundled payments put hospitals at the center for reorganizing care delivery to address wasteful spending, these early efforts to change the provider business model have seen mixed results on cost savings (and shown a trend toward increasing hospital consolidation and incentivizing higher prices). Yet the organizations whose business models generate profits — for example, through value-added process businesses and integrated delivery systems — will be better positioned to increase efficiency, reduce waste, and thus lower costs. Because integrated delivery systems can capture some of the benefits of new technologies and business models that drive down the price of health care, by moving delivery closer to patients.

This chapter by (now a16z bio partner) Jeffrey Low, M.D., appears in The Business, Policy and Economics of Neurosurgery, and discusses how the current volume-and asset-driven hospital reimbursement model is not sustainable, and how integrated delivery models have (at a regional level so far) and will “disrupt” the hospital system. [The book itself seeks to bridge the gap in medical curricula on discussion of health care economics, health care policy, and the business of medicine (including insurance) as applied in practice by clinical neurosurgeons, in order to help them better treat their patients.]

What is business innovation ? | Definition from TechTarget,https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/business-innovation,N/A,"What is business innovation? Business innovation is an organization's process for introducing new ideas, workflows, methodologies, services or products. Like IT innovation, which calls for using technology in new ways to create a more efficient and agile organization, business innovation should enable the achievement of goals across the entire organization, with sights set on accomplishing core business aims and initiatives. Innovation often begins with idea generation, wherein ideas are narrowed down during brainstorming sessions, after which leaders consider the business viability, feasibility and desirability of each idea. Business innovation should improve on existing products, services or processes, solve a problem or reach new customers. Recent examples of business innovation include the Dyson vacuum cleaner, whose creator and namesake James Dyson declared in advertisements that he set out to build a better product by applying industrial cyclone technologies to the household appliance. Ride-sharing companies, such as Zipcar, Uber and Lyft, represent an example of a service innovation. Gillette has billed its Mach3 razors as containing innovative technology.

Why business innovation is important The purpose of the business innovation process is to create value for the organization. That value can come from the following areas: Creating new revenue opportunities or driving more revenue through existing channels.

Creating efficiencies that save time, money or both.

Creating improvements to productivity or performance. In short, innovation should lead to higher profits. Additionally, the results of an organization's innovation process should yield a competitive advantage; it should help the organization to grow and reach -- or, better still, exceed -- strategic objectives.

Innovation vs. invention Innovation and invention are closely linked, but the two terms are not interchangeable. An invention is an entirely new creation. The process of business innovation can produce an invention. However, the term is broader in scope and includes the application of an existing concept or practice in a new way or applying new technology to an existing product or process to improve upon it. To better understand the difference, consider this: The telephone is an invention, but the smartphone is an innovation.

The business innovation cycle Although there's no one-size-fits-all formula for business innovation, organizations that are continually successful at business innovation have a repeatable process to generate, test and develop ideas that can lead to innovations. The cycle is often broken down into four parts. It starts with articulating ideas around key areas, such as business models, marketing, processes, products and services. The cycle moves through discovery then onto development and delivery. The first phase focuses on the creation and recording of ideas as well as the preliminary evaluation of whether those ideas could produce value. The next phase centers on testing the ideas through pilot programs or proof of concept, during which ideas and their value are further evaluated. The last two phases center on scaling ideas, moving them into production and integrating them into normal business operations. Business leaders often use different names for each of these phases. For example, some label the first phase ideation and the last phase implementation, but the steps for each phase are basically the same. A look at the four primary steps of innovation in business. Some executives and managers further break down the cycle into even more phases, separating items such as analysis, testing and review as separate steps.

Models of innovation Business innovation can be grouped into various categories, or models. Some are self-explanatory, such as product or process innovations. Other types, and what they mean, include the following: Business model innovation: the development and implementation of new, unique concepts supporting an organization's financial viability, including its mission.

Industry model innovation: the creation of a new industry or an organization's move into a new industry.

Revenue model innovation: improvements and/or changes to an organization's framework for generating revenue, a goal also encompassed by the term, business model innovation.

Revolutionary vs. evolutionary Business innovation can also be classified as either revolutionary or evolutionary. Revolutionary business innovation yields a drastic change in a product, service, process, etc., which often destroys or supplants an existing business model. This is also known as radical innovation. Evolutionary or incremental innovation involves smaller, more continuous improvements that, while important, are not drastic enough to shift a company or market into a new paradigm. Disruptive innovation is a category that emphasizes the destructive aspect of revolutionary innovation; this term applies to business innovation that leads to the creation of a new market that displaces an existing one or, similarly, a significant upheaval in a category of products or services.",innovative freight processing technologies

Putting digital process innovation at the center of ...,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/putting-digital-process-innovation-at-the-center-of-organizational-change,N/A,"When it comes to mergers, acquisitions, or divestitures, IT professionals are necessarily focused on the immediate tasks of streamlining unwieldy IT systems; given the complexity and sheer size of the integration task, they must be selective about what projects and changes they can tackle within the first 100 days. That shouldnât preclude them, however, from looking a bit further ahead in the integration schedule and identifying how the business could eventually revamp its processes in ways that can create significant long-term value.

IT organizationsâ initial reaction to mergers and acquisitions has typically been to reduce the scope of change where possible, weather the storm, and resolve as many technical issues as possible by announced âgo liveâ dates. They have tended to focus on maintaining what is thereâprimarily, costly legacy systems that add a complexity tax to every business activity undertaken. The organization can become mired in a long, frustrating integration process that yields only some (or even none) of the intended benefits of the acquisition or merger.

Instead, IT leaders should take the time to reconsider their IT architectures in the broader context, considering not just the requirements for the first 100 days of the merger but also the potential efficiencies the company may gain over time from digitization as well as the technical solutions the business needs to meet its efficiency objectives. Indeed, IT leaders should systematically review their options for building a more agile frame around existing and acquired systems. A focus on the implementation of new or enhanced technology-enabled ways of workingâor digital process innovationâcan help companies simplify the technology landscape, reduce overall IT costs, and bring products and services to market quicker, thereby realizing greater earnings potential.

In this article, we present a three-point framework for encouraging the pursuit of digitization during M&A transitionsânamely, by performing end-to-end mapping of business activities, assessing and improving data management and analytics expertise, and exploring new organizational roles and operating models. To help illustrate how these activities may be carried out, we consider the potential effects of introducing digital processes in a consolidating pharmaceutical and medical-device market. In our experience, however, the framework discussed here can be applied in companies in any industry facing M&A opportunities and integration decisions.

Potential impact of digital process innovation

Our research indicates that introducing digital processes and capabilities throughout a company can facilitate acquisitions, mergers, or divestitures. Consider the market for pharmaceuticals and medical products; the average value of M&A deals in this industry is rising as more companies seek to streamline their R&D, supply-chain, sales, and marketing operations while still increasing market share (Exhibit 1). However, in this industry and others, successful deals have been hindered by poor cultural fit, poor or slow execution, lack of adequate planning, and a limited understanding of the technologies and digital capabilities each side brings to the table.

1

One medical-device manufacturer, for instance, acquired a start-up firm, seeking to capitalize on the smaller firmâs expertise in technologies for creating digital services for customers. The device manufacturer announced the acquisition and quickly entered into a multiyear rebuilding project. While the integration period was under way, dynamics in the healthcare market continued to change, and by the end of what turned out to be an extended transformation period, the IT goals the company had set at the beginning now seemed outdated given emerging tools and technologies. Rather than capture the full value intended from the deal, the company was facing significant cost overruns and was lagging competitors.

Our research and industry analyses indicate that acquiring companies can increase their revenue from R&D efforts by up to 25 percent when they and their targets can jointly take advantage of digital processes that are enabled by big data and advanced analytics to unearth innovative ideas, make product-development decisions, and collaborate more effectively. They could also increase their revenue from sales and marketing initiatives by launching new or shared digital sales channels. And they could realize a 5 percent increase in revenue attributed to operations by using virtualization, automation, and other digital technologies to create end-to-end visibility and management of supply-chain functionsâfrom warehouse to shipping to delivery.

Enabling digital process innovation

Digitization requires a two-speed architecture A dual-speed IT architecture is a prerequisite for digital process innovation. It decouples the management of slower legacy systems on the back end from the development of faster customer-facing applications on the front end. And it allows IT organizations to release innovative digital products and services to customers more frequently without compromising the maintenance and stability of back-end systems. To implement a two-speed approach, companies first need to consider how their front-end software is developed and deployedâemphasizing cocreation by IT staffers and the business units. Rather than perpetuate a system where business units throw their software requirements over the wall to IT, companies can establish new work flows whereby representatives from each group collaborate in small cross-functional teams to develop new prototypes as well as frequent updates to existing software. Companies may also want to explore cloud-based infrastructures that can speed up this development process and facilitate sharing. A move toward two-speed architecture can take time but even a gradual shift to this model can help companies digitize business processes at a relatively quick pace. The period just before or just after an announced merger or acquisition provides an ideal opportunity for companies to look at their existing IT architectures and consider whether there is a significant gap between back-end and front-end processes, and how best to close that gap.

There are three critical actions organizations can take to encourage digital process innovation: map and then streamline select end-to-end business activities, get a clear view of how information and data are managed across the parent and target companies, and reconsider the organizational structure and operating model. Underlying all of these actions is the need for a dual-speed IT architectureâone that preserves existing legacy systems on the back end but also enables quick development of innovative customer-facing applications on the front end (see sidebar, âDigitization requires a two-speed architectureâ).

Would you like to learn more about our Business Technology Practice?

Streamline select end-to-end processes

In the wake of an announced merger, IT executives should make system optimization decisions that go beyond planning for the go-live date. They should begin to consider which end-to-end processes in both the parent and target companiesâfor instance, procurement to payment, order to cash, and record to reportâwould benefit most from streamlining through digitization. They should categorize the applications associated with these processes and determine which technology capabilities and areas of expertise they still need to develop.

Assess business processes. The first step is to identify the companyâs highest-level business processes to determine where there are standardization opportunities across business units, geographies, and product categories. The medical-device manufacturer mentioned earlier had targeted its R&D processes for reinvention; with the acquisition of the small start-up, the company wanted to launch products more quickly and incorporate customer feedback into the development process. IT executives sought to engage multidisciplinary teams that could quickly integrate new technologies (Internet of Things, 3-D printing, and so on) into the organization. This meant creating new, more agile ways of working.

A mapping exercise can help companies see process flows across business functions and spot any gaps in their technology capabilities. Organizations that prioritize supply-chain operations, for instance, may clearly see a need to introduce automation technologies to facilitate their sales and distribution planning as well as their transportation and warehousing activitiesâfor instance, automating the collection and analysis of data to identify which size trucks are required for certain deliveries, where particular items are stored within a warehouse, and what the best storage options are. Or, they may seek to build up their expertise in advanced (and sometimes proprietary) analytics and algorithms to aid demand managementâfor example, generating sales forecasts and identifying purchase patterns. In those business functions in which a companyâs technology capabilities are more advanced, there may be opportunities to cut costs through standardizationâfor instance, there may be redundant processes being used within supply-chain and finance functions.

Assess business applications. The second step is for companies to evaluate their software applicationsâthose of the target company as well as those of the acquiring firm. Mapping these applications to individual activities, within different business functions and divisions, allows IT executives to easily spot overlaps and redundancies in their application portfolios. One planning application, for instance, might be relevant across a number of functional areas while another may be relevant only for transportation planning or only for inventory planning (Exhibit 2). The period just before or just after the announcement of a merger is a good time to take this inventory; both companies have an opportunity to determine how to reconcile and simplify their individual IT landscapes before figuring out how to actually make them work together. Indeed, applications should not be modified, retired, or rationalized without a full understanding of why the companiesâ IT architectures are configured the way they are. To that end, IT organizations on both sides of the deal will need to capture relevant information about their applications, such as total number of apps, total cost of ownership, usage metrics, and application ownership (which divisions in which locations). Most critical is maintaining a single, consolidated view of this information.

Get a clear view of how information and data are managed

To ensure that everyone has access to the information required to pursue digital process innovations, companies must establish a single system of record across all functions, divisions, and geographies. The system must comprise all relevant dataâfor instance, sales, inventory, and procurement recordsâplus the latest analytics tools and a reliable global delivery service, all maintained by a dedicated team of knowledge professionals. The medical-devices company, for example, created a center of excellence for data management, which included representatives from the business units and the IT organization. The company also hired analytics experts to provide an empirical perspective on which data should be collected, how they should be collected and disseminated, and how databases should be curated and managed over time. From a hardware standpoint, organizations will likely need to repurpose their existing data-management systems, pursue standardization options where appropriate, and develop a rigorous strategy for creating, using, and storing data as well as related governance policies. Again, a steering committee or center of excellence can play a central role in setting these policies.

Reconsider the organizational structure and operating model

It will be critical for companies seeking to digitize select processes to create a new management structure and operating model with several new roles. The most critical role is the global process manager or global process owner. This individual will be charged with overseeing process standardization across divisions, regions, countries, and product lines. He or she will be well positioned to provide an end-to-end view of digital processes and a framework for the implementation of any new step changes. He or she will also work closely with business and IT leaders, and division-specific program managers to understand âlocalâ needs as well as âglobalâ needs. Indeed, the medical-products manufacturer we described earlier ended up creating two other management positions to collaborate with its newly appointed global process manager. The business-relationship manager acts as a liaison between the IT organization and the business side and is charged primarily with defining potential digital process innovations at the division level. The IT-delivery leader is focused on execution; he is responsible for ensuring that any process innovations are properly rolled out across the organization.

To incorporate digital process innovation into their operations, IT executives will need to change some of the prevailing behaviors and mind-sets in their companies. Apart from creating a snapshot of current technology capabilities, IT executives will need to get buy-in for digital process innovations from the business side; they will need to demonstrate how the pursuit of new, technology-enabled ways of working is in direct service to desired business outcomes. As mentioned earlier, they may need to configure teams differentlyânot just by creating new roles, such as the global process manager, but also by reimagining existing roles in business, IT, and product-development functions. Above all else, transparency is requiredâamong team members and in all the data captured and reported.

The companies that can look beyond the first 100 days of an announced merger or acquisition, when everything in the IT architecture is up for discussion and refinement, have an opportunity to realize significant, lasting value for the organization.",innovative freight processing technologies
Netflix Innovation Strategy: Process & Product | Vaia,https://www.vaia.com/en-us/explanations/business-studies/business-case-studies/netflix-innovation-strategy/,N/A,"- Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix Let's take a look at how Netflix manages to stay one of the most innovative companies by pursuing an innovation-focused strategic direction in addition to a variety of innovation strategies.

Introduction to Netflix Netflix Inc. is an American subscription-based video streaming platform. The platform is used internationally to stream movies and TV shows from numerous different countries and genres. Other than operating as a streaming service, Netflix is also a production company producing movies and television series under the Netflix Originals brand name. Netflix is available in 190 countries, in 30 different languages, and oftentimes the movies and shows available to stream will differ based on your location. The cost of a subscription to the platform also varies depending on the customer's location and the amount they wish to use the service. The company's mission is to 'entertain the world'. At Netflix, we want to entertain the world. Whatever your taste, and no matter where you live, we give you access to best-in-class TV shows, movies, and documentaries. Our members control what they want to watch, when they want it, with no ads, in one simple subscription…We are the world's biggest fans of entertainment, and we're always looking to help you find your next favorite story.” Netflix originally started as a DVD rental company that, over the years, through technological advances, turned into the streaming platform it is today. Let's examine how Netflix has managed to become one of the most widely used movie and video streaming platforms through its innovative strategy.

Netflix innovation strategy Innovation strategy refers to a company's plan on how it will achieve its objectives, such as increasing profits or market share through the innovation of products or processes. The Netflix innovation strategy focuses on maximizing its competitive advantage through its product and process innovations. The innovations are aimed at making the Netflix streaming service high quality and accessible for the majority of consumers. Netflix aims to achieve this by always looking for ways to make operations more cost-effective so that the majority of consumers are able to afford the subscription price.

Strategic direction to achieve innovation A strategic direction is a set of activities and decisions that a firm must make to accomplish its goals and objectives. In order to understand Netflix's innovation strategy and process, we need to understand the strategic direction that the company followed to achieve its innovations. Prior to that, it is important that we understand the key actions that contribute to forming a strategic direction. Firstly, a business needs to be aware of its overall purpose. This can be in the form of a business vision or mission. For example, it can be becoming a market leader or creating innovations that will improve the lives of consumers. Secondly, business needs to make a plan on how they are going to achieve their goal. This may involve setting a plan that includes decisions and activities that will assist in achieving the overall business's purpose. Now let's have a look at an example of strategic direction so that later we can apply it to the Netflix case. Firstly, let's assume that the business's goal is to be a profitable company. Currently, there is a market for products however the business spends a lot of time and money on production, which leaves the business with a low profit margin. The business's strategic aim would be to lower the costs of production by investing in new technology, this strategic direction must be supported by the market research to ensure that this technology is effective and improves production efficiency.

Strategic direction matrix Another effective way to assist companies in setting strategic direction is making a strategic direction matrix. There are two main types of matrices: Outsourcing matrix - An important part of this matrix is to assist the company in deciding whether they should outsource some of their organizational tasks or keep them in-house. The matrix analyzes each of the main operational tasks and assesses which ones would be more beneficial for the organization to outsource and which ones would be better to be done by the company. Ansoff matrix - This matrix assists companies in forming their growth strategy, by analyzing various scenarios. For example, the Ansoff matrix can help a business decide if it would be more profitable for the company to increase sales in the existing market or enter a new market and develop new products. To find out more about the business's strategic direction, take a look at our explanations on Strategic Direction.

Netflix Product Innovation To further understand the company's innovation strategy, we will examine its operations and product offerings throughout the years. In 1997, the founders of Netflix had an idea to rent DVDs by mail and tested out whether the idea would physically work. They sent a DVD in the mail and once it arrived intact, the company was born. A year later they launched the netflix.com website where customers could rent DVDs which would then be mailed to their house. This is an example of disruptive innovation that the company undertook, as the company developed a completely new service that added significant value to customers. As a reminder on the different types of innovation in business, check out our explanation called assessing innovation. In the following year, the company developed a subscription service whereby customers could rent an unlimited number of DVDs per month. Shortly after, the company introduced an algorithm that assessed customers' previous ratings of movies they have watched to predict which movies they would choose to watch and rate highly in the future. These two steps in Netflix's development represent a form of product innovation , as they introduced two new options that added value to customers and increased the quality of the user experience. In 2003, the company announced that there are over 1 million Netflix subscribers. To protect its innovation and intellectual property, the company issued a patent for its subscription rental services. In 2007, the company introduced streaming which allowed its customers to watch movies and series instantly (rather than waiting for the rental DVD to arrive). This was one of the most significant innovations from both the product and the process point of view, as well as another example of disruptive innovation. Moving the rental platform online allowed customer experience with the company to increase as it completely eliminated the waiting time to watch a movie or show. It also allowed the customer to stream wherever they wanted (within their region) and allowed for more freedom of choice in entertainment. The customer could start watching a movie and if they didn't like it change to another movie instantly, rather than waiting for a different DVD to arrive. From a process point of view, the innovation started making Netflix's operations more streamlined . The company initially had to spend less time on shipping products (DVDs), packaging costs eventually became obsolete and the company no longer had to store inventory, making distribution and overall physical operations more efficient. Product innovation refers to when a company creates products or services that have not been previously available or existed. Process innovation refers to improvements that are made to existing processes to increase business efficiency. Study tip: to find out more about the different factors that determine a company's operations, take a look at our explanations on operations management. As seen throughout the service and product innovation process, the strategic direction that Netflix took was to innovate its service, to achieve their overall purpose of making it convenient and accessible for consumers to watch TV shows, movies etc. At first Netflix was an online DVD renting service and although it was convenient, consumers had to wait a while for their DVDs to arrive to watch their requested content. To achieve the set goal, the activities and decisions that were involved were to transform Netflix into an online video streamlining platform so that consumers could watch their chosen content instantly instead of waiting for DVDs to arrive.

Netflix disruptive innovation Disruptive innovation refers to a change in the availability of services that were previously expensive and only available to a select group of highly-skilled consumers, becoming accessible to a wider audience. In Netflix's case, the disruptive innovation was from the start by introducing the DVD rental service, which allowed customers to get their DVDs mailed to their house. Later, in 2007, Netflix transformed from an online DVD rental company by mail to an online entertainment streaming platform, which is the biggest disruptive innovation that Netflix implemented. Due to this innovation, rather than renting DVDs individually, consumers could subscribe to Netflix online and access all the content. Moreover, this innovation not only made TV shows, movies etc. more comfortable to watch for consumers but also lowered Netflix's cost of production, which lowered the prices of the service. This innovation made Netflix's cost lower, therefore, more accessible and affordable for the majority of consumers. Moreover, to make services cheaper and have a broader variety of content, Netflix outsources the production of most TV shows, movies, etc, however, in recent years Netflix has been producing more of its original content. If we look at the strategic direction analysis we can see that according to the outsourcing matrix, Netflix had made a decision that for the company it may be cheaper to outsource the TV shows and movies as it is more beneficial to the company rather than producing them all in house Moreover , if we take a look at the Ansoff matrix we can see that Netflix set a strategic direction to achieve its growth by product innovation. This was done by introducing a new service product of an online video streaming platform available to consumers through subscription. This helped Netflix in achieving its growth, as more users were reached globally.

Netflix innovation process An innovation process refers to a process of starting from an idea and translating it into a market solution. Moreover, the continuous innovation process describes constant improvements (incremental innovations) that are added to an existing product or service. In this section, we will cover the continuous innovation process of Netflix, which is illustrated as an innovation timeline, as seen in Figure 1. Figure 1. Netflix Innovation Process, Vaia

Netflix innovation process timeline This innovation process timeline shows how the Netflix service product was improved by incremental innovation and completely transformed through radical innovation . 1. Netflix started as a DVD start-up where the idea was to make the process of renting movies more convenient to the consumers. The concept was that consumers would order a DVD to rent through the internet and get it delivered to their doorstep. This was a product/radical innovation as this service did not exist before. 2. Netflix noticed that the DVD renting service that involved a process of paying for each rented DVD was quite uncomfortable as consumers had to pay each time they order a DVD. In order to resolve this problem, Netflix has introduced a subscription model, which allows subscribers to take advantage of the service as frequently as they like, without having to pay for each DVD rental. 3. The introduction of Netflix Queue in 2000 was an innovation that improved the experience for many. Consumers had the option of selecting a list of movies, TV shows, etc that they would like mailed to them after they have finished watching a DVD. This way consumers did not have to spend time and effort selecting what they would like to watch next. 4. In 2003 Netflix received a patent that allowed it to protect its intellectual property and its users' data regarding renting DVDs, as well as to manage other aspects of the business to make it safe. The patent is another example of Netflix's incremental innovation that improved the company's service security. 5. The video recommendations algorithm is another innovation that has improved the Netflix service significantly. The subscription model that was introduced earlier has helped this innovation to thrive, as Netflix was able to make personalized recommendations to customers, based on their watching history and the ratings of movies, TV shows, etc from previous customers. 6. The biggest radical innovation of Netflix is when Netflix transformed from a DVD rental service into an online streaming platform. This means that customers no longer had to wait for their DVD to be delivered, as they were now able to watch Netflix content through its online streaming platform. This has increased the consumer base, which leads to Netflix becoming the most-visited internet website during non-working hours. 7. Netflix increased their selection of entertainment by producing original content referred to as 'Netflix originals'. This new improvement to the service made Netflix seem original and exclusive as the Netflix original movies, TV shows, series, etc cannot be watched anywhere else. Incremental innovations refer to small improvements made to an existing product or a service whereas radical innovation refers to creating a new invention that did not exist previously.

Pros and cons of Netflix innovation strategy The innovation strategy that Netflix pursues is gaining a competitive advantage through producing high-quality content and being accessible to a majority of people. Now let's have a look at the pros and cons of this innovation strategy.

Pros of Netflix innovation strategy Simple to use – The innovation strategy of making it accessible for the majority, means that Netflix develops its service in a way that is easy and simple for everyone to use. To use this platform users do not need to download additional software, they can simply access it through the web or an app on a phone, tablet or computer. Affordable –The Netflix service is affordable to a majority of the public costing only £5.99 to £13.99 per month, depending on the subscription package that users choose to use. The innovation strategy of cutting costs where possible allows Netflix to be able to offer these low monthly costs to its consumers as well as giving a 1-month free trial. Available offline – As part of Netflix's strategy to make itself accessible to most users, Netflix now allows consumers who previously downloaded content to watch Netflix via offline mode. Offers original content – In order to produce high-quality content, Netflix creates original content that cannot be found anywhere else, making Netflix original and exclusive. This gives Netflix a competitive advantage over other streaming websites.",innovative freight processing technologies

More than 80 highly skilled jobs in Greater Lafayette region

Evonik, one of the world's leading providers of drug delivery technologies, broke ground on its $220 million global-scale production facility for pharmaceutical lipids in Lafayette, Indiana. Representatives of the federal government, the state government as well as local officials joined Evonik’s CEO Christian Kullmann and members of the company’s Executive and Supervisory Boards for the groundbreaking ceremony at Evonik’s Tippecanoe Laboratories.

“Our new Lipid Innovation Center will secure the health innovations of tomorrow. Through this investment we reinforce our leading position in the pharmaceutical industry. We are privileged to support the U.S. with pandemic preparedness and enable the development of cutting-edge medicines,” said Christian Kullmann, CEO of Evonik.

Evonik’s Lipid Innovation Center is being built on the grounds of the company’s site in Tippecanoe and will position Evonik for future growth in novel mRNA-based therapies beyond COVID-19 vaccines. The investment into the lipid facility will help create more than 80 highly skilled jobs in the Greater Lafayette region. An additional 300 contractor positions will be added over the project life cycle. Production is scheduled to start in 2025.

“Evonik’s decision to build this new facility, and add 80 high-paying jobs, in Indiana is reflective of our state’s highly trained workforce and the business-friendly environment we have worked to create,” said Indiana Governor Eric J. Holcomb. “We are proud to support this life science related project.”

The Lafayette-based site is preferred due to its existing infrastructure, skilled workforce, and readily available technologies. Evonik currently employs nearly 680 people at its Tippecanoe site – plus an additional 150 contractors that assist with maintenance and logistics. The facility is one of the world’s largest contract manufacturing facilities for active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and Evonik's second-largest site in the U.S.

The total investment into the commercial-scale lipid facility amounts to $220 million. The U.S. government has entered a cooperative agreement with Evonik for a cost share of up to $150 million through its Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA), a component of the Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response (ASPR) in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). BARDA promotes the advanced development of medical countermeasures to respond to 21st century health security threats and coordinated acquisition assistance with the Department of Defense (DOD) Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear Defense (JPEO-CBRND). Additional support comes from the Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC), Greater Lafayette Commerce (GLC), and Duke Energy.

“Evonik’s strategic expansion at Tippecanoe is fantastic news for the entire Greater Lafayette region,” said Scott Walker, president, and CEO of Greater Lafayette Commerce. “The Town of Shadeland, Lafayette, West Lafayette, Tippecanoe County, the Purdue Research Foundation, and Greater Lafayette Commerce all supported this effort and not only look forward to the high-value jobs it will create, but also the important role the new Lipid Innovation Center will play in our nation’s vaccine preparedness.”

2021-03-01

Toyota Tsusho Corporation (""Toyota Tsusho"")and Kwansei Gakuin University have succeeded in developing ""Dynamic AGE-ingÂ®"", a process technology for controlling the arrangements of atoms on the surface of substrates at the nanometer level to neutralize defects* in SiC (silicon carbide) substrates, a next-generation power semiconductor material.



With performance tests on 6-inch SiC substrates completed, this highly innovative technology will simultaneously achieve both high quality and better productivity for SiC substrates. SiC substrates will play a major role in our decarbonized society of the future, as we expect these substrates to see a great increase in demand in a wide variety of areas, such as the global automotive industry currently undergoing a rapid change to produce electric vehicles.



We will start providing samples to semiconductor device manufacturers, as well as verify our technology to enable its use into mass production lines. In addition, we will advance our development to apply our technology to large diameter, 8-inch SiC substrates, which are expected to be in widespread use in the future.

1. Background

Compared to the widely used power semiconductor material Si (silicon), SiC can significantly minimize power loss, thereby allowing more effective use of power and making cooling solutions more compact. SiC devices are starting to be applied to areas where green innovation is spreading, such as the automotive, rail, industrial equipment, and power industry, where devices having mid-to-high withstanding voltages are needed. In particular, there is a great demand to apply these devices to EVs, HVs, and FCVs; a huge increase in demand is forecasted within the auto industry in Japan as well as overseas.



To manufacture highly reliable power semiconductors at low cost, it is imperative that high quality, large diameter, SiC substrates are provided stably. However, conventional SiC substrates had issues in that crystals deformed during machine processing (processing deformation layer) or intrinsic defects, i.e., Basal Plane Dislocations (BPD), can cause the performance of power semiconductors formed above these defects to degrade significantly.

2. The Effects of ""Dynamic AGE-ingÂ®""

Toyota Tsusho and Kwansei Gakuin University (Professor Tadaaki Kaneko, School of Engineering) have jointly developed a unique technology called âDynamic AGE-ingÂ®â. Unlike the conventional machine processing, this is a contactless process technology integrating thermal etching and crystal growth, allowing control at the nanometer level. By placing the SiC substrate under a gas phase environment with extremely high temperatures, the atoms on the surface of the substrate are autonomously arranged, thereby wholly eliminating the process deformation layer as well as neutralizing the harmful effects of BPD by blocking its extension (see Figure 1). Applying ""Dynamic AGE-ingÂ®"" will improve the quality of SiC substrates regardless of its manufacturer or size. In addition, this technology will simplify the substrate manufacturing process and improve its yield, which in turn will improve the productivity of SiC substrates (see Figure 2).

3. Development through Open Innovation

Toyota Tsusho and Kwansei Gakuin University utilize both SiC-related technology Kwansei Gakuin University nurtured for the past 20 years and the extensive business connections Toyota Tsusho cultivated to advance technological development and its practice through open innovation, allowing a wide range of user companies and manufacturers to participate in these activities.

4. Future Development of Dynamic AGE-ingÂ® for Practical Use

Toyota Tsusho and Kwansei Gakuin University will start supplying SiC substrate samples applied with Dynamic AGE-ingÂ® from the first half of fiscal year 2021, as well as collaborate with semiconductor device manufacturers to verify the technology into use in the field. To provide high quality, competitive 6-inch SiC substrates to various user companies, mainly those in the automotive industry, we will ask a wide range of business partners to participate with us, to ensure our technology is swiftly adopted to mass production. Further, we will accelerate our development to apply the âDynamic AGE-ingÂ®â to large-diameter, 8-inch SiC substrates.

Zero-Emission Shipping,https://mission-innovation.net/missions/shipping/,N/A,"Zero-Emission Shipping

Our goal is to demonstrate commercially-viable zero-emission ships by 2030, making vessels that operate on zero-emission fuels the natural choice for ship owners when they renew their fleet. International shipping transports the majority of the world’s goods and is responsible for 3% of global emissions, potentially increasing by half by 2050 on its current trajectory. To set international shipping on an ambitious zero-emission trajectory, we need commercially viable, zero-emission ocean-going vessels in the global fleet by 2030.

The Plan

Coordinated innovation needs to take place across the entire maritime value chain, from the ships to the future zero-emission fuels they will rely on, and the infrastructure that will supply them. This will drive the sector to a tipping point in its transition to well-to-wake zero-emission fuels as soon as possible. The Mission will focus on the following three areas to achieve the goal:

Ships Fuels Fuelling Infrastructure

Ships Goal: 600 large ships in international shipping are running on well-wake zero-emission fuel by 2030.

Projects

Fuels Goal: Enable the production 16 Mt of heavy fuel oil equivalent (HFOe) well-to-wake zero-emission fuels by 2030.

Projects

Fueling Infrastructure Goal: 20 key ports covering at least three continents offering well-to-wake zero-emission bunkering by 2030.

Automation in cargo loading/unloading processes: do ...,https://jshippingandtrade.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41072-023-00146-9,N/A,"The model always retains the use of forklift trucks as a reference scenario and relates the costs of other technologies to it. The tool makes a difference between the cumulated costs of using the new ALUT and the cost of using forklifts.

Main results

The following results are obtained referring to an average-size warehouse. The operational characteristics of this warehouse and the framework of this empirical analysis are presented in “Appendix 2”. Moreover, the cost elements generated by each technology purchase are shown in “Appendix 3”.

Purchase costs

This section gives a more detailed approach on the purchase cost of ALUT. Figure 3 compares the purchase costs between the analysed technologies, while Fig. 4 shows their cost structure.

Fig. 4 Purchase cost for each technology type Full size image

From the Fig. 3 it can be concluded that the use of forklifts generates the lowest purchase cost and appears the best technology to be chosen based on these criteria alone. The loading plate and the transport belt technologies generate comparable purchase cost, though these costs are higher than the use of forklifts. From Fig. 3 can be also observed that the Skate + system generates a relatively high purchase cost, almost 4 times higher than the use of forklifts making this technology unattractive to punchers in a first place.Footnote 1 Triggered by these results, Fig. 4 gives more details regarding the structure of purchase costs for loading/unloading technologies.

Figure 4 shows that the main cost component for loading technologies is the acquisition cost of the equipment. Besides this cost, other costs are also incurred. The purchase of forklifts is quite straightforward and does not generate other type of costs than risks. The same type of costs is also incurred if other technologies are purchased. It is noticeable that the Loading plate and Transport belt generate noticeable indirect costs. These costs are usually associated with the need for extra adaptations to the warehouse to enable this technology's use. Moreover, the purchase of the Transport belt carries a relatively high cost to 3rd parties. This cost is generated by the custom adaptations necessary to be made to trailers. This type of cost is expected to be covered by the warehouse by either directly covering this custom adaptation work or being required to pay relatively higher transport fees to road carriers that own these custom trailers. For the Skate + technology, the extra cost besides the equipment’s acquisition is relatively low.

Triggered by these results, a further step is taken in this research and an in-depth operational cost analysis is made. The following section details these results and analyses the results further from this perspective.

Operational cost

This section details the results regarding the operation cost generated by each technology. Figure 5 compares the average cost per pallet for the handling operations. This figure splits these costs according to the loading operation, and the operations taken to prepare and unload the load. In addition, Fig. 6 shows results with concerning the cost structure for using each of the analysed technologies. These results are obtained based on estimations provided in the specifications sheets of each technology type.

Fig. 5 Purchase cost structure Full size image

Fig. 6 Operational cost generated by each technology Full size image

Figure 5 visualises a comparison between the operational costs generated by each technology. This figure shows that using the transport belt as automatic loading/unloading generates the lowest operational cost. The cost of loading is around 0.14 EUR/pallet when this technology is used, while the other technologies generate higher average costs. This results from the possibility enabled by this technology to shift the entire load of pallets into the truck in one move, during a relative short amount of time and with the involvement of one operator. The use of the Skate + system and the forklift, generate equal operational costs, but both are higher than the use of the transport belt. This results from a relative longer amount of time necessary to retract the loading boards for the Skate + system from beneath the pallets or to handle pallets one-by-one when forklifts are in use for the unloading operations. The Loading plate technology generates the highest operational loading cost. In this case, this operation is done at a low speed. The low speed is necessary to drop the pallets on the trailer's bed without extra damages.

Looking at the operational cost of preparing the load, it is observed that the use of forklifts generates the lowest cost. The activities taken to prepare the load are longer when other technologies are used. If automatic loading technologies are in use, the pallets need to be fixed on either a loading plate or skates, which require sometime slight adjustments. The results regarding the unloading operation show that the loading plate generates the lowest average cost. When this technology is in use, the pallets are finely aligned in the trailer enabling an unloading process that is more accurate and faster. The use of forklift generates the highest costs here. This activity requires the involvement of forklift operators that handle each pallet individually from the position inside the trailer to the unloading bay, which are costly.

Based on these results, it is obvious that using the transport belt generates the lowest operation cost. Triggered by these results a further look is taken at the cost structure for each technology. Figure 6 present the results regarding the percentage of each type of cost that composes the operational cost.

Figure 6 details the cost structure and the components of the operation cost. In this figure, it is observed that employee cost is the main cost category for each technology. The use of the Loading plate and the Skate + systems generated the highest cost associated with fuel or energy. These types of technologies rely on skidding the loading plates or moving components, which results in relative higher energy use. The use of forklifts also generates costs associated with faults or delays. The manual and individual handling of pallets with forklifts generate these types of costs. The automatic loading/unloading technologies benefit from advanced scanning systems that eliminate this type of costs. The cost associated with accidents are present in the same percentage across the technologies. It is also noticed that the damage costs are higher in case a Transport belt is used. The use of Transport belt sets relative higher mechanical stress on the loading units, sometimes leading to their failure.

The following section details the results concerning cost calculation when both operational and purchase costs are considered.

Total cost (operational and purchase costs)

The individual results regarding the operational and purchase type of costs indicate different technology as the best solution for loading/unloading operations. Decision-makers giving the most importance to one or another criterion reach thus to different results. This section makes an extra step in this analysis and, using the calculation tool developed, provides other effects concerning the total costs generated by each technology after 10 years. This calculation incorporates the cost associated with the operation and purchase of ALUT. Figure 7 details the percentages of these costs that contribute to the total costs. Later, Fig. 8 compares the total prices generated by each ALUT after an exploitation time of 10 years.

Fig. 7 Cost structure of the operational costs Full size image

Fig. 8 Total cost structure (purchase and operational) for implementing each technology Full size image

As seen in Fig. 7 above, the Skate + system carries the highest share of purchase costs in their cost structure. This technology's purchase cost was shown as the highest in the section above. The loading plate and transport belt systems appear to have similar cost structures. Yet, the use of forklifts has the lowest percentage of the purchase cost in its cost structure. Figure 8 compares the ALUT analysed from the perspective of absolute total costs.

Figure 8 shows that the transport belt is the most economically advantageous solution for loading/unloading operations, while the Skate + system is the most expensive. The use of Loading plate and Forklifts generate higher total costs than the use of transport belt after 10 years. The operating cost for these technologies is expected to be higher due to the involvement of human operators. The purchase of a forklift, although cheaper, it generates higher operational costs for the same reason. The graph in Fig. 9 shows the cost evolution for these analysed technologies.

Fig. 9 Total cost generated by each technology after a period of 10 years Full size image

Figure 10 shows the cumulated cost for each analysed technology over a period of 10 years. As seen in this figure, the cost of using forklifts is low in the first year. The Loading plate, Transport belt, and Skate + systems generate higher purchase costs and thus create higher total costs in the first period of operation. After 10 years, the cost of purchasing forklifts adds up with the cost of operating them, resulting in a much higher total cost generated by this technology. The cost of using a Transport belt is the lowest after 10 years of exploitation, followed by the cost of using a Loading plate. The cost of using the Skate + technology is always higher than the cost of purchasing and operating any other technology. Table 4 below provides further results assuming using forklifts as reference technology. These results show each technology's return on investment (RoI) and the break-even period.

Table 4 Results with regard to the RoI and break-even period Full size table

Fig. 10 Evolution of the cumulated cost for each technology Full size image

According to the results in Table 5, it can be observed that the Transport belt technology offers the highest RoI. After 10 years, using a Transport belt generates costs that are 11% lower than forklifts. The same conclusion is also made when loading plates are in use, which generates costs that are 4% lower. As could be anticipated from previous results, the Skate + technology does not lead to a positive RoI. Moreover, by using the Transport belt, the users can reach break-even after 3 years, 1 month, 3 years, and 8 months respectively, in case of choosing to purchase the Loading plate technology.

Table 5 Results associated with changes in the input elements Full size table

The results presented above are valid for the initial input of data valid for a mid-size warehouse. However, these input data can vary. The following section presents a scenario analysis for variations of the key input data.

Scenarios analysis regarding the RoI

The key input data could change, therefore the results of an analysis. This section uses the input received in the validation meeting and varies key input data to show further results. Results from the perspective of RoI and the break-even period are provided again from the perspective of each technology. These results are relative to the conventional case of using forklifts.

The first scenario tested concerns an increase in the number of pallets a warehouse handles. This scenario tests the effect of a yearly increase of 5% in the number of pallets needed to be handled. This Increase determines that the transport band generates a 13% ROI and reaches the break-even period after 2 years and 8 months. The increase in the volume of pallets impacts the operational cost of pallet handling. A higher volume of pallets generates a lower average operational cost. It is essential to mention that a 5% increase in the volumes handled does not imply an increase in purchase costs (purchase of extra equipment). The second scenario considers a 15% of labour cost. This increase generates as well higher operational costs. Therefore, the use of forklifts is highly impacted as every handling or pallet move implies an employee's involvement. This type of cost increase generates higher operational costs; therefore, automatic loading technologies provide a higher RoI and faster break-even period. The third scenario introduces an increase of risks for new technologies. This risk is quantified by considering an equivalent to 15% of the purchase value of new equipment that might be spent during the operating period. This increase results in lower RoI and a longer break-even period for ALUTs.

Yet, the ALUTs are still providing the best economic results (concerning the RoI and break-even) after 10 years of operation relative to the use of forklifts. The last scenario simulates using 100% of trucks' loading capacity (increased from 80% as given as average in the initial validation meetings). This type of operational change positively affects the results obtained for the ALUTs. The RoI proves to be much higher in case of using the transport belt technology to load trucks at their full capacity. The average loading cost is lowered. Using 100% of the trucks' capacity determines that the costs for using this technology are break evened with the cost of using forklifts after 5 months. The increase in the use of the entire truck's capacity does not show any significant changes in the economic indicators for the loading plate. If the trucks are loaded at 100% of their capacity, it is observed that Skate + technology can be considered as an alternative approach that generates lower costs than the use of forklifts. In this case, the RoI of using Skate + system is 16%, and the costs of using forklifts are equalled after 2 years and 4 months.

The following section provides the main conclusions of this research and recommendation for the purchase of automated loading technologies from an economics point of view.",innovative freight processing technologies

Transport and communications - History of technology,https://www.britannica.com/technology/history-of-technology/Transport-and-communications,N/A,"Transport and communications Many of these changes were facilitated by improvements in transport and communications. Transport developments have for the most part continued those well established in the early 20th century. The automobile proceeded in its phenomenal growth in popularity, causing radical changes in many of the patterns of life, although the basic design of the motorcar has remained unchanged. The airplane, benefiting from jet propulsion and a number of lesser technical advances, made spectacular gains at the expense of both the ocean liner and the railroad. However, the growing popularity of air transport brought problems of crowded airspace, noise, and airfield siting. World War II helped bring about a shift to air transport: direct passenger flights across the Atlantic were initiated immediately after the war. The first generation of transatlantic airliners were the aircraft developed by war experience from the Douglas DC-3 and the pioneering types of the 1930s incorporating all-metal construction with stressed skin, wing flaps and slots, retractable landing gear, and other advances. The coming of the big jet-powered civil airliner in the 1950s kept pace with the rising demand for air services but accentuated the social problems of air transport. The solution to these problems may lie partly in the development of vertical takeoff and landing techniques, a concept successfully pioneered by a British military aircraft, the Hawker Siddeley Harrier. Longer-term solutions may be provided by the development of air-cushion vehicles derived from the Hovercraft, in use in the English Channel and elsewhere, and one of the outstanding technological innovations of the period since 1945. The central feature of this machine is a down-blast of air, which creates an air cushion on which the craft rides without direct contact with the sea or ground below it. The remarkable versatility of the air-cushion machine is beyond doubt, but it has proved difficult to find very many transportation needs that it can fulfill better than any craft already available. Despite these difficulties, it seems likely that this type of vehicle will have an important future. It should be remembered, however, that all the machines mentioned so far, automobiles, airplanes, and Hovercraft, use oil fuels, and it is possible that the exhaustion of these will turn attention increasingly to alternative sources of power and particularly to electric traction (electric railroads and autos), in which field there have been promising developments such as the linear-induction motor. Supersonic flight, for nearly 30 years an exclusive capability of military and research aircraft, became a commercial reality in 1975 with the Soviet Tu-144 cargo plane; the Concorde supersonic transport (SST), built jointly by the British and French governments, entered regular passenger service early in 1976. In communications also, the dominant lines of development continue to be those that were established before or during World War II. In particular, the rapid growth of television services, with their immense influence as media of mass communication, was built on foundations laid in the 1920s and 1930s, while the universal adoption of radar on ships and airplanes followed the invention of a device to give early warning of aerial attack. But in certain features the development of communications in the space age has produced important innovations. First, the transistor, so significant for computers and control engineering, made a large contribution to communications technology. Second, the establishment of space satellites, considered to be a remote theoretical possibility in the 1940s, became part of the accepted technological scene in the 1960s, and these have played a dramatic part in telephone and television communication as well as in relaying meteorological pictures and data. Third, the development of magnetic tape as a means of recording sound and, more recently, vision provided a highly flexible and useful mode of communication. Fourth, new printing techniques were developed. In phototypesetting, a photographic image is substituted for the conventional metal type. In xerography, a dry copying process, an ink powder is attracted to the image to be copied by static electricity and then fused by heating. Fifth, new optical devices such as zoom lenses increased the power of cameras and prompted corresponding improvements in the quality of film available to the cinema and television. Sixth, new physical techniques such as those that produced the laser (light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) made available an immensely powerful means of communication over long distances, although these are still in their experimental stages. The laser also acquired significance as an important addition to surgical techniques and as an instrument of space weaponry. The seventh and final communications innovation is the use of electromagnetic waves other than light to explore the structure of the universe by means of the radio telescope and its derivative, the X-ray telescope. This technique was pioneered after World War II and has since become a vital instrument of satellite control and space research. Radio telescopes have also been directed toward the Sun’s closest neighbours in space in the hope of detecting electromagnetic signals from other intelligent species in the universe.

Military technology Military technology in the space age has been concerned with the radical restructuring of strategy caused by the invention of nuclear weapons and the means of delivering them by intercontinental ballistic missiles. Apart from these major features and the elaborate electronic systems intended to give an early warning of missile attack, military reorganization has emphasized high maneuverability through helicopter transport and a variety of armed vehicles. Such forces were deployed in wars in Korea and Vietnam, the latter of which also saw the widespread use of napalm bombs and chemical defoliants to remove the cover provided by dense forests. World War II marked the end of the primacy of the heavily armoured battleship. Although the United States recommissioned several battleships in the 1980s, the aircraft carrier became the principal capital ship in the navies of the world. Emphasis now is placed on electronic detection and the support of nuclear-powered submarines equipped with missiles carrying nuclear warheads. The only major use of nuclear power since 1945, other than generating large-scale electric energy, has been the propulsion of ships, particularly missile-carrying submarines capable of cruising underwater for extended periods.",innovative freight processing technologies
ODOT | State Transportation Innovation Councils,https://oklahoma.gov/stic.html,N/A,"Every Day Counts or EDC, is a State-based model that identifies and deploys proven, yet underutilized innovations – saving time, money, and resources that can be used to deliver more projects.



In 2010, officials from Oklahoma attended the very first EDC Summit in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The innovations that were introduced at this first Summit and some that Oklahoma adopted were: Safety Edge, Geosynthetic Reinforced Soil – Integrated Bridge System (GRS-IBS), Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA), Prefabricated Bridge Elements and Systems (PBES), and Use of In-Lieu Fee Mitigation Banking.

The first innovation that Oklahoma implemented in the field was the Safety Edge technology in 2011. Safety Edge is created by placing an attachment on to an asphalt paver and it bevels the edge of the asphalt at the shoulder. The sloped edge makes it easier for a vehicle to recover from a roadway departure.

Shortly after the first EDC Summit, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) began establishing the State Transportation Innovation Council Network or STIC, and Oklahoma soon followed by convening it’s first STIC meeting. The STIC is responsible for implementing and tracking the innovations that are introduced at the Summits.

The EDC and STIC models have been around for a decade now and we are currently in the 6th round of EDC or EDC-6. A new set of innovations are introduced every two years. Regional Summits are held every two years and the new innovations are then presented by experts from all over the country to the state’s representatives. At the end of each Summit, each state’s panel then meets to decide what innovations they would like to adopt and each state assigns the personnel to champion each innovation with a goal toward its implementation.

The FHWA is currently seeking the submission of ideas for the next round of Every Day Counts. The Regional Summits or EDC-7 will be held in the Fall of 2022, and the process will continue.

Oklahoma has adopted over 40 of these innovations since the beginning of EDC. Some of the innovations can be physically seen in the field in construction projects, but some involve processes and procedures. This program has been very beneficial to Oklahoma. Some of the innovations have saved lives and some have saved time and money. These ideas have helped us to be more efficient and we look forward to the next round of ideas that will help improve our transportation system.",innovative freight processing technologies

Innovative vaccine manufacturing enables the delivery of ...,https://cellculturedish.com/innovative-vaccine-manufacturing-enables-the-delivery-of-vaccines-to-the-developing-world/,N/A,"Innovative vaccine manufacturing enables the delivery of vaccines to the developing world

Hosted by: Brandy Sargent Guest: Dr. Alex Chatel Job Title: Product Manager, Viral Applications

Show Notes:

I began the interview by asking Dr. Chatel what he sees as the biggest challenges facing vaccine manufacturing today. He stated that the main challenge is manufacturing capacity and as a result, vaccine supply is too low compared to what is needed. Another big problem is that vaccines are being manufactured today using technologies that are outdated. These inefficient vaccine manufacturing methods cause both captial expenditure and operating expenses to be higher than necessary. Unfortunately the cost of production of vaccines will remain too high unless a change in manufacturing is implemented.

Next, I asked him why it is difficult to manufacture and distribute vaccines to the developing world? He explained that the capacity and outdated technology problems are issues in both the developed and developing world. However, the developing world has the additional challenge of distribution, specifically cold chain. Maintaining product stability is obviously important to maintaining efficacy, but cold chain distribution is often hard to maintain from manufacture to delivery in some of these areas. Some companies are working on developing more stable formulations for travel and other solutions. Administration of the vaccine and managing the proper handling and disposal of syringes is also difficult and presents the risk of spreading infectious disease.

We then discussed how Univercells’ Scale-X technology helps enable vaccines delivery worldwide? He explained that most viral vaccines are manufactured using adherent cells and thus they need a point of anchorage for production. Currently support matrices used in vaccine manufacturing include microcarriers in bioreactors or static systems such as roller bottles or stacked plate equipment. Scale-X couples the advantage of having the environmental culture control found in bioreactors with the gentle growth environment of static systems. In this system, the cells adhere to the support matrix, while nutrients in the culture media are circulated around the cells gently. On of the key advantages of this approach is that a high level of production can be achieved in a small footprint of equipment. This enables better facility design and utilization, plus capital expenditures are much less than traditional manufacturing technologies where more facility space and environmental controls are necessary.

Another advantage that Alex shared is that the equipment is small and fully automated with only a small number of operations required to run the system. This provides a much less risky and less costly alternative to traditional manufacturing where more manual operations increase risk of error and require more labor to operate. In addition, the Scale-X technology is highly scalable and permits easy and quick scale up to larger volumes. Cells receive a consistent experience at both small and large scales, so scale up is quite simple.

Alex then explained how Univercells has demonstrate success of the platform through hundreds of experiments using vero cells to produce polio vaccine. Through a grant given by the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, they have looked at improving the manufacturing of the polio vaccine from R&D to pilot scale and are now ready to scale up to large scale production. They plan to manufacture their first lot of clinical material and have also been gathering experience with other cell types and viruses for vaccine manufacturing and the manufacturing of viral vectors for cell and gene therapy applications.

I then asked if Alex could tell me a little more about their work with the Gates Foundation. He said that one of the goals of the Gates Foundation is a focus on eradication of polio from the planet and they fund programs to achieve this goal. One area of their funding is aimed at disruptive manufacturing technologies, which Scale-X represents. The goal here being to bring new technologies to vaccine manufacturing that will drive down the cost of vaccine manufacturing and furthermore make it more commercially interesting for companies to develop and produce new vaccines. Also, there is a need to fill the current supply gap for existing vaccines of interest in order to reach worldwide vaccination targets. Univercells received their grant in 2016 and will have the first lot of clinical material with the ultimate goal of manufacturing polio vaccine at large scale.

I went on to ask Alex how he envisions Scale-X being employed in the developing world. He said one of the key features of the technology is its ability to integrate with another product to create a micro facility. In this micro facility both cell culture production of viral material and also purification could occur within a small environment. This would cause a drastic reduction in required manufacturing footprint and the entire system could be quickly installed in countries where there might not be the existing manufacturing structure that exists in the developed world. The main barrier to entry for developing world that wants to manufacture its own vaccines is the cost of building a manufacturing facility. With the micro facility, these countries could consider manufacturing their own vaccines rather than purchasing from pharmaceutical companies.

Last, I asked Alex if he had anything to add for listeners. He said that one of the cool things about this technology is that it represents a step change in how vaccines are manufactured now and in the future. Once implemented it would be completely different to what we are used to and presents the opportunity to bring more modern technologies to vaccine manufacturing -an industrial revolution of vaccine manufacturing. Ultimately though the main benefit is that disease eradication targets through vaccination can be more easily met.

In the time since our podcast was recorded, Univercells announced that they have received a $14.3 Million grant to deliver affordable measles and rubella vaccines using its NevoLine™ manufacturing platform. The grant was awarded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to increase the availability of measles and rubella (M&R) vaccines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).",innovative freight processing technologies

Digital Technologies for Manufacturing Innovation

The future prosperity of the UK will increasingly depend on maintaining a resilient and sustainable manufacturing sector based on sophisticated technologies, skills base and manufacturing infrastructure with the ability to produce a high variety of complex products faster, better and cheaper. In high labour cost economies, manufacturing productivity and competitiveness will depend on maximising the utilisation of all available resources, empowering human intelligence and creativity and capturing and capitalising on available information and knowledge from design, manufacture, use and disposal of products. It will also require facilities that can quickly respond to customer requirements and minimise energy, materials and resource usage whilst maximising productivity, sustainability and economic competitiveness. The recent national seminar on “Digital Technologies for Innovative Manufacturing: Beyond Industry 4.0”, hosted by the University of Nottingham, was attended by more then 150 delegates including over 80 key industrial decision makers and identified the urgent need for a national strategy for developing technologies for future intelligent manufacturing factories. DMTI 2015 For futher information please contact Dr Helena Arrand

Targeted Economic Impact

The Digital Technologies for Manufacturing Innovation (DTMI) initiative will aim to create the strategy and delivery infrastructure for the development and accelerated implementation of digital technologies in manufacturing for dramatic increase of the global competiveness of UK manufacturing by enabling the implementation of advanced digital technologies in design, manufacture and service support. For instance, the US DMDII has identified the potential benefit of implementing intelligently connected machines and systems in commercial aviation alone as $30B over 15 years with DoD and other economic sectors citing similar business cases and opportunity for strong returns on investment. To substantiate the UK case for Intelligent Manufacturing Technologies there is a need for early studies to quantify the expected economic impact and increase in competitiveness.

Thought Provoking – extract from ‘Digitizing the Value Chain’, McKinsey Quarterly

Digital Manufacturing and design are drawing attention from innovators and investors alike. Sometimes referred to as ‘Industry 4.0’ (especially in Europe) or as the ‘Industrial Internet’ (General Electric’s term), these labels reflect a basket of new digitally-enabled technologies that include advances in production equipment (including 3-D printing, robotics and adaptive CNC mills), smart finished products (such as connected cars and others using the Internet of Things), and data tools and analytics across the value chain.

These technologies are changing how things are designed, made, and serviced around the globe. In combination, they can create value by connecting individuals and machines in a new ‘digital thread’ across the value chain—making it possible to generate, securely organize, and draw insights from vast new oceans of data. They hold the potential for disruptive change, analogous to the rise of consumer e-commerce. In 2010, when some two billion people connected online, the Internet contributed approximately $1.7 trillion to global GDP. What’s in store when 50 billion smart machines—deployed across factory floors, through supply chains, and in consumers’ hands—can connect with one another?

McKinsey had an opportunity to poll executives at companies participating in the DMDII [Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute, Chicago, USA]. While 80 percent of the respondents consider digital manufacturing and design to be a critical driver of competitiveness, only 13 percent rate their organizations’ digital capability as ‘high’.",innovative freight processing technologies

An historic partnership The CEA has been conducting R&D in biomaterials, bioprocesses and bioengineering for more than a decade. The institute invented a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) nanovectorization technology called Lipidots®, protected by more than fifteen patents. Lipidots® technology offers stealth, targeted, biocompatible drug delivery. The CEA develops milliliter-scale nanodrug manufacturing processes, and then scales them up to a liter before they are transferred to GTP Nano for scale-up to several liters (for GMP-compliant processes) for the manufacturing of clinical and commercial batches.







[1] Good Manufacturing Practices [1] Good Manufacturing Practices



The nanovectorization of drugs, now used in certain precision therapies, has been the subject of pharmaceutical research and development for more than two decades. The technology has the capacity to transport drugs directly to where they are needed and gradually release the active ingredients, substantially increasing efficacy while reducing undesirable side effects. The global nanomedicine market is expected to be worth hundreds of billions of dollars by 2025, with the therapeutics segment forecasted to expand at an 8.3% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years (sources: Market Data Forecast and Mordor Intelligence).The CDMO GTP Nano was founded in May 2018 to develop and manufacture clinical and small commercial batches of injectable nanovectorized drugs from its own production facility. The company brings agile, flexible development and manufacturing solutions to the pharmaceutical industry. The GTP Nano plant, now fully operational, can provide GMP[1] batches and aseptic filling services for batches of up to 60 kg.GTP Nano’s development and manufacturing solutions are backed by an R&D partnership with the CEA on drug nanovectorization, process development, and nanocharacterization technologies. GTP Nano is also teaming up with the new NanO’up R&D facility in Toulouse, which is staffed by CEA personnel and supported by CEA nanoformulation researchers in Grenoble. NanO’up offers a collaborative environment with the latest advances in academic research to fuel new innovations in medical technology. NanO’up can take lab-scale processes up to pre-production scale on equipment financed in part by the Occitanie Region.Together, GTP Nano and the CEA have set the ambitious goal of covering the entire nanodrug value chain from lab to manufacturing plant to offer pharmaceutical companies full process development, GMP batch production, and aseptic fill and finish services.GTP Nano’s high-performance production facility, developed in part with the support of NanO’up, will form a solid foundation for increased collaboration between GTP Nano and the CEA on high-potential new applications in oncology and vaccine therapy.",innovative freight processing technologies

Lapta

Lapta is a Russian ball game played with a bat, similar to modern baseball. The game is played outside on a field the size of 20 x 25 sazhens (about 140 x 175 feet). Points are earned by hitting the ball, served by a player of the opposite team, and sending it as far as possible, then running across the field to the kon line, and if possible running back to the gorod line. The running player should try to avoid being hit with the ball, which is thrown by opposing team members. The most ancient balls and bats for lapta were found in 14th-century layers during excavations in Novgorod.[19]

Zvonnitsa

The alphabet derived from Cyrillic and Greek, and Komi tribal signs, the latter being similar in the appearance to runes or siglas poveiras, because they were created by incisions, rather than by usual writing. The alphabet was in use until the 17th century, when it was superseded by the Cyrillic script. Abur was also used as cryptographic writing for the Russian language.

1376 Sarafan

The sarafan is a long, shapeless pinafore-type jumper dress, a part of the traditional Russian folk costume worn by women and girls. Sarafans could be of single piece construction with thin shoulder straps over which a corset is sometimes worn, giving the shape of the body of a smaller triangle over a larger one. It comes in different styles such as the simpler black, flower- or check-patterned versions formerly used for everyday wear, or elaborate brocade versions formerly reserved for special occasions. Chronicles first mention it in the year 1376, and since that time it was worn well until the 20th century. It is now worn as a folk costume for performing Russian folk songs and folk dancing. Plain sarafans are still designed and worn today as a summer-time light dress.[22][23]

15th century [ edit ]

Streltsy with muskets and bardiches.

Bardiche

The bardiche was a long poleaxe, that is a type of weapon combining the features of an axe and a polearm, known primarily in Eastern Europe where it was used instead of halberds. Occasionally such weapons were made in Antiquity and Early Middle Ages, but the regular and widespread usage of bardiches started in early-15th-century Russia. It was probably developed from the Scandinavian broad axe, but in Scandinavia it appeared only in the late 15th century. In the 16th century the bardiche became a weapon associated with the streltsy, Russian guardsmen armed with firearms, who used bardiches to rest handguns upon when firing.[24]

Boyar hat

The boyar hat, also known as gorlatnaya hat, was a fur hat worn by Russian nobility between the 15th and 17th centuries, most notably by boyars, for whom it was a sign of their social status. The higher hat indicated higher status. In average, it was one ell in height, having the form of a cylinder with more broad upper part, velvet or brocade on top and a main body made of fox, marten or sable fur. Today the hat is sometimes used in the Russian fashion.[25]

Gulyay-gorod

The gulyay-gorod (literally ""wandering town"") was a mobile fortification made from large wall-sized prefabricated shields set on wagons or sleds, a development of the wagon fort concept. The usage of installable shields instead of permanently armoured wagons was cheaper and allowed more possible configurations to be assembled. Such mobile structures were used mostly in the open steppe, where few natural shelters could be found. The wide-scale usage of gulyay-gorod started during the Russo-Kazan Wars, and later it was often used by the Ukrainian Cossacks.[26]

Ukha

Ukha is a Russian soup, made with broth and fish like salmon or cod, root vegetables, parsley root, leek, potato, bay leaf, lime, dill, green parsley and spiced with black pepper, cinnamon and cloves. Fish like perch, tenches, sheatfish and burbot were used to add flavour to the soup. Ukha as a name in the Russian cuisine for fish broth was established only in the late 17th to early 18th centuries. In earlier times this name was first given to thick meat broths, and then later chicken. Beginning from the 15th century, fish was used more and more often to prepare ukha, thus creating a dish that had a distinctive taste among soups.[27]

Russian oven

Typical Russian oven in a peasant izba.

The Russian oven or Russian stove is a unique type of oven/furnace that first appeared in the early 15th century. The Russian oven is usually placed in the centre of the izba, a traditional Russian dwelling, and plays an immense role in the traditional Russian culture and way of life. It is used both for cooking and domestic heating and is designed to retain heat for long periods of time. This is achieved by channeling the smoke and hot air produced by combustion through a complex labyrinth of passages, warming the bricks from which the oven is constructed. In winter people may sleep on top of the oven to keep warm. As well as warming and cooking, the Russian oven can be used for washing. A grown man can easily fit inside, and during the Great Patriotic War some people escaped the Nazis by hiding in ovens. Porridge or pancakes prepared in such an oven may differ in taste from the same meal prepared on a modern stove or range. The process of cooking in a traditional Russian oven can be called ""languor"" - holding dishes for a long period of time at a steady temperature. Foods that are believed to acquire a distinctive character from being prepared in a Russian oven include baked milk, pearl barley, mushrooms cooked in sour cream, or even a simple potato.[28][29]

Rassolnik

Rassolnik is a Russian soup made from pickled cucumbers, pearl barley and pork or beef kidneys, though a vegetarian version also exists. The dish is known from the 15th century, when it was initially called kalya. The key part of rassolnik is rassol, a liquid based on the juice of pickled cucumbers with some additions, famous for its usage in hangover treatment.[30]

The kokoshniks of the Holy Trinity Church in Nikitinki, Moscow.

Kokoshnik (architecture)

The kokoshnik is a semicircular or keel-like exterior decorative element in the traditional Russian architecture, a type of corbel blind arch. The name was inspired by the traditional Russian women's head-dress. Kokoshniks were used in Russian church architecture in the 16th century, while in the 17th century their popularity reached the highest point. Kokoshniks were placed on walls, at the basement of tented roofs or tholobates, or over the window frames, or in rows above the vaults.[32]

The Church of Ascension in Kolomenskoye, Moscow, an early tented roof church. Kokoshniks are seen at the base of the tent.

1510s Tented roof masonry

The tented roof masonry was a technique widely used in the Russian architecture in the 16th and 17th centuries. Before that time tented roofs (conical, or actually polygonal roofs) were made of wood and used in the wooden churches. These hipped roofs are thought to have originated in the Russian North, as they prevented snow from piling up on wooden buildings during long winters. Wooden tents also were used to cover towers in kremlins, or even applied in some common buildings, like it was in Western Europe, but the thin, pointed, nearly conical roofs of the similar shape made of brick or stone became a unique form in Russian church architecture. Some scholars, however, argue that hipped roofs have something in common with European Gothic spires, and even tend to call this style 'Russian Gothic'. The Ascension church of Kolomenskoye, built in 1532 to commemorate the birth of the first Russian Tsar Ivan IV, is often considered the first tented roof church, but recent studies show that the earliest use of the stone tented roof was in the Trinity Church in Alexandrov, built in the 1510s.[33]

Russian abacus

The Russian abacus or schoty (literally ""counts"") is a decimal type of abacus that has a single slanted deck in a unique vertical layout, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire which has four beads, for quarter-ruble fractions, that is usually near the user). It was developed in Russia from the late 16th century, at the time when abacus already was falling out of use in the Western Europe. However, the decimality of the Russian abacus (explained by Russian ruble's being the world's first decimal currency) and its simplicity (compared to the previous European and Asian versions) led to the wide use of this device in Russia well until the advent of electronic calculators in the late 20th century, though it remains in quite common use today.[34]

1586 Tsar Cannon

The Tsar Cannon is an enormous cannon, commissioned in 1586 by Russian Tsar Feodor and cast by Andrey Chokhov. It is the largest bombard by caliber. The cannon weighs 39.312 metric tonnes and has a length of 5.34 m (17.5 ft). Its bronze-cast barrel has a calibre of 890 mm (35.0 in), and an external diameter of 1,200 mm (47.2 in). Along with a new carriage, the 2 ton cannonballs surrounding the cannon were added in 1835 and are larger than the diameter of its barrel; in fact, it was originally designed to fire 800 kg stone grapeshot. The cannon is decorated with reliefs, including one depicting Tsar Feodor on a horse, hence the name of the cannon, though now the word Tsar is associated more with the supreme size of the weapon. Several copies of the cannon were made in the 21st century and installed in Donetsk, Ukraine and several Russian cities, while the original Tsar Cannon is in the Moscow Kremlin.[39][40]

17th century [ edit ]

Bochka roof

The bochka roof or simply bochka (Russian: бочка , barrel) is the type of roof in the traditional Russian architecture that has a form of half-cylinder with an elevated and sharpened upper part, resembling the sharpened kokoshnik. Typically made of wood, the bochka roof was extensively used both in the church and civilian architecture in the 17th and 18th centuries. Later it was sometimes used in Russian Revival style buildings.[41]

Gorodki arranged in the pushka (cannon) pattern behind the gorod line.

Gorodki

Gorodki or townlets is an old Russian folk sport whose popularity has spread also to Scandinavia and the Baltic States. Similar to bowling, the aim of the game is to knock out groups of skittles arranged in some pattern by throwing a bat at them. The skittles, or pins, are called gorodki (literally little cities or townlets), and the square zone in which they are arranged is called the gorod (city). The game is mentioned in the old Russian chronicles and was known in the form close to the modern one at least from the 17th century, since one of the famous players in gorodki was the young Peter I of Russia.[42]

Roller coaster

Russian Mountains, as they were called by the Westerners, were winter sled rides held on specially constructed hills of ice, sometimes up to 200 feet tall, being the first type of roller coaster. Known from the 17th century, the slides were built to a height of between 70 and 80 feet, consisted of a 50 degree drop, and were reinforced by wooden supports. In the 18th century they were especially popular in St. Petersburg and surrounding areas, from where by the late 18th century their usage and popularity spread to Europe. Sometimes wheeled carts were used instead of tracks, like in the Katalnaya Gorka built in Catherine II's residences in Tsarskoe Selo and Oranienbaum. The first such wheeled ride was brought to Paris in 1804 under the name Les Montagnes Russes (French for ""Russian Mountains""), and the term Russian Mountains continues to be a synonym for roller coaster in many countries today.[43]

Bird of Happiness

The Bird of Happiness is the traditional North Russian wooden toy, carved in the shape of a bird. It was invented by Pomors, the inhabitants of the White and Barents Sea coastline. The Bird of Happiness is made without glue or other fasteners, by elaborate carving of thin petals for the bird's wings and tail and then using a special method of spreading and curving them. Similar methods are also used in other products of the North Russian handicraft. The amulet is usually made of pine, fir, spruce, or Siberian cedar. It is suspended inside a house, guarding the family hearth and well-being.[44]

Dymkovo toy

Dymkovo toys, also known as the Vyatka toys or Kirov toys are moulded painted clay figures of people and animals (sometimes in the form of a pennywhistle). It is an old Russian folk handicraft which still exists in a village of Dymkovo near Kirov (former Vyatka). Traditionally, the Dymkovo toys are made by women. Up until the 20th century, this toy production had been timed to the spring fair called свистунья (svistunya), or whistler. The first recorded mention of this event took place in 1811, however it is believed to have existed for some 400 years, thus dating the history of Dymkovo toy at least from the 17th century.[45][46]

Troika pulling a sleigh.

Troika

The troika (тройка, ""triplet"" or ""trio"") is a traditional Russian harness driving combination, using three horses abreast, usually pulling a sleigh. It differs from most other three-horse combinations in that the horses are harnessed abreast. In addition to that, the troika is the world's only multiple harness with different horse gaits – the middle horse trots and the side horses canter. At full speed a troika could reach 45–50 kilometres per hour (28–31 mph), which was a very high speed on land for vehicles in the 17th-19th centuries, making the troika closely associated with the fast ride. The troika was developed from the late 17th century, first being used for speedy delivering of mail, and having become common by the late 18th century. It was often used for travelling in stages where teams of tired horses could be exchanged for fresh animals to transport loads and people over long distances.[47][48]

1659 Khokhloma

Khokhloma tableware on a Soviet postage stamp.

Khokhloma is the name of a Russian wood painting handicraft, known for its vivid flower patterns, red and gold colors over the black background, and the distinctive effect on the cheap and light wooden tableware or furniture, making it look heavier, metal-like and glamorous. It first appeared in the second half of the 17th century, at least from 1659, in today's Nizhny Novgorod Oblast and was named after the large trade settlement Khokhloma. The handicraft owes its origin to the Old Believers, who, fleeing from persecutions of officials, took refuge in local woods and taught some of the icon painting techniques to the local craftsmen, such as the usage of a goldish color without applying real gold. Nowadays khokhloma is one of the symbols of Russia, and apart from its usage in making tableware, furniture and souvenirs, it can be found in the wider context, for example in paintings on Russian airliners.[49]

Nikolay Diletsky's circle of fifths in Idea grammatiki musikiyskoy (Moscow, 1679)

1679 Circle of fifths

In the late 1670s a treatise called Grammatika was written by the composer and theorist Nikolai Diletskii. Diletskii's Grammatika is a treatise on composition, the first of its kind, which targeted Western-style polyphonic compositions. It taught how to write kontserty, polyphonic a cappella, which were normally based on liturgical texts and were created by putting together musical sections that have contrasting rhythm, meters, melodic material and vocal groupings. Diletskii intended his treatise to be a guide to composition but pertaining to the rules of music theory. Within the Grammatika treatise is where the first circle of fifths appeared and was used for students as a composer's tool.[50]

1685 Tula pryanik

The Tula pryanik is a type of printed gingerbread from the city of Tula, the most known kind of Russian gingerbreads. Usually the Tula pryanik looks like a rectangular tile or a flat figure. Modern Tula pryanik usually contain jam or condensed milk, while in the old times they were made with honey. The first mention of the Tula pryanik is in Tula census book of 1685.[51]

1688 Balalaika

The balalaika is a stringed instrument with a characteristic triangular body and 3 strings (or sometimes 6, in 3 courses), perhaps the best-known national Russian musical instrument. The balalaika family of instruments includes, from the highest-pitched to the lowest, the prima balalaika, sekunda balalaika, alto balalaika, bass balalaika and contrabass balalaika. The earliest mention of balalaika is found in a 1688 document, and initially it was an instrument of skomorokhs (sort of Russian free-lance musical jesters). In the 1880s the modern standard balalaika was developed by Vasily Andreev, who also started a tradition of balalaika orchestras, which finally led to the popularity of the instrument in many countries outside Russia.[52]

A Podstakannik with a glass inside

Glass-holder

The podstakannik (Russian: подстаканник, literally ""thing under the glass""), or tea glass holder, is a holder with a handle, most commonly made of metal, that holds a drinking glass. The primary purpose of podstakanniki (pl.) is to hold a very hot glass of tea, which is usually consumed right after it is brewed. It is a traditional way of serving and drinking tea in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and other post-Soviet states.

Naryshkin Baroque. Also called Moscow Baroque, or Muscovite Baroque, is the name given to a particular style of Baroque architecture and decoration which was fashionable in Moscow from the turn of the 17th into the early 18th centuries.

Early 18th century [ edit ]

Table-glass

The table-glass or granyonyi stakan (literally faceted glass) is a type of drinkware made from especially hard and thick glass, having a faceted form. Granyonyi stakan has certain advantages over the other drinkware, since due to its form and hardness it is more difficult to break. It is arguably handier in usage on moving trains or rolling ships, where it is less prone to tip and fall, or slip from hands, and less likely to break upon hitting the floor. A legend says that the first known Russian faceted glass was given as a present to Tsar Peter the Great from a glass-maker called Yefim Smolin, living in Vladimir Oblast. He boasted to Tsar that his glass couldn't be broken. Tsar Peter liked the present, however, after drinking some alcoholic beverage from it, he threw the glass on the ground and managed to break it. Still Peter didn't punish the glass-maker, and the production of such glasses continued, while the Russian tradition of breaking drinkware on certain occasions originated from that episode.[53]

1704 Decimal currency

The decimal currency is a type of currency that is based on one basic unit and a sub-unit which is a power of 10, typically 100. Most modern currencies adhere to this pattern. Russia was the first country to introduce such a currency after decimalisation of its financial system in 1704, during the reign of Peter the Great, when Russian ruble was made equal to 100 kopecks.[54]

Rebar or reinforcing bar is a common metal bar (typically made of steel), used in reinforced concrete and reinforced masonry structures. Rebar was known in construction well before the era of the modern reinforced concrete, since some 150 years before its invention rebar were used in the Leaning Tower of Nevyansk in Russia, which was built on the orders of the industrialist Akinfiy Demidov between 1725 and 1732. The purpose of such construction is one of the many mysteries of the tower. The cast iron used was of very high quality, and there is no corrosion on them up to this day.[57]

The screw drive elevator is an elevator that uses a screw drive system instead of a hoist, like it was in the earlier elevators. The invention of the screw drive was the most important step in elevator technology since ancient times, which finally led to the creation of modern passenger elevators. The first such elevator was invented by Ivan Kulibin and installed in the Winter Palace in 1793, while several years later another of Kulibin's elevators was installed in Arkhangelskoye near Moscow. In 1823, an ""ascending room"" made its debut in London.[63]

An icebreaker is a special-purpose ship or boat designed to move and navigate through ice-covered waters. The first steam-powered metal-hulled icebreaker of the modern type was the Russian Pilot, built in 1864 on orders of the merchant and shipbuilder Mikhail Britnev. It had the bow altered to achieve an ice-clearing capability (20° raise from keel line). This allowed the Pilot to push itself on the top of the ice and consequently break it. Britnev fashioned the bow of his ship after the shape of the old wooden Pomor kochs, which had been navigating icy waters of the White Sea and Barents Sea for centuries.[73]

Gymnasterka

The gymnasterka was originally introduced into the Tsarist army about 1870 for wear by regiments stationed in Turkestan during the hot summers.[74] It took the form of a loose fitting white linen ""shirt-tunic"" and included the coloured shoulder-boards of the green tunic worn during the remainder of the year. The gymnasterka was taken into use by all branches of the Imperial Army at the time of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78. Originally intended for working dress during peace-time and patterned on the traditional Russian peasant smock, the gymnasterka was subsequently adopted for ordinary duties and active service wear. It was worn as such by non-commissioned ranks in summer during the 1890s and early 1900s. The officers' equivalent was a white double breasted tunic or kitel. During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05, the white gymnasterka with its red or blue shoulder-boards proved too conspicuous against modern weaponry and the garments were often dyed various shades of khaki.[75] The smartness and comfort of the white gymnasterka enabled it to survive for a few more years of peacetime wear until a light khaki version was adopted in 1907-09 and worn during World War I.

The Winogradsky column is a simple device for culturing a large diversity of microorganisms. Invented in the 1880s by Sergei Winogradsky, the device is a column of pond mud and water mixed with a carbon source such as newspaper (containing cellulose), blackened marshmallows or egg-shells (containing calcium carbonate), and a sulfur source such as gypsum (calcium sulfate) or egg yolk. Incubating the column in sunlight for months results in an aerobic/anaerobic gradient as well as a sulfide gradient. These two gradients promote the growth of different microorganisms such as Clostridium, Desulfovibrio, Chlorobium, Chromatium, Rhodomicrobium, and Beggiatoa, as well as many other species of bacteria, cyanobacteria, and algae.

The Russian icebreaker Yermak (named after Yermak the conqueror of Siberia) was the first icebreaker able to ride over and crush pack ice. It was built in England between 1897 and 1898 after Admiral Stepan Makarov's design and under his supervision. Between 1899 and 1911 Yermak sailed in heavy ice conditions for more than 1000 days. Starting from this vessel, Russia created the largest fleet of oceangoing icebreakers in the 20th and 21st centuries.[81]

1902 Fire fighting foam

Fire fighting foam is foam used for fire suppression. Its role is to cool the fire and to coat the fuel, preventing its contact with oxygen, resulting in suppression of combustion. Fire fighting foam was invented by the Russian engineer and chemist Aleksandr Loran in 1902. He was a teacher in a school in Baku, which was the main center of the Russian oil industry at that time. Impressed by the terrible and hardly extinguishable oil fires that he had seen there, Loran tried to find such a liquid substance that could deal effectively with the problem, and so he invented his fire fighting foam.[82]

In 1933 surgeon Yuriy Vorony from Kherson in Ukraine attempted the first human kidney transplant, using a kidney removed six hours earlier from a deceased donor to be reimplanted into the thigh. He measured kidney function using a connection between the kidney and the skin. His first patient died two days later, as the graft was incompatible with the recipient's blood group and was rejected.[101] It was not until 17 June 1950, when a successful transplant was performed on Ruth Tucker, a 44-year-old woman with polycystic kidney disease, by Dr. Richard Lawler[102] at Little Company of Mary Hospital in Evergreen Park, Illinois.

Kirza is a type of artificial leather based on the multi-layer textile fabric, modified by membrane-like substances, produced mainly in the Soviet Union and Russia as a cheap and effective replacement for natural leather. The surface of kirza imitates pig leather. The material is mainly used in production of military boots and belts for machinery and automobiles. The name kirza is an acronym from Kirovskiy Zavod (Kirov plant) located in the city of Kirov, which was the first place of the mass production of kirza. The technology was invented in 1935 by Ivan Plotnikov and improved in 1941. Since that time kirza boots became a typical element of the uniform in the Soviet and Russian Army.[104]

1935 Moscow Metro

The Moscow Metro, which spans almost the entire Russian capital, is Europe's busiest metro system. Opened in 1935, it is well known for the ornate design of many of its stations, which contain numerous examples of socialist realist art.[105]

The drag chute or braking parachute is an application of the drogue parachute for decreasing the landing distance of an aircraft below that available solely from the aircraft's brakes. For the first time drag chutes were used in 1937 by the Soviet airplanes in the Arctic that provided support for the famous polar expeditions of the era. The drag chute allowed safe landings on small ice-floes.

1937 Drifting ice station

Soviet and Russian drifting ice stations are important contributors to exploration of the Arctic. An idea to use the drift ice for the exploration of nature in the high latitudes of the Arctic Ocean belongs to Fridtjof Nansen, who fulfilled it on Fram between 1893 and 1896. However, the first stations to be placed right upon the drifting ice originated in the Soviet Union in 1937, when the first such station in the world, North Pole-1, started operating. More drifting ice stations were organised after World War II, and many special equipment was developed for them, such as the elevated tents to be placed on the melting ice and indicators monitoring the ice cracks.[107]

1937 Fire-fighting sport

Fire-fighting sport is a sport discipline that includes a competition between various fire fighting teams in fire fighting-related exercises, such as climbing special stairs in a mock-up house, unfolding a water hose, and extinguishing a fire using hoses or extinguishers. It was developed in the Soviet Union in 1937, while international competitions have taken place since 1968.[109]

1938 Deep column station

The deep column station is a type of subway station, consisting of a central hall with two side halls, connected by ring-like passages between a row of columns. Depending on the type of station, the rings transmit load to the columns either by ""wedged arches"" or through purlins, forming a ""column-purlin complex."" The fundamental advantage of the column station is the significantly greater connection between the halls, compared with a pylon station. The first deep column station in the world is Mayakovskaya, designed by Alexey Dushkin and opened in 1938 in Moscow Metro.[111]

1938 Sambo

Sambo (an acronym, Самбо stands for САМооборона-Без-Оружия, meaning ""self-defence without weapons"") is modern martial art, combat sport and self-defense system developed in the Soviet Union and recognized as an official sport by the USSR All-Union Sports Committee in 1938, presented by Anatoly Kharlampiev.[112]

The AK-47 (other names include Avtomat Kalashnikova, Kalashnikov, or AK) is a selective fire, gas operated 7.62×39mm assault rifle, developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov. The AK-47 was one of the first true assault rifles. It has been manufactured in many countries and has seen service with regular armed forces as well as irregular, revolutionary and terrorist organizations worldwide. Even after six decades, due to its durability, low production cost and ease of use, the original AK-47 and its numerous variants are the most widely used and popular assault rifles in the world; more AK-type rifles have been produced than all other assault rifles combined.[115]

1947 Light beam microphone

The technique of using a light beam to remotely record sound probably originated with Léon Theremin in the Soviet Union at or before 1947, when he developed and used the Buran eavesdropping system. This worked by using a low power infrared beam (not a laser) from a distance to detect the sound vibrations in the glass windows. Lavrentiy Beria, head of the KGB, used this Buran device to spy on the U.S., British, and French embassies in Moscow

1952 Carbon nanotubes

A 2006 editorial written by Marc Monthioux and Vladimir Kuznetsov in the journal Carbon described the interesting and often misstated origin of the carbon nanotube. A large percentage of academic and popular literature attributes the discovery of hollow, nanometer-size tubes composed of graphitic carbon to Sumio Iijima of NEC in 1991. In 1952 L. V. Radushkevich and V. M. Lukyanovich published clear images of 50 nanometer diameter tubes made of carbon in the Soviet Journal of Physical Chemistry. This discovery was largely unnoticed, as the article was published in the Russian language, and Western scientists' access to Soviet press was limited during the Cold War. It is likely that carbon nanotubes were produced before this date, but the invention of the transmission electron microscope (TEM) allowed direct visualization of these structures.[119][120]

1989-1991 BARS apparatus

1991 Thermoplan

The thermoplan is a disc-shaped airship of hybrid type, currently under development in Russia. The key feature of thermoplan is its two section structure. The main section of the airship is filled with helium, while the other section is filled with air that can be heated or cooled by the engines. This design greatly improves the maneuverability, alongside the disc shape which helps resist the powerful winds up to 20 metre per second. The projet was started in the late 1980s and the early 1990s, with the first working prototype tested in 1991. That was rather small airship, and the giant thermoplan wasn't built at that time due to the problems caused by the economy crisis of the 1990s. In the late 2000s (decade), the project was revived under the name Locomoskyner by the Russian company Locomosky in Ulyanovsk.[127]

CargoSense Raises $8 Million for Supply Chain Automation,https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2024/cargosense-raises-8-million-to-enhance-supply-chain-automation/,N/A,"Supply chain automation firm CargoSense has raised $8 million in new funding.

The Series A round was led by Lanza techVentures and included participation from Merck Global Health Innovation Fund (MGHIF), according to a Wednesday (June 12) press release.

The company said the new funding will help it expand its partner network of integrated management systems, data sources, and industrial Internet of Things (IoT) platforms available to digital agents running on the CargoSense Visibility operating system.

“This will empower CargoSense’s global customers with the tools to automate and simplify additional aspects of their supply chain operations,” the company said in the release.

“The freight tech landscape continues to grow, and so have the complexities involved with incorporating new innovations into the technology stacks that supply chain teams depend on.”

Among those teams is one at pharmaceutical giant Merck, which worked with CargoSense to automate analysis of its parcel program to catch delivery problems in real time, and optimize decisions around distribution and packaging at the individual parcel level.

The results of this effort, the release said, led to the MGHIF investment in CargoSense to help automate supply chains throughout the pharmaceutical industry.

“Buyers of visibility data and related supply chain technologies for manufacturers and distributors all share an expectation: that it will reduce workloads for their supply chain teams,” said CargoSense founder and CEO Richard Kilmer.

“The reality is frequently the opposite, where there’s a large gap between new technology and their day-to-day operations, and people bridge the gap with additional manual effort and process complexity.”

PYMNTS looked at efforts to update supply chain models earlier this year, noting that they often rely on manual processes and disjointed communication, causing them to struggle to keep up with the demands of 2024’s dynamic markets.

“Recognizing this gap, businesses are increasingly turning to advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), automation and blockchain to transform and modernize every aspect of their supply chain processes,” that report said.

And in an interview with PYMNTS, GreyOrange CEO Akash Gupta shed light on how these advanced technologies, including robotics, AI and what he termed “an intelligent software orchestration layer,” have been instrumental in streamlining warehousing and fulfillment processes, while efficiently managing inventory flow and data.

He pointed to this company’s AI-driven platform, which he said models optimal decisions and outcomes to ensure seamless workflow management, and its single-view format for inventory nodes, providing visibility and control of the entire supply chain network.

“You’re getting a holistic view of what’s happening in the network,” Gupta said, “rather than looking at a bunch of Excel files … and it helps the interaction between sales managers and warehouse managers.”

How digital innovation is remaking the trucking industry,https://stripe.com/newsroom/stories/how-digital-innovation-is-remaking-the-trucking-industry,N/A,"The trucking industry used to have a productivity problem. Drivers would spend hours looking for jobs and then hit the road with their trailers half full. Along their routes they would lose time searching for in-network fuel and parking. Finally, they had to wait to get paid, creating cash-flow challenges.

But digital financial tools are creating new opportunities in a bedrock industry. Over the last two years, the number of trucking businesses using Stripe has tripled to more than 6,000. Collectively, they have processed more than $2 billion in payments.

“We’re constantly delighted by how transformative even the smallest efficiencies from new digital tools can be for any business, in any industry,” said Emily Glassberg Sands, head of information and data science at Stripe.

Optimizing routes, facilitating payouts

Instead of trawling websites or waiting in line for jobs, truckers can now get more visibility into work opportunities using platforms like Mothership.

“We built the Mothership platform so that last-mile truck drivers could more easily find work and optimize their routes to make the most money for the fewest miles,” said Gregg Luskin, cofounder and CTO of Mothership.

Mothership enables truckers to get paid faster, too. For years, carriers had to keep close tabs on paperwork like invoices or bills of lading, sometimes even slipping them underneath warehouse office doors. Mothership uses Stripe Connect to pay drivers quickly, no paperwork required. Payouts to trucking businesses via Connect have risen ten-fold over the last two years.

CloudTrucks is another startup that advances money and pays out to drivers instantly. With a CloudTrucks commercial card, issued through an integration with Stripe, drivers can access funds and cover over-the-road expenses instantly.

“We are empowering drivers with the tools they need to keep moving, make more money, offset costs, and sustain their businesses,” said Hali Mo, product manager at CloudTrucks. “Our customers used to have to wait up to 30 days to get paid after delivering a load. We’re now able to pay them instantly.”

Seamless over-the-road payments

Many transactions go into a single delivery, from unloading fees at warehouses to refueling, repairs, and paying for night parking. Relay Payments uses Connect to enable fast, contactless payments throughout the trucking ecosystem.

“Saving truckers just 20 minutes means a difference of hundreds of dollars in their paychecks and billions of dollars of efficiency for the economy,” said Ryan Droege, cofounder and CEO of Relay Payments.

With Stripe Issuing, AtoB creates similar efficiencies through smart cards that integrate with fleet management software. Trucking companies use the cards to manage payments for repairs, tolls, and fuel, all on one card powered by Issuing, allowing them to cut down on misused expenses and fraud while saving money through fuel discounts.

“Our fleet management card saves truckers money and opens up their fuelling options so they can focus on the drive ahead of them,” said Vamsi Peri, engineering manager at AtoB.

A 21st-century trucking industry

Mothership, CloudTrucks, Relay Payments, and AtoB are all helping trucking companies find success online, and growth has been rapid. Over the last two years, more than 200 trucking businesses on Stripe have doubled their payment volume. They are increasing revenue and driving down costs, just when truckers—and all the consumers who benefit from their work—need it most.

“Too many businesses across the economy are still forced to operate like they did 5–10 years ago, but trucking isn’t one of those anymore,” said Sands. “This new generation of platforms and fintechs is enabling an essential industry to innovate for the future.”",innovative freight processing technologies

Toyota Tsusho and Kwansei Gakuin University to Jointly ...,https://www.toyota-tsusho.com/english/press/detail/190927_004506.html,N/A,"(former)Machinery, Energy & Project

2019-09-27

Toyota Tsusho Corporation (""Toyota Tsusho"") and Kwansei Gakuin University announced today that they are jointly developing innovative technologies to solve on-site issues faced in the production technology of silicon carbide (SiC) wafers, a next-generation semiconductor material.

1. Silicon Carbide (SiC)

Currently, it is commonplace to use silicon (Si) wafers as substrate material for semiconductors. However, electrical loss occurs due to the properties of Si. SiC is a next-generation energy-saving material which can significantly reduce such loss. SiC has three times the bandgap*1 of Si, four times its thermal conductivity*2, and nine times its dielectric breakdown field strength*3. With such properties, SiC wafers allow for optimal electricity use and the miniaturization of cooling devices. The application of SiC wafers has begun in a wide range of fields, including the automotive industry, rail transport, home appliances, and electricity. Among these, there is high demand for the use of SiC wafers in electric vehicles such as EVs and HEVs, where there are high expectations placed on them.

2. Issues with the manufacturing of SiC wafers (refer to Figure 1)

Compared to Si, the high-performance SiC wafer has issues in terms of quality and manufacturing cost. In the first place, there are many imperfections, such as defects and strains, in SiC ingots. Furthermore, in conventional manufacturing processes, the subsurface damages produced when mechanical processing is carried out on the SiC surface, such as scratches and other defects, may impede SiC performance. In addition, conventional mechanical processing requires multiple grinding and polishing processes, with little progress in cost reduction, which hinders SiC wafers from becoming widely used.

3. Initiatives of Toyota Tsusho and Kwansei Gakuin University toward solving those issues

Kwansei Gakuin University is putting an emphasis on promoting the Green Mobility Materials and Manufacturing Technology Project (leader: Professor Tadaaki Kaneko, School of Science and Technology), which develops and is in possession of nano processing technology that autonomously controls the arrangement of surface atoms for contactless planarization of SiC wafers by means of thermal etching and growth (refer to Figure 2).



To solve the issues of SiC wafers, Toyota Tsusho and Kwansei Gakuin University are working to establish technology for the nano processing of SiC wafers at the practical application level, and to develop manufacturing processes for mass production.



Toyota Tsusho is aiming to popularize high-quality SiC wafers in various industries, such as the automotive field. In order to build a platform for introducing nano processing technology into the market, in cooperation with Kwansei Gakuin University, Toyota Tsusho will provide experts and information, in addition to carrying out intellectual property management and marketing.



*1 Bandgap: An index that shows resistance to high temperatures, with higher values showing better suitability for high-temperature operations.



*2 Thermal conductivity: An index that shows the ability to release heat, with higher values showing better ease of cooling devices.



*3 Dielectric breakdown field strength: This is the threshold value before matter breaks down when electrical voltage is applied. The larger this value, the harder it is for matter to break down, allowing products to be made smaller.

Finding the speed to innovate,https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/finding-the-speed-to-innovate,N/A,"Few executives would argue that speed and innovation are critical success factors in todayâs digital world. Being able to innovate quickly and cheaply, test digital products and services in the market, refine them, and release them on a regular basis has become a competitive advantage. But how can companies do it consistently and succeed with their digital products and services at scale?

While many companies have been trying new methods to get there, two complementary lean capabilities are showing great promise: the integration of product development with IT operations (commonly referred to as DevOps), and a focus on continuous delivery. Both emphasize automation, continuous monitoring, and sharing of information and processes across product-development and IT operations groups to enable the frequent release of small internal software updates (see sidebar, âWhat are continuous delivery and DevOps?â).

What are continuous delivery and DevOps? Continuous delivery accelerates the time to market of new software features through an investment in automation of testing, deployment, and infrastructure. This differs from the traditional approach, which often encourages the organization to defer new features and fixes into a single âbig bangâ release. Continuous delivery dramatically reduces the incremental cost for each software release; smaller releases happen early and often to provide more timely feedback from customers to the product team. DevOps is a cross-functional approach that integrates development and IT operations into a product-oriented culture. The DevOps culture embraces automation, monitoring, and sharing to enable continuous delivery. Historically, development and operations teams have worked in silos and often with opposing priorities. DevOps promotes joint ownership of a technology product by integrating these groups into a single functioning team to improve response times. DevOps is largely a by-product of the cloud revolution, which created a view of âinfrastructure as codeâ that has blurred the lines between coders and infrastructure teams.

Both capabilities can greatly increase companiesâ speed to market (cutting product-testing times from weeks to minutes) while significantly reducing the cost of delivering new products and services. They can help to ensure higher-quality software, better rates of customer adoption, and fewer risks in product and service delivery. Indeed, these capabilities can become a true engine for innovation.

Leading technology companies have been early adopters of these capabilities and have reaped the benefits. Facebook, for instance, releases millions of lines of code and implements hundreds of small changes to its website daily without downtime. And Amazon can release code every ten seconds or so, update 10,000 servers at a time, and roll back website changes with a single system command.

A number of nontech companies have also successfully explored and built up capabilities in continuous delivery and DevOps. One international travel company facing disruption from online competitors was able to introduce new features to its website more quickly and efficiently by moving software and systems to the cloud, fully automating testing and provisioning of servers, and rolling out a one-click software-deployment process. In another case, a large financial institution is using a continuous-delivery approach to streamline its product testing and go to market quickly with new digital services; processes that once took days to complete now take minutes.

But while a range of companies are experimenting with DevOps and continuous delivery, few are capturing their full value. Legacy IT systems, antiquated technologies, complex system and project-management processes, and uncoordinated actions by disconnected teams are undermining even the most determined business leaders.

In our experience, the companies that are implementing these software-development approaches most successfully have avoided investing large sums of money to move their entire technology infrastructure to the cloud in one âbig bang.â Instead they have adopted a more deliberate approach, building their capabilities step by step and funding further changes and process improvements through the resulting savings and efficiencies. In this article, we consider the three main stages for building capabilities in continuous delivery and DevOpsâsimplify, scale, and sustainâas well as the cultural changes required to reap the most value from these lean approaches.

Implementing DevOps and continuous delivery

For most companies, software development and rollout involve a period of iteration, a period in which all changes are âfrozenâ (that is, no more development is allowed), and a period during which all software changes across the organization are integrated into one package and reviewed for weeks by a large team of testers. In parallel, a separate team sets up the supporting technology infrastructure, a process that can take a few weeks. The release is deployed only after all these steps are completed. Even with this lengthy process, buggy software often results.

Given this difficult undertaking, most companies will release major internal software changes only a few times a year. But, as the company examples cited above suggest, DevOps and continuous-delivery models can help streamline the development of digital products and services and improve time to market. We have identified three main success factors for adopting these lean approaches.

Stage 1: Simplify

Companies need to create a âsingle source of truthâ for all software: one repository for storing, versioning, and tracking all source code. The mainline version of code can then be accessed quickly and reliably. For this approach to be most effective, developers must submit code changes frequently to the repository, which reduces the size of the code to be reviewed by peers as well as the complexity of merging parallel code changes.

Simultaneously, the organization should be committed to developing high-quality codeâunits that are modular, simple, and easy to maintain. Adopting âtest-driven developmentââthe process of writing automated tests for code before actually writing the code itselfâis an important step. Specifically, teams should focus initially on testing simple and discrete units of code, eventually expanding to more complex, integrated functions. To ensure that developers adhere to quality guidelines, the best companies perform complexity analyses, which measure the integration and logic factors associated with units of code and have a well-honed peer-review process to identify poorly written code so it can be corrected quickly. Googleâs engineers, for instance, send their code to a large distribution list across the company, and randomly selected peers review the code and post comments to the entire list.

Setting up this first stage does not require significant resources. We have seen companies make progress simply by reassigning one or two talented developers, implementing a handful of automation programs, and relying on vendors for monitoring and support. In many cases, companies will already have the technologies (such as source control, test control, and test automation) in-house and can supplement them with good, open-source software. One international hotel company consolidated its sales and catering systems by moving to a single version-control repository, integrating software code twice a day, and insisting that developers write automated tests for new units of change in their code. As a result, the company was able to reduce its time to market with new software by about 25 percent.

Stage 2: Scale

It can be a long and expensive task to scale up and build out fully automated IT systems that have a mix of modern and legacy technologies. Focusing on the highest-value automation opportunities is the most productive way forward. Customer-facing componentsâfor instance, mobile applications and e-commerce websitesâare usually the highest priority for most companies; they generally also experience the highest rate of change and innovation. To support these opportunities, developers should incorporate into their IT architectures sophisticated automated testing, such as verifying an end-to-end customer journey. They should also use performance tests that aim to measure the system under load or stress, and security tests that seek to measure its resilience against malicious attacks. Every âmergeâ of new code into the mainline source code should trigger these tests and the deployment of the latest code to low-risk test environments.

An important by-product of this approach is transparency into the status of the mainline code and the overall quality of the code base. The automated reports can offer managers insights that can help them continually improve planning, resource utilization, and even product and service quality (for example, by measuring conversion rates for use of specific products and services) and issue resolution (for instance, by identifying root causes of technology failures).

One large corporate bank moved to continuous delivery as part of a larger initiative to digitize its customer processesâaiming, for instance, to simplify corporate lending and customer onboarding. The company sought to automate the deployment of new software to test environments. Full-time testers worked shoulder to shoulder with developers to manually test the more complex transactions as a complement to the simpler transactions. Once a feature was completed, it was transferred to the test environment in just minutes. Any bugs identified were returned to the developers to be fixed that same day. Through its use of a continuous-delivery model, the bank was able to develop fully tested software releases within one week compared with the six weeks it had taken previously. The overall quality and predictability of those releases were vastly improved as well.

Stage 3: Sustain

While companies can often gear up to change their software-development processes in one big burst, this all-hands-on-deck approach is rarely sustainableâhence the appeal of continuous delivery (exhibit). However, the pursuit of continuous delivery needs to be easy for staffers to follow and ingrained in the culture to maintain its value. This means systematically moving technologies and products to cloud-based virtualized environments, with software automation in place to fully control the server and technology infrastructure, scale, and quality. One international consumer-goods company migrated its software to the cloud so it could give developers self-service access to production-like environments for testing, delegate the execution of thousands of automated tests to âvirtual serversâ that take seconds to run, and adjust servers automatically to support spikes in traffic based on seasonality and multimarket demands.

Migration of software to the cloud gives companies an opportunity to simplify their IT architectures and introduce new technologies (middleware, for instance) and capabilities (A/B testing, for example) without affecting legacy systems.

Companies can take advantage of cloud-based environments and use automation extensivelyâsome companies even choose not to release features if at least 80 percent of the code is not covered by automated testing. Failures can be rolled back in seconds, allowing fixes to be made without putting significant parts of the business at risk. Developer work flows are also automated to allow one-click software releases in seconds, not hours. Organizations can continuously release software to production with limited reliance on human intervention, and changes can be verified and released with a high degree of confidence.

As a companyâs continuous-delivery capabilities mature, it can shift its focus from automating development work flows to improving system scalability, resilience, and disaster recovery, as well as optimizing the monitoring and logging of systems to better track customer and system performance. Product teams can learn and make decisions quickly based on data that affect the customer experience and performance.

Itâs about more than technology

To move toward DevOps and continuous delivery, companies cannot focus solely on revamping tools and technologies. They must treat the initiative as a change program requiring an updated culture. The CIO and other business leaders must commit resources and time that go far beyond forming committees and attending more meetings. Shifting to this way of working requires a new organizational model, though which particular one depends on a companyâs specific situation. Some organizations have set up a model similar to a center of excellence, in which a separate DevOps team is created and used to embed capabilities inside teams, build and expand capabilities, set standards, and capture and disseminate best practices. Other organizations embed DevOps champions within application-development teams. Whatever the model, in our experience, a successful transformation requires the following ingredients:

Be clear about the change, and set high aspirations.

Senior leaders should create a compelling vision of where the organization needs to go, provide resources for a change program, lay out a road map, and put in place clear measures of success. A change program should articulate a new operating model for how teams work together, including who has decision rights and what process checks are needed. A road map should include the assignment of people with specific responsibilities, a plan for building capabilities, and the identification and sequencing of architecture and tool changes. Goals should be bold but specificâfor instance, reducing time to market from months to days, or rolling out releases in seconds, not hours. One logistics company set a high barâto transform its entire technology delivery process within a yearâand communicated it widely.

Create incentives that are aligned with business outcomes.

The incentives associated with the successful use of DevOps and continuous-delivery approaches need to be aligned with designated business outcomesâfor instance, revenue targets, conversion rates, customer-engagement scores, product-quality metrics, and time-to-market figuresâand should be shared by the entire team. Too often we see that the development group and business have different incentivesâthe latter is focused on revenues while the former is worried about delivery times. Similarly, there is often a disconnection between the development group and the operations team, which will necessarily be fixated on up-time and ticket management. Incentives should motivate and reward complete teams rather than individual functions.

Create a âsingle teamâ mind-set.

To deliver on the promise of DevOps and continuous delivery, coders and infrastructure teams must work in lockstep. That requires infrastructure, operations, and developer team members to work side by side using the same agile software process of iterative planning, development, and testing. During a 12-month transformation, the CIO of a technology service provider moved 500 full-time employees in operations physically closer to the engineering team to enable agile software development. The company also trained IT employees in new delivery methods. This allowed the organization not only to become more efficient but also to significantly reduce the time it took to roll out service changes to end users.

Build a continuous-improvement and data-driven culture.

Itâs not enough to release great software code once; high-performing companies do it continually. That requires teams to collect and interpret data and customer feedback, adapt code, and redeploy in near-continuous cycles. To do this quickly, teams need transparency and easy-to-understand metrics so they can understand exactly how the program is performing. One bank created such transparency by integrating critical site traffic, customer-performance metrics (such as number of visitors and digital-sales figures), and site-operations metrics into an online dashboard that was projected on 60-inch LCD screens across the room where the digital team was located. The visual metrics made it easier for teams to spot early indicators of lagging performance; errors were reduced by 25 percent over a few months.

Build the right capabilities.

As infrastructure and operations teams shift from executing manual steps to writing software code to automating processes, new skills and experience will be required. Some of the more important ones include the ability to write software code and test automation; experience with new tools, programming languages, and development-work-flow automation; experience with agile development; and collaborations with software-development groups and business. Organizations that were âborn digitalâ may be able to look in-house for people with these skills, but most companies are being forced to look outside for help.

Speed and innovation are the hallmarks of a successful company in the digital age. To get there, companies should consider adopting an agile-software-development culture that goes beyond delivering one-time results to continuously adapting and growing over time.",innovative freight processing technologies

Ship Technology Excellence Awards 2024: Martechnic,https://www.ship-technology.com/excellence-awards/featured-company/2024-martechnic/,N/A,"Martechnic, an oil quality management solutions provider headquartered in Hamburg, Germany, has won an award in the Environmental Category in the 2024 Ship Technology Excellence Awards.

The company’s innovative, patent-pending test device MT COOLANT CHECK has been recognised for offering a non-chemical and environmentally friendly approach to engine coolant quality assessment, marking a significant stride towards sustainable predictive maintenance practices in the maritime industry.

The Ship Technology Excellence Awards celebrate the greatest achievements and innovations in the industry. Powered by the business intelligence of GlobalData, the programme provides a platform to recognise the people and companies that are driving change.

A sustainable shift in coolant testing

Traditionally, on-board engine coolant testing has relied on the complex physical and/or chemical analyses of individual parameters (chlorides, nitrite additives, pH etc.) to evaluate the sufficiency of the anti-corrosion effect of the coolant in use. Different chemicals, predominantly classified as hazardous products, are utilised for the analyses. Martechnic’s own test kits COOLANT AND LUBE OIL and MT COOLING WATER CHECK have been part of this conventional approach.

Test Device MT COOLANT CHECK (Patent Pending): Non-chemical Approach to Engine Cooling System Predictive Maintenance

Instead, the test device MT COOLANT CHECK offers the environmentally friendly alternative measurement method. The engine coolant quality and its anti-corrosive protection is determined by means of the electrotechnical apparatus, with constant (corrosion-resistant) and working/changeable (corrosion-prone) electrodes in a simulated engine cooling system.

No chemicals are required at all. The device, thereby, eliminates the use of harmful substances and reduces environmental risks, especially to marine ecosystems.

Technical excellence and environmental responsibility

The MT COOLANT CHECK simplifies the testing process by analysing water-based coolants with just one single measurement through a single coolant sample in a simulated cooling system, delivering results in just 15 minutes. All the evaluation is carried out fully automatically.

Furthermore, the company has introduced the “Lagner” (lag) as a new unit of measurement. This value is central to assess the remaining corrosion protection of the engine coolant in use.

If the anti-corrosive effect of the coolant is insufficient, the device can calculate the precise dosing rate of the chemical additive required to add, if any, by entering the following available data provided in the manufacturer’s coolant specifications:

CW (cooling water) volume in m3 Dosing method: liquid or powder Dosing factor: l/m3 or kg/m3

To replace the use of disposable pH test strips, the pH value of the coolant can be also measured through the integration of a separate optional pH electrode into the sensing head of the test device MT COOLANT CHECK.

On the basis of the data received, the maintenance crew on-board a vessel receives a clear recommendation to further actions if required.

Oil Quality Management: Condition Monitoring of Fuel, Lube & Hydraulic Oil and Cooling Water

More Than 25 Years of Tradition and Innovation

Martechnic was established in 1997. Since its founding, the company has become a leading expert in oil quality management. A small family-owned business has succeeded to secure its international recognition and a solid niche market position of technical solutions for condition monitoring of fuel, lube, and hydraulic oil. In March 2022 Martechnic celebrated its 25th corporate anniversary.

A cornerstone of the business’s philosophy and practice has been the combination of two principles: tradition and innovation. Using the benefits of past knowledge and experience, Martechnic focuses on innovative technology and offers its customers oil and cooling water test analysis equipment for on-site application.

The company designs, develops and manufactures a wide range of high-quality products: oil test devices and oil test kits, intelligent oil sensor technology, cooling water testing equipment, oil sampling bottles and ultrasonic cleaning equipment. A global network of Martechnic’s partner companies provides for 24-hour customer service, quick order processing and worldwide delivery.

Company’s Vision and Mission

For over 25 years Martechnic’s oil analysis solutions have been an effective tool to support smooth running, optimal and reliable performance as well as cost-effective maintenance of on-board machinery, engine, and equipment. The adoption of oil condition monitoring practices or in-service oil testing allows engine operators to routinely measure, monitor and analyse crucial oil parameters directly on board a vessel. Thereby any off-specification issues (e.g., degradation of the oil quality or abnormal wear) or changes in the oil condition (e.g., contamination) can be detected before an actual problem occurs. Such an early-warning mechanism enables adequate preventive maintenance actions: continuous information on engine performance can help fixing relatively minor problems to avoid possible costly engine failures, major damages, and uncontrolled downtimes.

Successful implementation of oil condition monitoring programs can also help to comply with international norms and standards of environmental protection aiming at minimising environmental impact, supporting sustainable development, and saving precious resources.

1.1 What is ITS?

1.2 Background Situation and Significance of Promoting ITS

1.3 Japan ' s Tasks with Respect to Global ITS

1.4 Significance of Working Out a Comprehensive Plan for ITS



1.1 What is ITS?

The Intelligent Transport Systems(hereafter called ITS) is intended for advances in navigation systems, establishment of electronic toll collection, assistance for safe driving, optimization of traffic management and increasing efficiency in road management by building an integrated system of people, roads and vehicles utilizing advanced data communication technologies.

While providing users with quick information required for their safe and comfortable travel in ways easy to understand, ITS makes automated vehicle operations possible by making the most of information and control technology. With these operations, ITS makes it possible for users to enjoy a high level of use of roads and reduces many of the work loads commonly associated with driving, walking, and cycling. In this way, ITS will accomplish a major improvement in road transport safety, efficiency and comfort, and traffic operations and congestion, thereby significantly contributing to the realization of an improved quality of life and environmental conservation.







Figure 1.1.1 ITS Conceptual Model





1.2 Background Situation and Significance of Promoting ITS

ITS will contribute greatly to finding solutions to the problems facing today ' s road transport, such as traffic accidents and traffic congestion. At the same time, ITS is expected to play a primary role in expanding and creating new markets for auto and data communication-related industries.

Additionally, ITS is expected to play an important role in materializing an advanced information communication society designed to meet the requirements of the 2lst century.

(1) Breakthrough for Solving Road Transport Problems

Vehicular traffic on roads has greatly contributed to the development of the national economy, and is fulfilling a critical role in modern society. On the other hand, traffic accidents have increased, resulting in a death toll of over 10,000 persons per year. Additionally, traffic congestion in urban areas has caused economic losses amounting to 12 trillion yen, and time losses amounting to 5.6 billion person-hours* (according to one estimate). Major problems have surfaced with respect to transport safety and efficiency. Also, issues such as environmental deterioration along roads, disharmony with the global environment, and increased energy consumption are growing in severity and importance. Solutions to these problems are strongly needed.

With Japan ' s diverse natural and social conditions, what is often requested is the availability of a means of road transport that is highly reliable and serviceable despite weather extremes and natural disasters, plus improvement in service standards of public transport in local areas.

In the 21st century, certain social constraints will be apparent such as the aging of the population, further decline in the birth rate and still further decline in the productive population. In the area of road transport, the realization of a system to reduce the driver ' s work load is needed. Also required is coordination of traffic so that users can choose various modes of travel with comfort and improved efficiency.

Responding to such requests, the promotion of ITS will reduce traffic accidents and reduce time losses resulting from traffic congestion. Also, it will become possible for users to travel with a high degree of reliability and convenience in response to the needs of the respective regions. It will also be possible to realize energy efficiency by alleviating traffic congestion and improving traffic flow. By mitigating the effects of traffic congestion and traffic flow and adjusting the volume of traffic, efficient energy use and reduction of vehicle emissions will be accomplished, thereby contributing to the maintenance of a sound environment along the roads and the global environment. Further, reduction of driver ' s work load by ITS can provide a road transport system that will be easier for the elderly to utilize, with the arrival of an aging society. In addition, ITS can provide the distribution businesses, the artery of industry, with a better business environment for the transport of goods. In this way, promotion of ITS can be expected to finally solve the various problems caused by traffic congestion and serve as the foundation for strengthening the traffic system which plays such a vital role in Japan ' s industrial base.

*White paper on construction (1993).

(2) Creation of New Industries

In light of Japan ' s current low economic growth rate and recent business trends, it is necessary to promote new industries that can stimulate demand, create markets for their products, and revitalize the economy. For that purpose, it is essential to forecast social and economic trends of the future, encourage new research activities, support capital investments and production activities to pave the way for the 21st century, and create an industrial field where development of markets around the world is possible.

Amid this situation, ITS is often considered as playing a core role in the multimedia industry with enormous market potential. In fact, ITS already has a large market with respect to car navigation systems, with over one million units having been sold in Japan by 1995. ITS was introduced to the world of road transport, which is inherently closely connected to people ' s lives. As ITS is much looked forward to by road users, its use for practical purposes responding to the needs of users will lead to the formation of a large-scale new market in areas related to the automobile industry and data communications industry.

(3) Leader of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Society

Individuals ' free and broad range of travel by vehicle; high mobility between remote areas by high-speed railway, car or airplane; and high-quality global wire and wireless communications and telecommunications networks are necessary conditions for the realization of a rich and vigorous life. An advanced information and telecommunications society is supported by advanced information and communications technology, and is a society in which immediate and bi-directional massive loads of information communication can be performed.

The earliest possible realization of such a society is eagerly sought. Through road transport, which is closely connected with people ' s daily lives, ITS presents specific configurations of an advanced information and telecommunications society to people. For the realization of ITS, utilization of information communication technologies that speed up the pace of progress in various fields is necessary. At the same time, promotion of ITS will accelerate advancement of information-related equipment, and support the progress of an advanced information and telecommunications society in other fields.

Due to public demand, development of ITS for everyday practical purposes has already partially begun, with the intention of nationwide development and deployment.

By keeping in harmony with the development of information-oriented operations in other fields, ITS is expected to play the leading role in the pursuit and realization of an advanced information and telecommunications society.

'

s Tasks with Respect to Global ITS

(1) International Situations Surrounding ITS

With Japan, the U.S. and Europe taking the lead, development of ITS on a global scale is being carried out. The U.S. and a number of European countries in particular are aggressively and systematically promoting ITS as their central theme in implementing road transport policies, by adjusting their systems, plans, and budgets. In the Asia-Pacific region, where Japan and other nations share common tasks to accomplish, work has started on ITS.

(a) Activities in the U.S.

The U.S. made efforts to develop ERGS (Electronic Route Guidance Systems), which utilizes two-way road-vehicle communications to provide route guidance, in the period from the late 1960s to 1970. After that, such a project had not been carried out for some time. In 1988, however, an informal study team called "" Mobility 2000 "" was organized, and a new attempt was made. To expand on this theme and establish a national focus, IVHS America (Intelligent Vehicle Highway Society of America) was established in 1990. Subsequently, ISTEA (Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act) was legislated in December 1991, and ITS was positioned as a central project of road transport policy.

While efforts were being made to foster a supportive environment for implementation of ITS, the first major step was the drafting of an ITS implementation plan. In May 1992, the IVHS Strategic Plan (Strategic Plan for Intelligent Vehicle-Highway Systems in the United States) was formulated as a grand design to promote ITS over the next 20 years. In March 1995, the National ITS Program Plan was prepared by ITS America (Intelligent Transportation Society of America), the new name given to IVHS America by USDOT (United States Department of Transportation) in September 1994; comprehensive materials for planning and introduction of the final goals for developing and deploying ITS were provided.

In addition, promotion of the development of specific systems is being aggressively conducted, and at more than 80 places across the United States, field tests have been or are being conducted. On top of this, AHS (Automated Highway System), a key project conducted by NAHSC (National Automated Highway System Consortium) is being promoted with Government participation. In order to clarify the framework of services to be realized by ITS and the mutual relationships between or among various systems, a system architecture with USDOT playing a central role is under development. The final report is expected in June 1996, and compilation of all available data into one volume on the ITS promotion plan is scheduled for completion.

According to the changing structure of the system architecture, promotion of ITS in the U.S. is moving from a planning phase to an infrastructure improvement phase. In January 1996, "" Operation Time Saver "" to introduce ITI (Intelligent Transportation Infrastructure) for realization of ITS in 75 major cities as a goal for the next 10 years was announced by USDOT.

(b) Activities in Europe

In Europe, the development of ALI (Autofahrer Leit und Informations System) was promoted in the mid-1970s with Germany playing a central role. In 1986 PROMETHEUS (Programme for a European Traffic with Highest Efficiency and Unprecedented Safety) began, lead by the private sector, and in 1988 the public sector-led DRIVE (Dedicated Road Infrastructure for Vehicle Safety in Europe) program commenced. These programs have been succeeded by the current PROMOTE (Programme for Mobility in Transportation in Europe) and the Telematics Applications Programme. In addition, ERTICO (European Road Transport Telematics Implementation Coordination Organization) was set up as a public-private sector organization to provide support for refining and implementing Europe ' s Transport Telematics Project.

The issue of standardization is also being aggressively addressed in Europe. CEN (Commité Européen de Normalisation)/TC278 was established in 1990 to handle standardization activities, followed by the founding of ISO (International Organization for Standardization)/TC (Technical Committee) 204.

(c) Activities in the Asia-Pacific Region

In the Asia-Pacific region, road transport problems are becoming increasingly serious because of the high population concentration in urban areas and the sudden growth of motorization in many countries.

In trying to cope with the situation, several countries (e.g., Hong Kong, Malaysia, and Singapore) are grappling with the issue of installing electronic toll collection systems. Work on ITS has started in other countries as well.





(2) Work on ITS in Japan

(a) First Period

Japan actually started working on ITS much earlier than many other countries around the world. In 1973, work on CACS (Comprehensive Automobile Traffic Control System) was initiated by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, with the development of a route guidance system and test operations. This period can be called the first period of ITS development.

(b) Second Period

During the 1980s, work on RACS (Road/Automobile Communication System) by the Ministry of Construction, and AMTICS (Advanced Mobile Traffic Information and Communication Systems) by the National Police Agency was carried out. Through joint efforts with the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, which had worked on standardization projects, these endeavors were streamlined and combined into VICS (Vehicle Information and Communication System).

From the late 1980s through the 1990s, ARTS (Advanced Road Transportation Systems, a Ministry of Construction project), in which the overall concept on advancement of road traffic through integration of roads and vehicles was structured, was pursued. Accompanying this project were various others, including SSVS (Super Smart Vehicle System) intended for the intelligent vehicle traffic system (a Ministry of International Trade and Industry project), ASV (Advanced Safety Vehicle) intended for promotion of research and development of vehicle safety technologies (a Ministry of Transport project), and UTMS (Universal Traffic Management System) intended for comprehensive traffic management by covering even the generation of road traffic (a National Police Agency project). Work on the development of specific technologies or systems outside of the above-mentioned programs has also been conducted. Three examples are the following; (1) low power millimeter wave radar, which will play an important role in preventing car collisions (a Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications project); (2) a non-stop electronic toll collection system, which will enable users to pay tolls automatically (electronically) without stopping at toll stations (a Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications and Ministry of Construction project); and (3) research and development work on a wireless card system expected to be used, for example, in the non-stop electronic toll collection system (a Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications project).

Meanwhile, VERTIS (Vehicle, Road, and Traffic Intelligence Society) has been organized by representatives of industry and academia, and is conducting a variety of ITS-related activities, such as information exchanges with ITS America, ERTICO, other world conference secretariats, and relevant officials in Western countries. Positive efforts are being made in forming a private-sector ITS market; on the basis of the digital road map developed jointly by the public and private sectors, car navigation systems utilizing GPS, and other technologies have been made commercially available. As a result of these achievements, the number of cumulative shipments of vehicles equipped with navigation systems exceeded 1 million units in 1995. Clearly, a new promising market is being created. The period from 1980 to the beginning of 1995 can be called the second period of ITS development.

(c) Third Period

Amid the situation outlined above, the Advanced Information and Telecommunications Society Headquarters headed by the Prime Minister finalized the "" Basic Guidelines on the Promotion of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Society "" in February 1995. Five government offices and concerned agencies prepared the "" Basic Government Guidelines of Advanced Information and Communications in the Fields of Roads, Traffic and Vehicles "" in August 1995, and began to grapple with ITS development and practical use based on a unified policy. The period following this time of dealing with ITS in a consistent and harmonious manner, as seen in making VICS available for practical use, can be called the third period of ITS development.

Following the publication of the basic guideline, the five government bodies promoted research and development on infrastructure provision for advancing navigation systems and assistance for safe driving. They also promoted development and deployment in various ITS fields such as the optimization of traffic management. At the second ITS World Congress held in Yokohama in November 1995, they presented their then-current efforts on ITS to experts and operators from academia, industry and governments around the world. The congress served as a forum for international technology and information exchange.

In 1996, Japan allocated 59.6 billion yen for making ITS available for practical use and for improvement of infrastructure, and 7.4 billion yen for research and development of ITS. With such a high level of financial support, the conditions for more aggressive promotion of ITS are being prepared.

Figure 1.3.1 ITS Development Chronology in Japan, the U.S. and Europe







(3) Tasks for Promoting ITS as Observed from an International Viewpoint

Observing the situation of ITS promotion in Japan from an international viewpoint, three main tasks regarding international cooperation can be envisaged. They are summarized in the subsections that follow.

(a) Work in Cooperation with Western Countries

When Japan started individual work on ITS, it was among the early pioneers of ITS around the world. Over the years, Japan has accumulated a substantial knowledge base from research and development work on ITS. Consequently, there are several fields in which ITS developments are ahead of those in other countries, e.g., road map databases, navigation systems, and road-vehicle communications.

It is indispensable for Japan to exchange information and personnel with countries around the world to share technologies and information to further advance the development and deployment of ITS worldwide. Such international exchanges include offering Japanese advanced technologies to other nations to contribute aggressively to the world community in promoting ITS, as well as introducing advanced expertise from the U.S. and Europe.

(b) Achieve ITS Suited for the Asia-Pacific Region

It is necessary for Japan to steadily improve road infrastructure, which is short in quantity, to solve road transport problems, and to achieve advanced use of roads by promoting ITS. This situation, of course, is not unique to Japan. Many countries in the Asia-Pacific region are experiencing or have already experienced rapid motorization with comparatively slow-paced road infrastructure improvements.

The development of ITS in Japan can serve as a model for ITS planning in other countries in the Asia-Pacific region. As a member of this important region, Japan is motivated to pursue aggressive technical and personnel exchanges and provide the necessary support for realization of ITS.

(c) Provide Input to ITS-related International Standardization Activities

If internationally interoperable ITS is to be achieved, worldwide effort and support are required in the area of international standardization.

ISO/TC204* and ITU-R** (International Telecommunication Union-Radio Communication Sector) are working on standardization related to ITS under the title of TICS (Transport Information and Control Systems).

It is necessary for Japan to aggressively participate in standardization activities to ensure that its views are well understood by the world community, and to reflect development trends of ITS-related industries in the country.

* ISO: Non-governmental organization charged with setting standards in industrial fields such as mining and manufacturing.

* * ITU: Technical organization of the United Nations in the telecommunications field.

1.4 Significance of Working Out a Comprehensive Plan for ITS

ITS covers extensive areas such as roads, traffic, vehicles and information communications. Not only under the National Police Agency, Ministry of International Trade and Industry, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, and Ministry of Construction, but also through alliances and cooperation among industry, academia and government, ITS has become the first truly national project to be realized. In promoting such a national project, a strategic way of working on it within a comprehensive plan is indispensable.

In Japan, efficient research and development activities have been conducted such that much of the work that could become a nucleus of ITS was aggressively carried out and linked to practical use. From now on, by making the most of the acquired technical know-how, dealing systematically with ITS is the required work in a new phase.

The comprehensive plan for ITS will clarify the relation between people ' s everyday lives and ITS. It is expected that the public will then acquire a deeper understanding of the need for ITS. For those from industry, academia and government, the comprehensive plan will serve as a common recognition and goal concerning their roles and the significance of research and development, as a result of which they can make planned efforts systematically and efficiently. In addition, Japan can show the world how the nation is dealing with ITS, thereby helping to realize smooth international cooperation and harmonious relations.

In light of this background, this comprehensive plan for ITS was prepared by the five government bodies concerned with ITS, following "" Basic Guidelines on the Promotion of an Advanced Information and Telecommunications Society "" and "" Basic Government Guidelines of Advanced Information and Communications in the Fields of Road, Traffic and Vehicles "" . This comprehensive plan was designed to provide a long-term vision to illustrate basic concepts about targeted ITS functions, development and deployment, such that establishment of ITS in Japan would be systematically and efficiently promoted in accordance with the stated needs of users.",transportation safety tech ventures

Barriers to Transportation in Rural Areas

Rural communities face challenges in offering safe, affordable, and reliable methods of transportation. This section provides an overview of barriers to establishing or accessing transportation programs in rural communities. For more information about considerations for implementing transportation programs, see Module 4 Implementation Considerations.

Safety and Infrastructure Issues

Lower population density in rural areas often leads to lower ridership for fixed transit routes and a smaller tax base to fund maintenance and repair of transportation systems. The lack of investment in infrastructure in rural communities coupled with increasing use of rural roads over time has also affected transportation safety. The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Highway Administration estimates that 40% of roads in rural areas are “inadequate for current travel,” while nearly 50% of bridges over 20 feet long are currently considered “structurally deficient.” The Federal Highway Administration also reports that in 2012, 54% of all road fatalities occurred in rural areas.

Since many rural residents rely on personal automobiles as their main means of transportation, maintenance of rural roads is crucial for daily travel. The quality of existing roadways in rural areas is also of concern. Due to environmental constraints, many rural roads are built from gravel or dirt, which are potential safety hazards. Additionally, the terrain of many rural areas at the state and even local level can vary significantly, with many rural areas having rougher terrain than urban areas. This geographic diversity indicates that no single type of transportation can fit the needs of every rural community.

The frequency of travel on some of these rural roads has increased over the past years as tourism becomes a growing business in the rural U.S. Most of the country's national parks are located in rural regions, which draws huge populations each year. In addition, much of the nation's food industry relies on transportation of products long distances on rural roads and highways. The safety and structural integrity of these roads is important to maintain an interconnected transportation system.

Coordination of Programs and Services

With several federal agencies and various local organizations involved in coordinating transportation systems and programs throughout the U.S., coordination of services is important. Rural communities often face challenges related to fragmentation and duplication of services among different programs — such as Medicaid or Veteran's Affairs services — that serve clients in the same geographic area. This lack of coordination among local and state agencies can lead to inefficient use of limited resources. Communication between workforce programs continues to be a problem in many rural regions. The National Network for the Transportation Workforce aims to close this gap in communication by serving as a regional coordinating body for transportation workforce programs throughout the country in an effort to alleviate this issue.

Distance

Long distances are a key barrier for many people living in rural areas. Average trips for medical or dental services are about 9 miles longer in rural regions. Those with a personal vehicle can be adversely affected by rising gas prices, making longer trips more expensive. For those without a personal vehicle, traveling long distances can be especially burdensome. People who do not have access to a motor vehicle often have to rely on public transportation services, and destinations are not always located on a public transportation route.

Population Density

Low population density over a large expanse of land defines many rural areas. From 2010 to 2013, the number of non-metro counties that are decreasing in population reached a historic high of 61%, indicating that low population density will remain an issue in many regions. Regions with low population density face challenges with constructing and maintaining transportation systems due to a smaller pool of local tax payers to finance transit projects.

Examining information infrastructure,https://cmr-journal.org/article/view/22263,Автор: SE Sengupta,"Abstract

Freight movements and deliveries into dense urban US regions challenge businesses and governments working within constrained resources to meet customer and societal needs. We examine the relationship between public and private investments in intelligent transportation systems (ITS) as complementary drivers to improve supply chain performance (SCP) and community livability and safety (CL&S). A research framework drawn on precepts from complementarity theory combined with business intelligence and shared value is developed. We propose five key propositions and provide a taxonomy of ITS benefits mapped to SCP and CL&S based on our literature review and industry interviews. Our conceptual study results suggest that increased information sharing provided by ITS infrastructure can contribute to the public and private realms by creating synergy. The study informs managers from a practical perspective regarding the shared value model synergies evident from ITS investment decisions.

Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-Concord) has announced the advancement of numerous projects seeking to support public safety, education, transportation, accessibility and sustainability throughout his district, including the San Ramon Valley.

The 15 projects advanced for consideration by the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations as part of the appropriations process for the 2025 fiscal year total $35 million in spending on projects throughout the district, several of which would have countywide and local impacts.

“I am proud to advance over $35 million in funding for CA-10 that would make our communities safer and more accessible, support students, and reduce our environmental impact,” DeSaulnier said in an announcement in May. “I appreciate the advocacy and partnership of our cities and local organizations in submitting these projects, and I will do all I can to see them through this process and the funding delivered to our district.”

If approved in full, a portion of that funding – $3 million – would go toward safety and accessibility improvements on Village Parkway in Dublin, including lane narrowing and sidewalk widening plus protected intersections and bike lanes which was sought by a community project funding request for the Village Parkway Reconstruction and Complete Streets Project according to former Dublin mayor Melissa Hernandez in DeSaulnier’s announcement.

“The Project will address critical infrastructure needs by improving street surfacing and bicycle accessibility; enhancing safe transit and bus stops; and upgrading sidewalks for pedestrian use near Dublin High School,” Hernandez said. “When finished, the improved Village Parkway will be a much safer thoroughfare for all Dublin residents.”

The Dublin project is the only one in the current package specific to a Tri-Valley municipality, with other local projects proposed for Oakley, Walnut Creek, and Concord. A majority of the projects, however, would have a countywide impact including in public safety, public works, and public transportation.

DeSaulnier is seeking funding for two projects for the Contra Costa District Attorney’s office totaling $1.1 million, $600,000 of which would be for the creation of an Organized Retail Theft Prevention and Prosecution Unit in the office, and $500,000 of which would go toward efforts to identify and combat labor exploitation and trafficking as well as supporting trafficking survivors.

“Representative DeSaulnier and I are on the same page about combatting organized retail theft and labor trafficking,” District Attorney Diana Becton said in DeSaulnier’s announcement.

“Our ability to protect Contra Costa residents hinges on dismantling these criminal networks and holding perpetrators accountable,” she continued “Achieving this means making smart investments in public safety so we in law enforcement can continue to effectively work in seeking justice for the victims of crime.”

Another public safety oriented project in the package is a proposed $1,915,000 in funding for the Contra Costa Fire Protection District for equipment installation and replacement such as backup generators and other upgrades aimed at ensuring reliability for the district’s communications system during power outages.

“This project will have a direct impact on improving the public safety radio infrastructure for our firefighters, ambulance crews, and all first responders throughout Contra Costa County and northern Alameda County,” Fire Chief Lewis Broschard said in DeSaulnier’s announcement. “Congressman DeSaulnier is helping us to keep our communities and our first responders safe with this critical infrastructure investment.”

On the public works front, one of the pricier projects proposed is a $4 million upgrade to ultraviolet technology aimed at decreasing energy usage and maintaining public health for the Central Contra Costa Sanitary District.

“This important project will provide direct community benefits by improving the resiliency of Central San’s wastewater operation during extreme weather events and significantly reduce its energy footprint,” Central San General Manager Roer Bailey said in DeSaulnier’s announcement.

“Specifically, federal funding would support the transition to a state-of-the-art UV system that will make the water treatment plan more sustainable and energy efficient because it will lower disinfection demand, decrease energy use, and meaningfully reduce greenhouse gasses produced annually,” he continued.

Another $4 million project aimed at promoting environmental sustainability in the package includes funding the purchase and installation of hydrogen fuel cell generators for County Connection as the agency seeks to transition fully to zero-emission buses.

“Investing in hydrogen fuel cell generators ensures County Connection can charge our fleet of electric buses and provide the necessary power to pump fuel to our future Hydrogen Fuel Cell bus fleet during natural disasters,” said Bill Churchill, the agency’s general manager, in DeSaulnier’s announcement. “This will allow us to provide vital public transit service to the communities we serve. We are grateful that Congressman DeSaulnier shares our vision for a future of resilient and reliable transit service.”",transportation safety tech ventures
Cleaner & Safer Vehicles,https://www.icmm.com/en-gb/our-work/cleaner-safer-vehicles,N/A,"There are around 28,000 large mine hauling trucks in operation — collectively emitting over 69 million tonnes of CO2 (Scope 1, an additional 15Mt CO2 for Scope 3), based on 25 billion litres of diesel fuel.

MPS Finalizes Student Investment Plan for Safety & Growth,https://www.mustangps.org/details/~board/momentum-student-investment-plan/post/mps-finalizes-student-investment-plan-for-safety-growth,N/A,"After months of research and planning, the Mustang Board of Education has finalized a capital investment plan to provide students with safer schools, more classrooms, updated facilities and more academic opportunities. Board of Education members voted Monday night to call a February 14, 2023 bond election for Mustang residents to consider the proposal.

“This is an exciting time for Mustang. People want to move here and be part of our outstanding community and schools,” Superintendent Charles Bradley said. “This investment plan will make a difference for all Mustang students by focusing on pressing needs. We can provide today’s learners with safer schools, improved facilities and more opportunities, while adding classrooms to address current overcrowding and future growth.”

According to a recent demographic study, Mustang’s enrollment is expected to soar to 19,780 students over the next nine years – a 46% increase from the current school year. The district’s long-term capital investment plan will allow the district to keep pace with future growth, while also minimizing the impact to local taxpayers. The plan includes construction of a new elementary school to address the exponential enrollment growth of recent years. In addition to classrooms, it will include secure entrances, a cafeteria, a gymnasium, a library and developmentally appropriate playgrounds. To accommodate growth at the secondary level, Mustang High School will receive an expansion that includes new classroom space and a new cafeteria, along with a new practice gym, athletic turf projects and upgrades to the softball facilities.

Many Mustang parents and patrons see the addition of classroom space as critical for the immediate future – not just for the school, but also the community. “Mustang is a great place to live and raise a family – and more people are taking notice every day. Our community is in demand and growing rapidly,” said Michael Ray, MPS parent, local realtor, and Vice Mayor of Mustang. “This plan allows us to ensure we have the classroom space we need for every child. It’s an investment in today’s students and Mustang’s future.”

Safety and security are key components of the facility plan as well, including cameras, secured access upgrades and fencing. The high school will expand badge access for students and staff, which will provide added security.

The proposed plan will also provide funding for:

Playground refreshes at elementary and intermediate school sites;

New buses and transportation vehicles to provide students with safe, reliable transportation to and from school and school activities;

Expanded student opportunities, including decreased class sizes and increased instructional time; fine arts and athletic equipment, uniforms, materials and instruments; Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) equipment; and instructional resources;

Upgrades to technology devices for students and staff, along with updates to software and out-of-date classroom technology, like presentation boards; and

Improvements and maintenance for existing school facilities, including lighting, electrical, roofing, flooring and heating/cooling units.

The additional classroom space, safety and security features, and needed school improvements will benefit students and the community, Aaron Tiger, Mustang parent and local pastor, said. “Mustang schools are top notch. Like many families, we have moved into the community in the past five years and experienced the excellence that Mustang schools have to offer,” Tiger said. “Our schools and community will continue to be in demand and a place that people choose to be. If we want a great future for our community, it is important to continue to invest in our students.”

The total cost of the 2023 investment program is $180.9 million. For homeowners with a $100,000 home, the plan would likely cost $1.83 per month in additional property tax. Fortunately, because Mustang’s tax base is stable and quickly growing, previous bond programs have consistently impacted taxpayers less than expected at the time of the election. Currently, Mustang lags behind its 6A peers for the amount spent per student on capital investments. Out of 24 Class 6A districts in the state, Mustang ranks 20th – currently investing $346 less per student than the 6A average. If voters approve the measure in February, Mustang would move to 15 out of 24 for its per student investment.

The 2023 investment program represents the first phase of a three-phase plan to ensure the needs of Mustang’s growing population are met over the next decade. Additional projects will likely be proposed to voters in 2027 and 2031. Financial advisors predict that no additional tax increases will be necessary with the latter two phases. “A long-term vision is important, especially for a growing community like Mustang. I’m pleased that school leaders are developing a multi-phased plan to better serve our students and community,” said Brian Grider, MPS parent and Mayor of the City of Mustang. “They are prioritizing pressing and critical needs, like classroom space and school safety. The district’s financially responsible approach will ensure our investment will make the greatest impact possible.”

Statewide Multimodal Transportation Plan,https://www.minnesotago.org/learn-about-plans/statewide-multimodal-transportation-plan,N/A,"Minnesota is facing many changes.

Minnesota is facing many changes. These shifts—in population, economy, environment, technology, safety and travel behavior—will affect how people and goods move throughout the state. It is important we proactively plan to address these changes, so we can achieve our vision of a multimodal transportation system that maximizes the health of people, the environment and our economy.

That’s why, every five years MnDOT writes a plan for the future of the state’s multimodal transportation network. The document is a statewide policy plan for all users, all modes and any jurisdiction that has a role in Minnesota’s transportation system. It evaluates the status of the transportation system, what’s changing, and how we’re going to move forward over the next twenty years. The work is so important to the success of the future system that it is required under both federal and state law. The SMTP was last updated in 2022.

In addition to the agency’s long-standing commitment to preserving the existing system, the SMTP also includes new opportunities and emphasis areas, including:

Climate: Shifting to a climate-friendly transportation system requires that the transportation system look, feel, operate and be maintained differently in the coming decades. The SMTP includes the following climate action commitments:

Decrease annual greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector by 80% by 2040.

Ensure that all new light duty vehicles registered in Minnesota are zero emission vehicles by 2035.

Reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled across Minnesota per capita 14% by 2040.

Integrate vulnerability identification and resilience into planning and programming.

Develop system and asset resiliency measures.

Equity: The process used to update the SMTP included several activities that embedded transportation equity into the planning approach, including an equity review applied to all the draft strategies and solutions. As a result, equity is integrated throughout the policy direction. The SMTP update includes the following equity commitments:

Build internal capacity to advance transportation equity.

Enhance analysis and evaluation for transportation equity in project selection and project development.

Co-create stories about transportation in Minnesota in collaboration with communities.

Collaborate with partners to evaluate and address equity impacts of transportation fees, fines and fares.

Develop a measure of how much household income is spent on transportation.

Develop measures for transportation equity.

Use a newly developed transportation equity statement of commitment to inform ongoing work.

Health: Changes to transportation can make the system work better for all people and modes. When transportation works well, it improves health outcomes and reduces disparities. The SMTP includes the following public health commitments:

Adopt a Safe System approach to transportation safety.

Increase the percent of Minnesotans who walk or bicycle at least weekly to 60% by 2040.

Develop resources to mitigate urban heat islands.

Develop measures for walking, bicycling and taking transit at a project- and program-level.

The plan is the result of extensive collaboration during the last two years between MnDOT, partners, stakeholders and the public. The four-phased engagement approach has included a variety of ways and opportunities to meet people where they were at. The goal during Phase 1 (completed in early 2021) focused on identifying six focus areas for the SMTP update. The goal for Phase 2 (completed in fall 2021) was to dive deep into each of these six focus areas. The goal for Phase 3 (completed in winter 2021) was to get more feedback on select topics where MnDOT and transportation partners needed more information on how to proceed. Phase 4 (completed in summer 2022) was the public comment period and hearing for the draft SMTP.

More information about public engagement can be found in collection of summaries and in the 2022 SMTP.

Chapter 2 - Literature Review | Practices for Balancing ...,https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/26666/chapter/4,N/A,"Below is the uncorrected machine-read text of this chapter, intended to provide our own search engines and external engines with highly rich, chapter-representative searchable text of each book. Because it is UNCORRECTED material, please consider the following text as a useful but insufficient proxy for the authoritative book pages.

8 This chapter provides an overview of the literature review findings on various HSIP practices reported in both the published literature and online sources that relate to the scope of the synthesis. The literature includes pertinent information from 36 state HSIP manuals as well as additional state HSIP annual reports and FHWA guides related to state HSIP and roadway safety manage- ment programs. AppendixÂ C provides a list of the resources included in the literature review and a summary of individual state DOT practices. The primary information contained in the literature review is based on the state HSIP manuals unless otherwise referenced as another source. This chapter is organized in three sections: project identification, project prioritization, and project evaluation. Each section summarizes current state DOT practices, highlighting differences between basic and advanced practices, quantitative and qualitative practices, and state and local road practices. The project identification section is broken down into three subsections that cor- respond to the three general approaches to roadway safety management: spot, systemic, and sys- tematic. Each subsection describes the quantitative and qualitative approaches state DOTs use to identify projects. The project prioritization and project evaluation sections follow slightly different organization due to overlapping methodologies among spot, systemic, and systematic approaches. For the purposes of the literature review, the term âlocalâ represents roads that are not owned by the state DOT (e.g., roads and highways owned or operated by a county, city, or township agency). Project Identification This section summarizes state DOT practices in HSIP project identification for three approaches to safety management: spot, systemic, and systematic. For each approach, this section summa- rizes state DOT practices and notes differences with respect to quantitative and qualitative methods as well as differences on state and local roads. Appendix C provides further details on specific approaches state DOTs used in spot project identification and whether the approach applies to HSIP projects on state roads, local roads, or both. Spot Agencies typically follow the six-step roadway safety management process documented in the HSM when implementing a crash-based safety management approach (2). For project identifica- tion, many agencies employ the first three steps of this process: (a) network screening, (b) diagnosis, and (c) countermeasure selection. Based on a review of HSIP practices, state DOTs use a variety of safety performance measures for network screening. Of the 52 agencies included in the review of spot project identification approaches, all use some type of quantitative approach for identifying projects on the state or local C H A P T E R 2 Literature Review

Literature Review 9Â Â system. The quantitative approaches range from traditional methods, such as crash frequency and crash rate, to more rigorous and contemporary methods from the HSM that account for regres- sion to the mean and traffic volume [e.g., level of service of safety (LOSS), excess predicted crashes, expected crashes, and excess expected crashes]. As shown in FigureÂ 2, the most common safety performance measures are not based on safety performance functions (SPFs), including average crash frequency and crash rate. Less than one-third of state DOTs are using more rigorous SPF-based methods to identify potential spot locations. For those state DOTs that use SPF-based methods, some developed state-specific SPFs, whereas others calibrated existing SPFs to be used in network screening. FHWA provides a list of state SPF calibration and development efforts on the Crash Modification Factors (CMF) Clearinghouse (6). As shown in FigureÂ 3, there is nearly an even split of agencies that use the same method or a different method to identify potential spot projects on state and local roads. Of the 52 agencies, 28 use the same method and 24 use a different method. Of the state DOTs that documented a different approach to identify projects on state and local roads, the differences were typically based on data availability. For example, more data-intensive methods (e.g., LOSS, excess pre- dicted, expected, and excess expected) would be used on state roads, and more basic methods [e.g., crash frequency, crash rate, and equivalent property damage only (EPDO)] would be used 16 36 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 SPF-based Not SPF-based 28 24 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 Same Spot Project Identification Methods for State and Local Roads Different Spot Project Identification Methods for State and Local Roads Figure 2.

10 Practices for Balancing Safety Investments in a Comprehensive Safety Program on local roads. Similar variations allow the more data-intensive methods to be used on any roads for which enough data are available, regardless of state/local designation. Many state DOTs supplement the quantitative approach with some type of qualitative approach to identify potential project locations. The qualitative approaches typically allow for other stakeholders to help identify potential project locations based on public or political inputs, police requests, or observations by district or regional staff. Based on these inputs and professional judgment, the state DOTs may add these sites to the list of spot locations for further investigation. Although some state DOTs do not provide documentation of the project identification process, those that do use either quantitative approaches or a combination of quantitative and qualitative approaches. None of the state DOTs reviewed in this report use only qualitative approaches for identifying spot projects. Once potential project locations are identified, all state DOTs use more in-depth investigations to diagnose the crash patterns and underlying crash contributing factors. Similar to network screening, the methods range from basic crash summaries and collision diagrams to the use of tests of proportions and multidisciplinary site investigation teams. As shown in FigureÂ 4, the most common methods are crash summaries and multidisciplinary site investigation teams, followed by the use of collision diagrams and tests of proportions. Refer to the survey results in ChapterÂ 3 for more on identifying potential countermeasures, including differences in spot and systemic practices and differences on state and local roads. With respect to countermeasure selection, state DOTs use the diagnosis results to select appro- priate countermeasures that are effective and feasible. Some state DOTs have an approved list of countermeasures and associated CMFs for HSIP projects. For those agencies with an approved countermeasure list, some allow countermeasures beyond the preapproved list with justification of countermeasure effectiveness. To justify countermeasure effectiveness, many require the use of CMFs from the CMF Clearinghouse (7). As shown in FigureÂ 5, 44 agencies use CMFs to justify countermeasures, and just over half of the agencies provide a state-specific list of CMFs for use in the analysis. Relatively few state DOTs preapprove specific countermeasures, but all must meet the HSIP project eligibility requirements in accordance with 23 U.S.C. 148. Systemic Based on the review of available documentation, the majority of agencies include some type of systemic approach, and relatively few do not indicate a systemic approach, as shown in TableÂ 1. 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Crash Summaries Multidisciplinary Site Investigations Collision Diagrams Tests of Proportions 50 45 17 7 Figure 4.

Literature Review 11Â Â Specifically, only five state DOTs do not specify a systemic method on the state system, and only six do not specify a systemic method on the local system. For those state DOTs that do have a documented systemic approach, most identify systemic projects through some combination of identifying focus crash types, facility types, and risk factors; screening and prioritizing candidate locations; and selecting low-cost systemic countermeasures. Although many state DOTs use an approach that is relatively consistent with the process docu- mented in FHWAâs Systemic Safety Project Selection Tool (3), there are several variations of sys- temic project identification. In general, the literature review identified four general categories of approaches for identifying systemic projects: application of in-house tools or methodology, application of FHWAâs Systemic Safety Project Selection Tool, application of a tool unspecified but similar to FHWAâs Systemic Safety Project Tool, and application of the U.S. Road Assessment Program (usRAP) methodology. For state roads, the most common approach is an in-house methodology, as shown in the following examples: â¢ Kentucky divides HSIP projects into five categories [roadway departure, intersections, non- motorized, commercial motor vehicle (CMV), and other initiatives] and uses a tailored identification/prioritization methodology for each. For intersections, Kentucky identifies and prioritizes sites based on a list of attributes correlated with severe crash types. For road- way departure, Kentucky focuses on rural, two-lane, high-speed facilities, then uses the HSM 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Use CMFs to Justify Countermeasures State-Specific List of CMFs Approved List of Countermeasures 44 26 9 Figure 5.

12 Practices for Balancing Safety Investments in a Comprehensive Safety Program methodologies to prioritize route segments based on predicted safety performance, and finally implements targeted improvements while minimizing right-of-way (ROW) and utility conflicts. â¢ Nebraska created a Strategic Safety Infrastructure Projects Team (SSIPT) to identify systemic safety projects that can be implemented on a statewide basis, such as shoulder and centerline rumble strip projects and projects to remove obsolete guardrail. â¢ Washington uses a custom approach for local roads where projects are identified through a local road safety plan (LRSP). The approach identifies and prioritizes projects based on the top crash type(s) in the local jurisdiction. Projects can be at intersections, spot or midblock locations, and corridors. â¢ Wyoming implements systemic improvements that represent corridor, area, or statewide treatments that are generally low cost, and the application is not exclusive to spot locations. The data-driven application of systemic treatments considers the overall statewide crash reduction based on expected widespread deployment. In addition to quantitative approaches, some state DOTs use other resources, such as road safety audits, information obtained from the public, law enforcement agencies, and safety com- ponent reviews of other projects, to identify systemic projects. AppendixÂ C provides further details on systemic project identification approaches based on the literature review and whether the approach applies to HSIP projects on state roads, local roads, or both. Refer to the survey results in ChapterÂ 3 for more on identifying systemic project locations, including differences on state and local roads. In general, it was difficult to discern from the literature if there are differences in countermeasure selection practices for spot and systemic projects. As such, the results shown in FigureÂ 5 for spot projects generally apply to systemic projects as well. For systemic countermeasure selection, some state DOTs, including Michigan, Oregon, and Texas, develop a list of preapproved counter- measures for systemic projects. Other state DOTs require a detailed analysis, similar to spot projects, to diagnose the systemwide crashes and select targeted countermeasures to address the underlying risk factors. For example, New Jersey conducts a risk assessment of locations across the network to select appropriate countermeasures and requires benefit-cost analysis to justify the selected countermeasure(s). Pennsylvania identifies promising cost-effective strategies and then identifies sets of locations where it is cost-effective to apply the strategies. Refer to the survey results in ChapterÂ 3 for more on selecting potential countermeasures, including dif- ferences in spot and systemic practices and differences on state and local roads. Systematic Based on the review of available documentation, a limited number of state HSIP manuals include a documented systematic approach and provide guidance on how to identify systematic projects (see TableÂ 2). The most common method of identifying a systematic project is to select a proven State Documented Systematic Approach for State Roads Documented Systematic Approach for Local Roads California Florida Idaho Kentucky Maine Michigan Pennsylvania ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ ï¿½ Table 2.

Literature Review 13Â Â countermeasure and then apply it to all eligible locations based on the roadway characteristics but not necessarily on a systemic risk-based analysis (e.g., paving unpaved shoulders, installing median barrier on divided highways that currently do not have a median barrier, or installing shoulder rumble strips on all rural roads with paved shoulders greater than 5Â ft). As a result, the project identification process does not include any formal analysis for most state DOTs. There are, how- ever, some state DOTs using quantitative analysis as part of systematic project identification. For instance, Florida suggests the use of network screening results to help identify potential locations and common issues that could be addressed through systematic countermeasures. Pennsylvania determines the number of locations where the countermeasure can be deployed cost-effectively by setting a minimum threshold for the number of target crashes per location to achieve a desired benefit-cost ratio. Project Prioritization and Funding Allocation Based on the review of HSIP manuals and reports, state DOTs use a variety of measures, indices, and factors to prioritize projects and allocate funding. The following sections provide a brief overview, and AppendixÂ C provides further details. Project Prioritization Methods FigureÂ 6 provides a summary of the general approaches state DOTs use to prioritize projects, indicating which state DOTs apply the same prioritization method to all projects and which ones apply different prioritization methods for state and local projects or for spot, systemic, and systematic projects. Based on the documentation, the majority of state DOTs (33 of 52) use the same prioritization approach for all projects, 11 use a different approach for state and local projects, and five use a different approach for spot and systemic projects. State DOTs use a variety of approaches for project prioritization that include quantitative and qualitative factors. As shown in TableÂ 3, ranking by benefit-cost ratio based on estimated reduc- tions in total crashes is the most common method (32 state DOTs). Some state DOTs use specific variations of the benefit-cost ratio to focus on specific crash severities. For instance, Arizona uses a benefit-cost ratio based on reductions in fatal and serious injury crashes for project prioritization. 33 11 5 3 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Same approach applied to all projects Different approach for state and local projects Different approach for spot and systemic projects Not identified Figure 6.

14 Practices for Balancing Safety Investments in a Comprehensive Safety Program Florida uses net present value when it is desired to select projects with higher benefits than the one with the greatest benefit-cost ratio. Florida also uses net present value in combination with benefit- cost ratio to select an eligible alternative that meets the needs of all stakeholders while still advancing the goals of the HSIP. In addition to using benefit-cost ratio or crash reduction as the primary ranking factor, many state DOTs consider other factors such as funding equity, alignment with program goals, and ease of implementation. Some state DOTs develop a weighted average index that accounts for benefit-cost ratio and other factors listed in TableÂ 3. Those state DOTs prioritize projects by applying a standard scoring scheme and summing the results as an index. Funding Allocation Methods As shown in TableÂ 4, 24 state DOTs prioritize all candidate projects together (i.e., no apparent funding split), whereas other state DOTs have set-aside funding or a specific program for certain types of projects. For those state DOTs with funding splits, the most common set-asides are for specific initiatives (14 state DOTs) and spot or systemic projects (12 state DOTs). Other set-aside practices included separate funds for state and local projects (three state DOTs) and Factors Number of State DOTs State DOTs Benefit-cost analysis 32 Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia Project cost and available funding 12 Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Montana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin Ease of project delivery and schedule 10 Alabama, Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Maine, Nebraska, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia Crash or crash severity potential 7 Alabama, District of Columbia, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia Alignment with program goals or focus areas 6 Alabama, Arizona, District of Columbia, Louisiana, Minnesota, Nebraska Engineering review 4 Alaska, Oregon, Vermont, Virginia Other impacts (e.g., ROW, environmental, operational, utilities) 4 Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska Project coverage and funding equity 3 Florida, Michigan, Minnesota Public requests, public acceptance, and political influence 3 Florida, Maryland, Vermont Coordination with other planned projects 2 Florida, Michigan Familiarity with countermeasure (design, construction, and safety effects) 2 Arizona, Florida Holistic effectiveness (4 Eâs of safety [engineering, education, enforcement, and emergency medical services]) 1 Arizona Combined score (including multiple factors from above) 7 Alabama, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia Table 3.

Literature Review 15Â Â separate funds for districts (two state DOTs). Note that the numbers in the table sum to more than 52 because some state DOTs use multiple set-aside methods. Although some state DOTs split funding between spot and systemic projects or state and local projects, few of the reviewed state DOTs have a formula to allocate funding between these projects. Instead of using a specific formula, some state DOTs have established goals for allocating HSIP funding to specific groups of projects (e.g., state/local or spot/systemic). The following is a summary of state HSIP funding allocation goals: â¢ Alabama: Alabama allocates 50% of its federal HSIP funding to systemic projects and 30% to spot projects. For the remaining funds, Alabama allocates 7.5% to safety studies, 5.0% to safety research and data collection, 3.0% to enhanced enforcement activities, 2.5% to safety outreach programs, and 2.0% to miscellaneous programs and projects. Alabama may adjust the alloca- tions depending on the various needs and types of project requests from project sponsors. â¢ Arizona: Arizona selects projects on the same funding level, with priority given to projects with the highest benefit-cost ratio. The state DOT allocates no more than 20% of HSIP funding to systemic projects unless special circumstances dictate otherwise. â¢ California: California established the state-funded Systemic Safety Analysis Report Program (SSARP) in 2016. In OctoberÂ 2015, Caltrans set aside $10Â million in HSIP funds for SSARP (8). Local agencies can submit applications for reactive (spot) projects based on benefit-cost ratio or for proactive (systemic) projects based on funding set-asides. The funding set-asides are for low-cost proactive countermeasures on local roads. The set-aside funding is generally 25% of the local HSIP funding, and the amounts are determined based on feedback from the Local HSIP Advisory Committee and previous HSIP cycle applications. In more recent funding cycles, the set-aside amounts increased for local systemic projects, as shown in FigureÂ 7. This was due to the demand for those funds and a recognition of the importance of investing in proven counter- measures (9). â¢ Indiana: The program goal for the Indiana DOT safety program is to obligate approximately 50% of available HSIP funds to systemic improvements annually. Actual obligations for sys- temic projects vary year to year due to project production factors and diversion of projects for obligation under the Section 164-HE Penalty Transfer. Indiana also allocates one-third of the total annual apportionment of HSIP funding to local public agencies for safety projects on local public roads. An annual apportionment of obligation authority is assigned to each metropoli- tan planning organization (MPO) serving Group 1 and Group 2 urban areas. A standardized population formula is used to determine allocation of all federal-aid funding made available to individual MPOs. For public agencies in rural areas, Group 3 (incorporated cities and towns) and rural Group 4 (counties and unincorporated towns), a predetermined amount of HSIP funds are made available for eligible projects. The population formula is also used to determine the total amount of the HSIP allotted for projects located in rural areas (10).

16 Practices for Balancing Safety Investments in a Comprehensive Safety Program â¢ Iowa: Iowa creates a $2 million set-aside of HSIP funds each fiscal year for the HSIP Secondary Program, which replaces the historic High-Risk Rural Roads (HRRR) Program. â¢ Kentucky: Kentucky HSIP projects are divided into five categories: roadway departure, inter- sections, nonmotorized, CMV, and other initiatives. FigureÂ 8 shows the distribution of HSIP funding among all initiatives (11). â¢ Michigan: Michigan has focused HSIP expenditures on spot improvements with an annual average distribution of approximately 40% to 50% for systemic improvements between FY 2014 and 2018 (FigureÂ 9). However, this distribution varies significantly between state and local routes. HSIP expenditures on state routes have focused primarily on systemic improve- ments with an annual average of approximately 54%, whereas HSIP expenditures on local routes have focused on spot improvements with an annual average of approximately 85% (12). Michigan set HSIP funding allocation goals for FY 2021 at 45% for spot projects and 55% for systemic projects. â¢ Minnesota: For HSIP projects, Minnesota balances HSIP funds among spot and systemic projects by focusing on a mix of risk mitigation and historical crash consideration. Beyond the HSIP, Minnesota supports a district safety set-aside to ensure that priority safety items outside the HSIP have an opportunity to be funded. Practices vary among the districts regarding non-HSIP safety set-aside funds to implement improvements. â¢ Missouri: Missouri distributes HSIP funds to each of the seven districts based on a 3-year average of the number of fatalities and serious injuries in each area. â¢ New Jersey: New Jersey has set annual HSIP funding allocation goals based on Strategic Highway Safety Plan (SHSP) emphasis areas and the distribution of fatal and serious injury crashes among state and local jurisdictions. The funding split is approximately 40% on state roads and 60% on county and municipal roads, which aligns with the current distribution of serious injuries and fatalities. â¢ North Carolina: North Carolina divided HSIP funding among three target crash types in 2020: roadway departure crashes (50%), intersection crashes (35%), and pedestrian and bike crashes (15%). Within each target crash type, North Carolina further apportioned HSIP funding between spot and systemic projects. Systemic projects received 80%, 40%, and 40% of allocated funding for the roadway departure program, intersection program, and pedes- trian and bike program, respectively. â¢ Oregon: Within regions, total funding is divided equally between the spot and systemic com- ponents. Within the systemic component, Oregon recommends that regions split funding Source: California Department of Transportation (9). $0 $50 $100 $150 $200 $250 M ill io ns HSIP Cycle BCR Set-Aside 81% 19% $220 10 81% 19% $184 9 89% 11% $209 8 100% $160 7 Figure 7.

18 Practices for Balancing Safety Investments in a Comprehensive Safety Program between the emphasis areas identified in the Transportation Safety Action Plan (TSAP) based on the proportion of the fatal and serious injury crashes occurring within those categories within the previous 5Â years. The current emphasis areas are roadway departure, intersection, and bike/pedestrian. â¢ Pennsylvania: Each year, Pennsylvania receives approximately $97 million in HSIP funding. The department distributes $45.5Â million of this funding to its planning regions based on fatalities, major injuries, and reportable crashes. Each planning organization receives $500,000 to allow for larger projects in the smaller planning organizations. The remaining $35 million is awarded annually to implement low- to moderate-cost systemic infrastructure safety improvements. Thus, approximately 36% of total federal HSIP funds are used for systemic improvements. â¢ Rhode Island: Rhode Island plans to split funding 90/10 for systemic and spot projects, respectively. â¢ South Carolina: South Carolina allocates HSIP funding based on the SHSP crash categories and emphasis areas. The funding for these emphasis areas is as follows, with some overlap between categories: roadway departure ($20Â million), Interstate Safety Program ($11 million), Rumble Strip Program ($9Â million), intersections and other high-risk locations ($18Â million), Intersection Safety Program ($13 million), Road Safety Assessments Program ($5Â million), and nonmotorized users ($5Â million). â¢ Texas: Texas allocates 40% of HSIP funding to systemic projects, of which 62.5% is for district systemic projects and 37.5% is for systemic projects on the state system. â¢ Vermont: Vermont allocates 60% of HSIP funding for spot projects and 40% for systemic improvements. Project Evaluation Evaluations help to assess the effectiveness of the HSIP. Project-level evaluations help to explain whether an individual effort or investment was successful at correcting or addressing the crash contributing factors at a given location. Countermeasure-level evaluations are useful to estimate CMFs and inform future investment decisions. Program-level evaluations reveal the effectiveness of the HSIP or subprograms in reaching established goals and reducing the number of fatal and serious injury crashes. This section focuses on state DOT practices for project-level and countermeasure-level evaluations. It does not separate practices by state and local roads or spot and systemic approach, because these differences are not readily apparent in the literature. Refer to the ChapterÂ 3 survey results for further details on differences in evaluation methods by facility type (state and local roads) and approach (spot and systemic). Based on the review of HSIP manuals and annual reports, HSIP evaluation methods vary by state DOTs in terms of both breadth and depth of analysis. Within a state DOT, the evaluation method appears to be the same for all projects regardless of how the projects were identified or prioritized (e.g., identified by spot, systemic, or systematic approaches or implemented on a state or local road). Evaluation methodologies are primarily quantitative in nature and range in the rigor of analysis. Some state DOTs use methods that differ in rigor within the HSIP. For instance, North Carolina uses simple beforeâafter methods to evaluate spot projects but uses a more rigorous method for evaluating systemic projects. This is primarily due to the fact that systemic projects are more similar to countermeasure-level evaluations and include multiple treated locations, in which case North Carolina uses more reliable beforeâafter methods. The most common approach to evaluating the safety effectiveness of HSIP projects is the simple beforeâafter study design without traffic volume correction. Relatively few state DOTs use anything more rigorous, such as beforeâafter with traffic volume correction, shift of

Literature Review 19Â Â proportions, empirical Bayes (EB) beforeâafter study design, or experimental beforeâafter study design, as shown in TableÂ 5. State DOT guidance on HSIP project evaluations can range from detailed evaluation procedures to acknowledgment of an evaluation process to no reference of evaluations at all. AppendixÂ C provides summaries of the evaluation methods by state DOT, as identified in state HSIP guidance and reports. Chapter Summary This chapter summarized state HSIP practices for identifying, prioritizing, and evaluating spot, systemic, and systematic projects on state and local roads. The literature review included HSIP manuals from 36 state DOTs as the primary source of information. HSIP annual reports and select national HSIP guides and resources served as supplemental sources of information. The process to identify, prioritize, and evaluate spot projects is fairly well established, as evidenced by the documentation in most state DOTs, but there are fewer state DOTs with a documented systemic or systematic approach. Project Identification Although the traditional quantitative performance measures for network screening (e.g., crash frequency and crash rate) are most common for spot projects, there are several state DOTs that have implemented more rigorous and contemporary methods from the HSM (e.g., LOSS, excess predicted, expected, and excess expected crashes). Once potential project loca- tions are identified, nearly all state DOTs use more in-depth investigations to diagnose the crash patterns and underlying crash contributing factors. The diagnostic methods for spot locations range from basic crash summaries and collision diagrams to the tests of proportions and multidisciplinary site investigation teams. The diagnosis results typically inform counter- measure selection, but some state DOTs provide further guidance, including an approved list of countermeasures and a list of CMFs. Based on the review, approximately 75% of agencies include some variation of the systemic approach in the HSIP manual, and nearly 90% include some mention of a systemic approach in the HSIP manual or annual report. The methods range from basic to advanced, with the majority of state DOTs using more basic approaches to systemic analysis.

20 Practices for Balancing Safety Investments in a Comprehensive Safety Program selection, several state DOTs select from a list of preapproved countermeasures. There are several variations of systemic approaches in practice, including the following: â¢ In-house tools or methodology (32 state DOTs) â¢ FHWA Systemic Safety Project Selection Tool or similar (18 state DOTs) â¢ usRAP methodology (two state DOTs) For both spot and systemic approaches, most state DOTs use the same method to identify potential projects on state and local roads. Of the state DOTs that use a different approach, the justification is typically related to data availability (e.g., using more reliable methods as data allow). Also, many state DOTs supplement the quantitative spot and systemic approaches with qualitative input from stakeholders (e.g., public inputs, police requests, or observations by dis- trict or regional staff) to help identify potential project locations. A limited number of state HSIP manuals include a documented approach and guidance on how to identify systematic projects. The most common method is to select a proven countermeasure and then apply it to all eligible locations. As a result, most systematic project identification pro- cesses do not include any formal analysis. Some state DOTs do use quantitative analysis as part of systematic project identification to justify the widespread application of countermeasures. Project Prioritization State DOTs use a variety of measures, indices, and factors to prioritize projects. The most common quantitative approach to project prioritization is the benefit-cost ratio. Most state DOTs that compute the benefit-cost ratio base the estimate on expected reductions in total crashes; however, some state DOTs use variations, such as benefits based on expected reductions in fatal and serious injury crashes. Many state DOTs also incorporate one or more non-crash-based factors, such as funding equity, alignment with program goals, and ease of implementation. Funding Allocation Some state DOTs prioritize all candidate projects together, and some have set-aside funding for state and local projects, spot and systemic projects, or specific emphasis areas (e.g., roadway departure, intersection, pedestrian, bicycle). Although some state DOTs split funding between spot and systemic projects or state and local projects, few of the reviewed state DOTs have a formula to allocate funding between these projects. The most common quantitative approaches to allocating funding are based on the distribution of fatal and serious injury crashes. Other state DOTs have established funding allocation goals based on qualitative assessments and profes- sional judgment. Project Evaluation Project evaluation methods vary by state DOT in terms of both breadth and depth of analysis. The simple beforeâafter study design without traffic volume correction is the most common project evaluation method. Relatively few state DOTs use anything more rigorous, and state DOT guidance on project evaluations ranges from detailed procedures to acknowledgment of an evaluation process to no reference of evaluations at all.

Road Safety Professional (RSP)®

WHAT IS CERTIFICATION?

Certification is a voluntary process through which individuals are recognized for specialized knowledge and skill in a specified field of endeavor. The purpose of voluntary certification is to enhance public safety and welfare by providing assurance that the certification holder possesses the knowledge, skills and abilities required to provide services to the public at a professional level with a competence which will safeguard life, health and property and protect the general public welfare.

Voluntary certification is firmly established in such professional areas as accounting, financial planning, association management and medical specialties. Increasingly it is being established in engineering specialties such as environmental, irrigation and corrosion engineering; and now, traffic operations engineering!

WHY CERTIFICATION?

The process of licensing professional engineers, as is practiced in North America, provides the public with an important assurance that the holder of that registration has demonstrated acceptable knowledge and skill in basic engineering areas: civil, electrical, mechanical, etc. Comparable credentials exist in some other countries.

However, as engineering knowledge and practice have expanded, it has become more difficult for decision-makers to discern which practitioners hold skills appropriate for practice in the growing number of engineering specialties. State and provincial registration agencies have found it impractical to expand into these specialty areas.

Voluntary certification seeks to meet this need by providing an additional credential which the public, employers and clients can rely upon to assure that the required specialty skills and knowledge are held.

WHY SHOULD I BE CERTIFIED?

The certification process is designed to protect and promote the public safety and welfare. However, it must and does offer value to the certificate holder; it must, because obtaining certification takes time and hard work and out-of-pocket costs to travel to and sit for the examination. Keeping the certification valid requires the holder to pay attention to regularly upgrading knowledge and skills through continuing education.

In both public employment and private practice, public, regulatory bodies, clients, co-workers and employers will accept the professional competence of the certification holder. Certification as a Professional Traffic Operations Engineer® is a powerful demonstration of requisite knowledge, skill and ability in the specialized application of traffic operations engineering. It is a long-term investment in one's professional career, which can be presented with pride! Perhaps the greatest benefit of holding certification is self-satisfaction; the certification holder has been tested and demonstrated that his or her knowledge and skill meet exacting and objective criteria!

WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATION AS A PROFESSIONAL TRAFFIC OPERATIONS ENGINEER®?

The primary requirement is that the applicant passes a professionally created written examination. However, to be admitted to the examination, the applicant must hold a valid license to practice civil, mechanical, electrical or general professional engineering if he or she resides in any jurisdiction issuing such registration. Applicants from countries that do not license professional engineers must submit evidence that they have professional status in their country equivalent to professional licensure in the United States or Canada.

The applicant must also have at least four years of professional practice in traffic operations engineering. (Advanced education may be substituted for some of this experience.)

DEFINITION OF A PROFESSIONAL TRAFFIC OPERATIONS ENGINEER®

A Professional Traffic Operations Engineer® is a person who applies a comprehensive knowledge of technology and scientific principles acquired through study and experience to the supervision of day-to-day operation of traffic systems. Responsibilities often include the analysis of those operations, detection of problems and deficiencies, setting of priorities, assignment of resources and development of improvements in operations through geometric design, traffic control or other means. The Professional Traffic Operations Engineer® may carry out some but not all of the above duties or serve as a consultant to individuals with the above responsibilities.

Traffic Operations Engineering generally includes:

Traffic Operation Analysis

Operational Effects of Geometric Designs

Traffic Safety

Traffic Control Devices

Traffic Engineering Studies

Social, Environmental and Institutional Issues

WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE PTOE TO PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING REGISTRATION?

The certification process which has been adopted for Professional Traffic Operations Engineers® requires that the holder be a licensed professional engineer if he or she practices in the United States, Canada or any other country that provides governmental licensing of engineers. Thus this certification process builds on and supports the practice of professional engineering registration!

HOW WERE THESE COMPONENTS OF TRAFFIC ENGINEERING SELECTED?

Determining the components of traffic operations engineering started with an extensive review of frequently used textbooks, recognized traffic operations references, professional society programs, periodicals and publications. The initial listing was culled and perfected by two carefully selected study groups of practitioners, employers and academicians. This work was carried out in an independent study sponsored by the National Highway Institute.

A panel appointed by the Institute of Transportation Engineers refined and consolidated this listing and, in 1997, the panel's categories were verified by a professionally conducted validation study involving more than 300 traffic operations practitioners. This final study both confirmed the components of the practice of traffic operations engineering and assigned weights to each element and sub-element based on the perceived importance and criticality of each skill or knowledge area.

This carefully controlled evolution has paid off in the considerable confidence that can be placed in the components and scope of practice which will be certified and in the balance of the certification examination.

THE EXAMINATION PROCESS

The examination for Professional Traffic Operations Engineer® consist of 150 multiple-choice problems and questions created by subject matter experts and verified as objective, relevant and reliable by professional psychometricians following established procedures. The examination are scheduled for six hours. It will be closed book and will require some mathematic applications. However, the examination will not cover knowledge and skill areas which are testified to by professional engineering registration.

The examination is designed to assure that the successful applicant possesses the specialized knowledge, skills and abilities which are required to practice traffic operations engineering at a professional level with a competence which will safeguard life, health and property and promote and protect the general public welfare.

DOES TPCB AUDIT RENEWALS AND SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION?

In the certification and licensure industry, it has become common for a certain percentage of recertification applicants’ attestation materials to be audited and verified. TPCB has been working with its psychometrician at Meazure Learning (TPCB’s certification and licensure testing company) to determine that percentage as well as the process that must be implemented to reapply for its accreditation. TPCB has implemented a policy in which 20% of application materials will be audited which means that the certificant will be required to provide documentation as backup to support the application. Additionally, TPCB must reserve the right to selectively audit individuals in certain circumstances such as:

Individuals who were previously audited and did not meet the standards; Individuals who have been given a hardship; Individuals who may be subject to discipline by the TPCB Board.

WHAT ARE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTIFICATION AS A PROFESSIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNER?

For the Professional Transportation Planner® you must meet all of the following requirements:

Have an accredited master’s or Ph.D. degree in planning or transportation with three years of professional work experience in transportation planning, or have an accredited bachelor’s degree in a transportation, or planning course of study and four years of professional work experience in transportation planning, or have an accredited bachelor’s degree in a non-transportation, or non-planning course of study and five years of professional work experience in transportation planning.

DEFINITION OF A PROFESSIONAL TRANSPORTATION PLANNER®

The Professional Transportation Planner® (PTP®) certification program is designed for candidates who have a wide-range of education and experience in transportation planning. Currently, no other certification program is offered that specifically addresses the work performed by transportation planners. Transportation planning is the discipline that examines and evaluates the potential of future actions to improve movement of people and goods by various modes of transportation in accordance with a set of objectives.

Providing cooperative interaction between the public, transportation professionals and decision makers—transportation planning balances the needs of access mobility and safety with environmental economic and social equity concerns.

Planning generally includes:

Land Use and Transportation Relationships

Needs Assessment for Short- and Long-Range Planning

Transportation System Planning for Short- and Long-Range Goals

Transportation System Evaluation

Public Policy

Environmental Analyses

Plan Implementation

HOW WERE THESE TRANSPORTATION PLANNING COMPONENTS SELECTED?

Determining the components of transportation planner started with an extensive review of frequently used textbooks, recognized traffic operations references, professional society programs, periodicals and publications. The initial listing was culled and perfected by two carefully selected study groups of practitioners, employers and academicians.

A panel appointed by the Institute of Transportation Engineers refined and consolidated this listing and, in 2006, the panel's categories were verified by a professionally conducted validation study involving over 300 planners. This final study both confirmed the components of the practice of planners and assigned weights to each element and sub-element based on the perceived importance and criticality of each skill or knowledge area.

This carefully controlled evolution has paid off in the considerable confidence that can be placed in the components and scope of practice which will be certified and in the balance of the certification examination.

WHAT IS THE DIFFERENT BETWEEN AICP AND PTP CERTIFICATIONS?

The AICP certification is geared to the general planning profession - similar to how a P.E. is to engineering. Within the planning profession, a focus on transportation is a niche discipline (possibly more so than within civil engineering). A professional having an AICP exhibits a knowledge of general planning, but not a focus on transportation. The PTP Certification would be the way to identify that expertise - for both planners and engineers. By obtaining the PTP, the area of planning that is most applicable to the transportation profession is recognized.

WHY WAS THIS CERTIFICATION DEVELOPED

With more than 40,000 lives lost annually on highways in the United States and Canada and the growing attention on improving public safety through initiatives such as Toward Zero Deaths, Vision Zero, and the Road to Zero, the RSP represents an important step forward for the safety profession. The RSP certification provides for professionals involved in a wide array of safety-related disciplines to establish their competency in providing for the safety of the traveling public.

Home - ACT Transport Strategy - Transport Canberra,https://www.transport.act.gov.au/act-transport-strategy/home,N/A,"Our vision for transport is for a world class system that supports a compact, sustainable and vibrant city.

This means providing flexible, reliable and sustainable options for Canberrans to make their journeys. Convenient and connected public transport; high quality environments for walking and cycling; and a road network that allows us to move people and goods safely and reliably across the city. Canberra’s future transport system will give people greater choice over how and when they travel and contribute to our city’s status as one of the most liveable in the world. It will operate as one connected transport network, where people can move between transport modes seamlessly and access transport easily, regardless of where they live, disability or background. It will create a compact liveable city by supporting the delivery of new homes, jobs and services in accessible locations across the city.

At a strategic level, we will employ four main avenues to bring about the transport system of the future.

A future-focused investment framework which supports long-term sustainable benefits of transport to the ACT. This will involve the continued rebalancing of investment towards public transport, cycling and walking while we will continue to invest in the safety and maintenance of our road network.

Refocused network planning and design which will focus on building a single transport network where movement will reflect location and better integrated with land use. Canberra’s transport network will be structured through local, central, orbital and regional links. Different links will prioritise the most efficient and appropriate movement type for that link and surrounding land uses. This will encourage people to make appropriate transport choices depending on their destination, purpose and time of day. In this way, our network will operate to reduce congestion, reduce emissions and support a more liveable city.

We will collaborate with partners across Government and the community to employ the Movement and Place framework to weave transport and places together; improving the social and urban fabric of our city. Importantly, we will work to improve safety on our roads for all road users by employing the Safe Systems Approach. This will support people through any transport choice to make the most of what Canberra has to offer by ensuring road environments are safe for all.

Optimising our infrastructure by embracing the opportunities created through new technology to better manage our network and increase capacity to accommodate future demand and emerging transport modes.

ACT Transport Recovery Plan (PDF 6MB) will lead our efforts to set transport once again on a healthy and sustainable path as we manage the impacts of COVID-19 and transition beyond. The plan will focus on harnessing this opportunity to adapt, improve and innovate, so that we can make the most of this period, for the benefit of all Canberrans, now and in the future.

The reimagining of our transport network which begun through Transport for Canberra 2012-31 has provided Canberra with a once in a generation opportunity to recast expectations of how transport and land use planning can shape the future of our city. Through this strategy, the ACT Government will now build on that foundation, delivering world-class public transport, attractive and viable options for cycling and walking, and a safe and efficient road network to allow Canberrans to connect with a vibrant, liveable and exciting future.",transportation safety tech ventures
Volta Energy Technologies Invests in Our Next ...,https://volta.vc/volta-energy-technologies-invests-in-our-next-energy-to-scale-breakthrough-range-extending-battery-technology/,N/A,"Volta Energy Technologies Invests in Our Next Energy to Scale Breakthrough Range-Extending Battery Technology

$25 million Series A investment round, backed by Volta, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, BMW, Flex, and Assembly Ventures, will accelerate production and development of ONE’s innovative high-energy, low cost battery packs that can double electric vehicle range

CHICAGO (October 18, 2021) – Our Next Energy Inc. (ONE), a Novi, Michigan-based energy storage systems company, today announced a $25 million Series A investment round financed by Volta Energy Technologies and other notable investors, including Breakthrough Energy Ventures, BMW, Flex, and Assembly Ventures. This investment positions ONE to scale up production of its existing products aimed at the important delivery truck and fleet vehicle market and to accelerate product development on its next generation range-extending products for the consumer market.

ONE has demonstrated technologies that can double the range of electric vehicles, a key to increasing adoption. In addition to improving range, ONE is focused on lowering cost with cobalt-free chemistries that don’t pose a thermal runaway risk.

“What makes ONE a particularly attractive investment to Volta is that the company is led by experienced and mature leaders who are innovating at both the cell and the pack level,” said Volta founder and CEO Dr. Jeff Chamberlain. “This combination of technology improvements in engineering design, manufacturing technology, along with chemistry and architecture makes ONE unique, and a technology leader in this regard. In ONE, we see a unique ability to integrate next-generation ideas into to the fast-developing landscape of battery technologies and use cases.”

“Leveraging our Series A investment, ONE will accelerate product development,” said Mujeeb Ijaz, Founder and CEO of Our Next Energy. “We are lucky to have Dr. Jeff Chamberlain and the Volta team join our Series A investors bringing considerable experience and vision to help us create energy storage systems with safer and more sustainable battery chemistries.”

The syndicate investing in ONE, led by Breakthrough Energy Ventures, combines investors with a powerful combination of strategic and financial resources. This group of investors together aims to assist ONE’s leadership in identifying and leveraging technology and supply chain partners, qualifying and informing product design and development plans from a broad market-backed perspective, as well as providing direct manufacturing and market access essential for the rapid commercialization and scale-up of ONE’s innovative battery products.

“Our Next Energy is working to fundamentally reinvent the battery while focusing on sustainability, safety and cost; three key factors which will help speed the development and adoption of battery electric vehicles,” said Baris Guzel, partner at BMW i Ventures. “We are convinced that Our Next Energy has the potential to truly transform the space, and we could not be more excited to join their journey.”

ONE’s approach to designing a more energy dense battery pack using reliable, safe, and well known commercially available LFP cells has already resulted in a battery pack with an energy density of 287 Wh/L – approaching the energy density of the battery cells themselves (378 Wh/L) due to the absolute minimum presence of ancillary components used in ONE’s design. Future products that will incorporate the company’s hybrid design will drive total pack-level energy and range significantly higher.

ONE is a part of Volta’s portfolio of investable technologies and businesses aimed at enabling the ubiquitous global adoption of electric vehicles and renewable power generation, which includes Solid Power, 6K, Conamix, Ionic Materials, and Smart Wires. Volta’s new energy storage venture fund, launched earlier this year, complements Volta’s pledge fund, backed by strategic investors Albemarle, Exelon, Equinor Ventures and Hanon Systems.

“ONE’s business compliments Volta’s other investments and we hope and expect to see synergies develop between ONE and other companies in the Volta portfolio,” said Chamberlain.

Entrepreneurs and investors with promising energy storage technologies are encouraged to contact Volta at www.plusvolta.com/contact.

Indonesia – Sustainable Urban Transport Program (SUTRI ...,https://mitigation-action.org/projects/indonesia-sustainable-urban-transport-program-sutri-nama/,N/A,"Background: In Indonesia, transport is the third largest source of energy-related emissions. The sector caused about 23% of total energy-related CO 2 emissions in the country in 2005, with 67.68 million tons of CO 2 equivalent emissions in that year (BAPPENAS/GIZ, 2011: Indonesian NAMA Framework). Of the different subsectors, road transport is the highest emitter representing around 89% of CO 2 emissions and 91% of energy consumption in the sector. A rapidly growing population (from 206 million in 2000 to 238 million in 2010) and strong urbanisation trends reveal that Indonesian cities are increasingly under pressure for transport capacity. In order to effectively deal with these challenges, the government of Indonesia (GoI) has updated its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). This updated NDC now includes measures such as preparation of urban mobility plans, development of urban mass transit systems, provision of national government support for the development of integrated intermodal facilities and the implementation of urban transport services through a “Buy the Service (BTS)” scheme.

Approach to Transformational Change: The project “Implementation of the Sustainable Urban Transport Programme Indonesia (SUTRI NAMA)” will contribute to transforming urban transport in Indonesia through capacity-building measures. The focus will be on 5 pilot cities. The project will provide technical assistance to local governments through a Technical Support Unit (TSU). This will include assistance for reviewing Transport Master Plans and approaching investment programmes, national grant schemes and the private sector for co-financing.

This project will pave the way for a transformational change in urban transport policy in Indonesia by supporting the development and adoption of framework conditions that will attract public and private investment. Expected co-benefits include less congestion, air pollution as well as improved accessibility to public transport, creation of new jobs and reduced social inequality. The outputs achieved through the TSU’s technical guidance will include developing and implementing a bottom-up urban transport Measurement, Reporting and Verification (MRV) system that initiates systematic monitoring for effective decision-making.

Furthermore, the project will initiate effective budget allocations by the central government for public transport services, infrastructure and non-motorised transport. This will be achieved through developing an efficient mechanism of co-funding from the Ministry of Transportation to local governments which will involve public and private sources as well as international donors. In addition to this mechanism, the project will also strengthen local governments through policy guidance. Under the stand-alone component INDOBUS, conditions for private investments such as parking management facilities, ticketing systems, Non-Motorised Transport (NMT) facilities and advertising companies will be improved.",transportation safety tech ventures

Estimating the Relative Efficiency of Highway Safety ...,https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/transj/v57y2018i2p193-218.html,Автор: YT Tsai,"Highway safety has been one of the most important public policy issues discussed in recent years. Accidents involving commercial vehicles result in many negative effects, both personal and economic. Although the numbers of highway accidents have been declining in the past decade, many people still suffer from the effects of severe highway accidents. As public policymakers struggle to improve safety on our highway system, they are looking for analytical tools to help them assess and leverage the impact of scarce public resources. This research effort used data envelopment analysis (DEA) for benchmarking the efficiency of public policy factors (regulatory and financial) known to have an influence on safety performance. The results of this research can provide objective safety performance and improvement recommendations for commercial transportation and therefore serve to be instructive to those states with lower levels of safety performance. Our findings suggest that government agencies could focus on more effective policymaking (emphasizing road condition improvement and capital outlay utilization vs. other investments) to reduce highway fatality rates.

Third-Party Logistics Provider Selection for Sustainable ...,https://www.acadlore.com/article/JUDM/2023_2_1/judm020101,N/A,"Last-Mile Delivery (LMD) describes the final and one of the most important and sensitive phases of the shipping process [1]. This is the phase where the final customers receive the ordered shipments at their addresses. Due to globalization as well as the rapid development of e-commerce, there is a notable increasing number of online orders. The other reason for the increasing number of online orders is the epidemiological situation all over the world. People would rather explore online shops on a website and simply order the desired products to their addresses than physically go there. Bearing that fact in mind, shippers have found themselves in difficulties and doubts, especially in the cities, when it comes to the overall organization of the shipping process. The development of e-commerce markets had opened many questions regarding last-mile delivery [2]. On the other hand, in the last few years, there had been many challenges when performing deliveries due to many of the market risks such as COVID-19, the increase in urban population, and traffic congestion [3]. According to the European Commission document from Brussels [4], at least 30 million zero-emission vehicles would be in operation on European roads and 100 European cities would be climate neutral. Therefore, it is of huge importance to make all transport modes more adaptable and sustainable. From a sustainability perspective, the shippers in terms of last-mile delivery should follow many factors. E-commerce companies that sell their products online must carefully monitor the standards and procedures to make their business more effective and viable. Some e-commerce companies perform the last-mile delivery by themselves, while others contract a third party. One of the issues in the last-mile delivery process is the collaboration with the external business partners i.e., 3PL service providers, and their selection. Since the 3PL providers (DHL, FedEx, TNT, Posts, etc.) is the main connection between sellers and buyers, choosing the right one is significant for sustainable last-mile delivery.

This paper aims to address the 3PL provider selection problem for sustainable last-mile delivery. Namely, an e-shop company from Belgrade should decide on the best 3PL service provider that will perform the LMD of its products to the final customers in the territory of Belgrade. The 3PL selection problem is not so easy task for decision-makers since multiple conflicting criteria interfere in a decision-making process. Nowadays, there are many multi-criteria decision-making methods used to solve this or similar kinds of problems. In this paper, to solve the problem mentioned, the two multi-criteria decision-making methods are coupled. The first one is the Best-Worst Method (BWM) used to find the criteria weights, while the second one is the Combined Compromise Solution (CoCoSo) method used to rank the alternatives from best to worst. In addition, the sensitivity analysis is performed to test the stability of the applied CoCoSo method. Besides, a comparative analysis is done to compare the results with some multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods.

There are some contributions of this paper:

1) For the first time, the BWM-CoCoSo methods are coupled to find the best 3PL alternative for the e-shop company in Belgrade.

2) The BWM-CoCoSo method is applied to a real-life case study in Belgrade which should be seen as a practical contribution.

3) The applied methodology is tested and verified in the case study involving 5 3PL providers. The sensitivity analysis of the applied methods is performed, and the high stability of the results is demonstrated; In addition, the comparative analysis is provided, and the presented results are highly confident.

In addition to contributions, there are certain limitations of this study such as:

i) There are not so many criteria considered in a decision-making process. The identified criteria from the literature were of special interest to the e-shop company’s management who decides on the best 3PL. The six identified criteria were enough according to the e-shop company’s management opinion because the economic, social, and technical pillars need to be tackled.

ii) Since the 3PL selection problem deals with uncertainty, the applied methods are not combined with fuzzy logic. This limitation should be considered as a future research direction of the paper.

The rest of the paper is structured in the following manner: Section 2 reveals the review of the literature in terms of criteria and methods used to solve the 3PL selection problem. Section 3 elaborates on the methodology that is applied to the problem mentioned. Section 4 is the application of the methodology to the real-life case study of the e-shop company from Belgrade. Section 5 gives some general managerial implications on the considered problem. Section 6 concludes and gives future directions for the paper.",3PL sustainability innovations
Mexico's 3PL Market Builds Momentum,https://mexicobusiness.news/mobility/news/mexicos-3pl-market-builds-momentum,N/A,"As Mexico solidifies its position as a nearshoring hub, it will need a strong logistics backbone to address the demands of companies arriving into the country. A recent report by Mordor Intelligence shows that the country’s third-party logistics (3PLs) market is expected to grow at least 38.6% in the next five years, with a compound annual growth rate of 6.75%.

Mexico became the US’s largest trading partner in the first four months of 2023, with a total of US$263 billion in traded goods across both counties during that period. This marks a turning point in the relationship between both countries and sets the stage for even more impressive growth in the years to come.

The remarkable growth experienced by Mexico's 3PL market will be influenced by several factors, such as the evolving nature of supply chains and shifting consumer habits, particularly the rising prominence of e-commerce. According to the Mordor Intelligence report: ""More than two-thirds (67%) of Mexican online consumers now shop cross-border and foreign merchants account for 6% of total online sales.""

In an era defined by technology, adaptability and sustainability, Mexican businesses have demonstrated their ability to meet the dynamic needs of customers, which can be seen in the growth achieved in the past three years. The pandemic, the advent of nearshoring, war and other phenomena have all catalyzed these changes, propelling Mexico's logistics sector into the spotlight.

Recognizing the significance of this industry, the Mexican government has invested heavily in technology and safety initiatives. Projects such as the Notice of Crossing and the Complemento Carta Porte have been implemented to ensure that companies operating within the logistics realms can provide seamless and reliable services. This proactive approach has facilitated smoother operations and granted Mexican businesses a competitive edge.

Mexico has now developed significant importance in several industries, especially in manufacturing and pharmaceuticals, which are set to have increased investments. 3PL companies have emerged as essential players in this sector, offering various services related to supply chain management, from transportation and warehousing to picking, packing, inventory forecasting, order fulfillment and package and freight forwarding.

Building trust has proven crucial in driving the growth of Mexico's 3PL market. The recent success of nearshoring initiatives has instilled confidence in businesses, sparking a notable increase in demand. Additionally, more and more retailers are outsourcing their last-mile delivery services to 3PL logistics companies, primarily due to the availability of live tracking services that enhance reliability and provide customers with peace of mind. By optimizing the supply chain through digitization, more transparent processes and providing the latest technological solutions, companies analyze operational inefficiencies and reduce costs, making their services more cost-effective, efficient and reliable.

The USMCA has further fueled the expansion of the 3PL market in Mexico. This landmark agreement has provided a solid foundation for logistics companies to flourish and continue their upward trajectory by encouraging growth and facilitating trade between countries. As the industry continues to evolve and adapt to the ever-changing landscape of international commerce, Mexico's position as a 3PL powerhouse is set to strengthen. By leveraging the power of technology and embracing sustainability, Mexico's 3PL market is set to shape the future of global supply chains.",3PL sustainability innovations

In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, companies are seeking innovative solutions to optimize their supply chain operations and meet the growing demands of consumers.

Join us as we delve into the multifaceted contributions of 3PL logistics and how it continues to revolutionize the world of warehousing and distribution.

Strategic Inventory Management

Efficient inventory management lies at the core of successful warehousing and distribution operations. 3PL providers bring expertise in inventory optimization, employing advanced technologies and data analytics to ensure optimal stock levels, minimize carrying costs, and prevent stockouts.

By implementing robust inventory control measures and real-time monitoring systems, 3PL partners help businesses achieve greater accuracy, visibility, and responsiveness in managing their inventory, ultimately driving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

Customized Solutions for Diverse Needs

One of the key strengths of 3PL logistics is its ability to deliver customized solutions tailored to the unique needs of each client. Whether it’s warehousing, order fulfilment, transportation, or value-added services, 3PL providers offer a range of specialized solutions designed to address specific challenges and objectives.

From dedicated warehousing facilities to on-demand transportation services, businesses can leverage the expertise and resources of 3PL partners to optimize their supply chain operations and achieve their strategic goals.

International Expansion and Global Reach

In an increasingly interconnected global economy, businesses are expanding their reach across international borders to tap into new markets and opportunities. 3PL logistics plays a crucial role in facilitating this expansion by offering comprehensive international freight forwarding and logistics services.

From managing customs clearance and navigating complex regulatory requirements to coordinating multimodal transportation and optimizing supply chain networks, 3PL providers enable businesses to overcome the challenges of global trade and establish a seamless international presence.

Risk Mitigation and Resilience Planning

The ever-present risks in supply chain management, such as natural disasters, geopolitical instability, and economic fluctuations, underscore the importance of robust risk mitigation strategies. 3PL logistics providers play a critical role in helping businesses identify and mitigate potential risks through proactive planning and contingency measures.

By diversifying transportation routes, establishing redundant distribution centres, and implementing disaster recovery plans, 3PL partners help businesses build resilience and minimize disruptions to their operations, ensuring continuity and reliability in supply chain performance.

Continuous Improvement and Innovation

Innovation is the driving force behind progress in warehousing and distribution, and 3PL logistics is at the forefront of innovation in the industry. From the adoption of emerging technologies such as blockchain, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to the development of sustainable and eco-friendly logistics solutions, 3PL providers are constantly pushing the boundaries of what’s possible.

By embracing innovation and fostering a culture of continuous improvement, 3PL partners help businesses stay ahead of the curve, adapt to changing market dynamics, and seize new opportunities for growth and competitive advantage.

By leveraging advanced technologies and industry best practices, 3PL providers implement lean methodologies to eliminate waste, reduce lead times, and enhance overall productivity.

From automated order processing and inventory replenishment to route optimization and cross-docking strategies, 3PL logistics drives efficiency at every stage of the supply chain, delivering cost savings and operational excellence.

Data-Driven Decision-Making

In the age of big data, actionable insights are invaluable for driving informed decision-making. 3PL logistics harnesses the power of data analytics to extract valuable insights from vast amounts of supply chain data.

By analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs), monitoring trends, and identifying opportunities for improvement, 3PL providers help businesses make data-driven decisions that optimize inventory levels, enhance demand forecasting accuracy, and improve customer service levels.

With real-time visibility into supply chain performance, companies can proactively address issues and seize opportunities for growth.

Sustainability and Environmental Responsibility

As environmental concerns take centre stage, sustainability has become a top priority for businesses across industries. 3PL logistics plays a vital role in promoting sustainability and environmental responsibility within the supply chain.

By implementing eco-friendly practices such as route optimization to reduce carbon emissions, adopting renewable energy sources for warehouse operations, and optimizing packaging to minimize waste, 3PL providers help businesses minimize their environmental footprint while driving cost savings and enhancing brand reputation.

Supply Chain Resilience and Risk Management

In today’s volatile business environment, supply chain resilience is paramount to ensuring business continuity. 3PL logistics aids businesses in mitigating risks and building resilience through proactive risk management strategies.

By conducting risk assessments, developing contingency plans, and establishing robust supply chain networks, 3PL providers help businesses navigate disruptions such as natural disasters, geopolitical instability, and supplier failures. With a resilient supply chain in place, companies can respond swiftly to challenges and maintain operations even in the face of adversity.

Customer-Centric Solutions

In an era of heightened customer expectations, delivering exceptional experiences is essential for maintaining a competitive edge. 3PL Logistics places a strong emphasis on customer-centric solutions, tailoring services to meet the unique needs and preferences of customers.

From flexible delivery options and order tracking capabilities to personalized packaging and returns management, 3PL providers prioritize customer satisfaction at every touchpoint.

What Is Fourth Party Logistics (4PL) & How It Differs From ...,https://www.covenantlogistics.com/articles/what-is-fourth-party-logistics-4pl-how-it-differs-from-3pl,N/A,"In today's digital age, supply chains are evolving into intricate networks. At the same time, the advent of intelligent technology, including artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud computing, is fueling innovation, and driving change.

To stay ahead in this dynamic landscape, a growing number of enterprise-level businesses are choosing to delegate their logistics operations to a Fourth Party Logistics provider, or 4PL.

The global 4PL industry is on a path of steady growth. Projections indicate that the 4PL market, valued at $66.55 billion in 2023, isset to reach an impressive $86.26 billion by 2027.

Both Third Party Logistics providers, and 4PLs can be the ideal solution for your logistics needs, but the nature of the services and partnerships they offer differs.

The choice between the two will depend on several factors, including the complexity of your supply chain, the level of control and involvement you desire, your budget, and the return on investment from your logistics operations.

What Is A 4PL?

A 4PL, or a Fourth-Party Logistics provider takes full responsibility for managing your supply chain. By forging a partnership with a 4PL, you effectively outsource your supply chain management and logistics, transforming your 4PL into the single point of contact for all stakeholders.

4PL providers offer a comprehensive range of services, spanning supply chain planning, optimization, and execution, among others. They manage everything, from overseeing procurement procedures to coordinating with 3PLs.

It's worth noting that North America, thanks to its burgeoning logistics industry, currently leads the 4PL logistics market.

What Is A 3PL?

A 3PL, or Third-Party Logistics provider, specializes in a diverse array of logistics services, such as transportation, distribution center management, and fulfillment. While some 3PLs may not own assets, many, like Covenant, have their own infrastructure.

Depending on the unique needs of your business, 3PLs can strategize and execute your entire logistics process or only certain aspects of it, like transportation, fleet management, and warehousing.

Today, leading 3PLs are expanding their supply chain services beyond traditional third-party logistics to offer their customers a complete logistics solution.

As one of the nation's most prominent 3PLs, Covenant is committed to engineering value-driven supply chains and optimizing processes to ensure businesses can deliver their products swiftly and efficiently.

4PL Vs. 3PL

The main distinction between 4PLs and 3PLs lies in their approach. A Third-Party Logistics provider typically manages the logistics of physical goods, working closely with a business.

In contrast, a 4PL provider handles all matters related to the supply chain in an outsourced business model.

Area Of Focus

3PLs concentrate on specialized logistics services and manage processes tied to the physical movement of goods. 4PLs oversee the complete supply chain management, particularly in international trading. They handle all supply chain processes, including exports, clearance, 3PL warehousing, finance, and the coordination of 3PLs.

Infrastructure

3PLs may own their own fleet of trucks and have a robust carrier network, providing a wide array of parcel or freight transportation services, from LTL shipping to managed transportation schemes. 4PLs typically do not have their own resources. Instead, they enhance their clientsâ supply chain by coordinating freight shipping, order fulfillment, supplier management, and more.

At Covenant, we understand the intricacies of logistics and supply chain management. Our expertise as a 3PL provider enables us to efficiently manage warehousing, distribution, and sorting facilities. We optimize processes such as warehouse management and port and drayage operations, ensuring your goods move seamlessly through the supply chain.

Our robust fleet and extensive carrier network empower us to offer a wide range of parcel or freight transportation services, from Less Than Truckload (LTL) shipping to managed transportation. Unlike 4PL providers, which typically do not own resources, we harness our assets to benefit your business directly.

Supply Chain Optimization

In terms of supply chain optimization, we leverage advanced technology to maximize efficiency and sustainability in transportation, warehousing, and reverse logistics. Like 4PL providers, we utilize state-of-the-art technology to coordinate processes and analyze data, optimizing your supply chain from end-to-end.

Communications

As a 3PL, we work directly with you, understanding your unique challenges, devising strategic plans to swiftly address unforeseen issues, streamline operations, and deliver long-term improvements. We appoint a dedicated account manager for each client, providing personalized guidance and rapid resolution of issues.

While a 4PL acts as a Single Point of Contact (SPOC), filtering all communication between stakeholders, this model may lack the personal touch and quick issue resolution found in a 3PL partnership.

At Covenant, superior service is paramount. We continuously assess your logistics operations to identify improvement opportunities and act as a true strategic partner, committed to your success.

What Type Of Logistics Model Is Best For Your Business?

Supply Chain Complexity and Business Size: Small to medium-sized businesses without in-house logistics can greatly benefit from 3PL services. Large enterprises, especially those involved in international trade, often prefer the comprehensive control offered by 4PLs.

Scalability: 4PLs provide comprehensive management across your entire global supply chain and coordination across numerous 3PLs. However,rapidly growing businesses may find a more adaptable and flexible solution with a 3PL.

Involvement and Control: If you prefer an active role in your supply chain operations, a 3PL's direct customer involvement and country-specific solutions for international businesses can be beneficial. Alternatively, if you wish to delegate all logistics and supply chain management, a 4PL could be your ideal solution.

Cost: 4PLs, given their larger scale of services and responsibilities, tend to be more expensive. Depending on your logistics needs, a 3PL might be a more cost-effective solution.

How We Can Help

Your budget and logistics return on investment should be among your top considerations when deciding which logistics model is most efficient for your business.

At Covenant, we are dedicated to innovation and efficiency. We are your one-stop-shop for all your supply chain needs within the U.S. From order processing to supplier management, we craft cost-effective logistics solutions that fuel your business growth.

Top e-commerce growth drivers for 2024,https://techhq.com/2024/02/e-commerce-retailers-need-to-keep-up-with-customer-expectations-and-so-should-their-3pl-providers-if-they-want-to-stay-in-the-game/,N/A,"The bar for online shopping experiences has never been higher than now. For the last few years, retailers have been forced to shift their focus to their e-commerce offerings just to remain competitive. According to the International Trade Administration (ITA), the UK has the third largest e-commerce market in the world after China and industry revenues are expected to have an annual average growth rate of 12.6 per cent by 2025. Customers demand more than just the convenience of browsing and purchasing products online, and this expectation is passed on to the services the retailers use.

Third-party logistics (3PL) companies play a pivotal role in optimising various aspects of the logistics process, from warehousing and inventory management to transport and distribution. This means they directly impact e-commerce companies’ ability to meet their customers’ evolving expectations. It is, therefore, imperative for 3PL providers to stay abreast of the dynamic preferences of online shoppers and equip themselves with the necessary tools and strategies to facilitate clients’ requirements.

What today’s online shoppers are looking for

More delivery options

Offering a comprehensive set of delivery options, like same-day, next-day or nominated delivery, means that retailers can satisfy diverse preferences and provide a personalised delivery experience. A recent study from GFS found that 45 per cent of retailers see expanding delivery options as the number one way they can address customer expectations. Inadequate delivery options cost an estimated £7.2 billion in aborted transactions annually and, given the choice, 51 per cent of consumers would prefer to be given multiple delivery options, even if it meant paying extra.

Faster shipping

Huge e-commerce players like Amazon dominate in shipping times, but offering high-speed delivery remains a key growth driver for any merchant. A 2023 survey found that 25% of Under-45s consider delivery speed the most important when making an online purchase and choosing a delivery option. It also found that consumers across demographics rank Next Day, Nominated Day and Express Delivery as the top 3 delivery options. 3PLs must be able to offer a wide choice of fast and premium options to keep pace with industry expectations.

Sustainability

Particularly with younger consumer bases that are more accustomed to online shopping, sustainability and transparency are becoming more of a priority. E-commerce businesses embracing sustainability practices, such as eco-friendly packaging, carbon offsetting and supporting ethically sourced products, are witnessing a surge in customer loyalty. Prioritising sustainable initiatives not only resonates with environmentally conscious consumers, but also bolsters brand reputation and long-term growth potential, a trend that will continue as climate awareness grows.

Easy returns

Research has found that consumers rank a difficult returns process as one of their top five frustrations, and one in two UK shoppers are willing to pay extra for a hassle-free experience. However, it is not a priority for retailers, who view outbound delivery services as the primary focus of operations. Bridging this disconnect requires concentrating on improving the returns and inbound proposition to ultimately increase customer satisfaction and loyalty. It will also reduce the likelihood of basket abandonment due to concerns over returns.

3PLs must improve their services to remain competitive

If e-commerce businesses cannot live up to customers’ expectations, there are severe financial consequences. Research by independent e-commerce analysts, Retail Economics, found that one in three baskets are abandoned at checkout due to inadequate delivery options, resulting in approximately £31 billion per year in lost sales. But with high operational costs, lack of in-house technical skills and the multiple delivery carriers necessary to offer high-end services, retailers find it challenging to meet consumer demands independently. The same goes for smooth returns processes, as providing these involves complexities such as reverse logistics, restocking and managing inventory updates.

Many retailers focus on improving their final mile delivery and returns services by evaluating their choice of 3PL partners. It is imperative that fulfilment service providers adapt to requirements for speed, cost and sustainability, or risk losing business. They must expand the range of delivery services offered, both on outbound and inbound returns, so the luxury of choice and convenience can be passed on to shoppers. The traditional way of achieving this would be to onboard and integrate more carriers. However, it can be costly, complex and time-consuming to integrate new services into IT systems and onboard and manage new carrier partners. Plus, such an approach is challenging to scale, as every new carrier or service added has an incremental impact on operational cost, overhead and technical complexity.

A smarter way is to partner with a single multi-carrier partner that can offer a breadth of services for outbound and inbound returns and the technical capabilities for quick and easy integration. By teaming up with just one final mile service provider, 3PLs can extend and enrich their services in order to stand out. This gives access to the breadth of services required for current and future needs all under one contract, one relationship and a one-time technology integration. More importantly, such a partnership allows them to demonstrate to e-commerce brands that they understand the demands of the digital shopper for delivery choice and convenience and its impact on the final purchase decision.

Premium multi-carrier partners offer cost-effective, diverse delivery and returns options, ultimately reducing basket abandonment rates, increasing customer satisfaction and creating growth opportunities. Specialised knowledge, industry connections and economies of scale also enable them to provide a wider array of sustainable options at a potentially lower cost. Further options include electric vans, click-and-collect options and carbon-neutral shipments via offsetting programs. These cater to increasingly environmentally conscious consumers while simultaneously fostering a positive brand image.

Consider GFS

In 2024, a single-carrier approach for delivery is no longer feasible, as the dynamic landscape of e-commerce demands a more versatile and customer-centric approach. Leading multi-carrier management company GFS understands how crucial it is for e-commerce 3PLs to be able to bring their service offerings in line with consumer expectations. Doing so creates a competitive advantage for their retailer customers and themselves as service providers.

As the industry’s first and now largest multi-carrier provider, GFS provides a combined offering of multi-carrier technology and multi-carrier services, all under one roof. Furthermore, their proprietary Enterprise Carrier Management (ECM) suite comes as part of the service, giving its customers the technology tools they need at no additional cost. GFS customers have access to 1000+ carrier services across more than 220 destinations, offering a diverse range of delivery options, plus automated label printing and tracking to expedite order fulfilment. Integration with major e-commerce platforms, such as Etsy, WooCommerce, Shopify, Amazon and eBay, facilitates multi-channel order fulfilment and dispatch.

GFS’ commitment to sustainability shines through via the green shipping alternatives they offer: carbon-neutral services, electric van deliveries and parcel lockers, to name but three.

N2 - The increase in customer complaints on the reliability of 3PL services among online sellers has become prominent in the industry, as confirmed by 3PL service providers in Malaysia. The increase in customer complaints increases the tendency to switch to other 3PL service providers. As Asian markets lead the growth of e-commerce, covering approximately 50% of the global e-commerce market, whether the customer will continue to shop online or not is no longer the issue. Although having the proper logistics provider to support online sellers’ business is crucial, most studies have focused on the online shopper’s perspective and employ the service quality theory. Observably, the satisfaction and reuse intention of the 3PL from the online retailer’s perspective is largely neglected. This study identified the factors influencing the satisfaction and reuse intention of 3PL services among online sellers in Malaysia by employing and expanding the stimulus-organism- response (SOR) theory. A purposive sampling method was employed, and the data were gathered via an online survey among online sellers. Additionally, smart partial least squares (SmartPLS) was applied to test the hypotheses. The results indicated that reliability had a positive effect on satisfaction, and satisfaction had a positive relationship with the reuse intention of certain 3PL services. Moreover, satisfaction mediated the relationship between reliability and reuse intention, whereas price fairness strengthened the positive relationship between satisfaction and reuse intention. The findings enhance studies that employed the SOR theory, particularly relating to online sellers’ behaviour on 3PL services. The findings also benefit online sellers and 3PL service providers to create attractive marketing strategies for business sustainability.

Sustainable Supply Chain Foundation,http://www.sustainable-scf.org/,N/A,"Welcome to the Sustainable Supply Chain Foundation (SSCF). The SSCF funds and conducts research related to sustainability in global and domestic supply chains. It works to identify, assess and contribute to standards, metrics, best practices and emerging technologies that advance sustainability in every aspect of supply chain management. What is sustainable supply chain management? Sustainable supply chain management involves integrating environmentally and financially viable practices into the complete supply chain lifecycle, from product design and development, to material selection, (including raw material extraction or agricultural production), manufacturing, packaging, transportation, warehousing, distribution, consumption, return and disposal. Environmentally sustainable supply chain management and practices can assist organizations in not only reducing their total carbon footprint, but also in optimizing their end-to-end operations to achieve greater cost savings and profitability. All supply chains can be optimized using sustainable practices. Sustainability in the supply chain encapsulates a number of different priorities: Environmental stewardship

Conservation of resources

Reduction of carbon footprint

Financial savings and viability

Social responsibility Supply chain sustainability practices, in order to succeed, must deliver improved environmental performance within a financially viable operating construct. Why a 'sustainable supply chain?' ""Even though we were the first manufacturer in America to offset 100% of the CO2 emissions from our manufacturing plants, these incredible offsets amounted to a rounding error in terms of our total carbon footprint. We realized that our supply chain â whatâs coming in and going out of our plant â represents 80% to 90% of our total carbon footprint. So despite the great things we did in our plant, unless we tackled our supply chainâs carbon footprint, we were nowhere."" âGary Hirshberg, President and CEO, Stonyfield Farms It is clear that, supply chains, for most organizations, have a far greater impact on the environment than any other part of their operations. While most corporate and public focus has been on the sustainable profile of a product, (i.e. its source and whether it is recyclable), there is a need to spotlight and to understand the sustainability issues related to the transportation and distribution of those products. Beyond the obvious benefits of reducing overall carbon footprint, and reducing energy and resource consumption, there are many other reasons why organizations should care about sustainability in their supply chains: Better bottom line â research and experience has proven that sustainability significantly improves financial results.

Consumers and Wall Street recognize the importance of green practices and sustainability -- which more and more drives increased sales and share valuation.

Governmental initiatives in the United States and elsewhere provide tax and investment incentives to companies that employ sustainable practices. In a growing number of regions of the world, sustainable practices are governmentally mandated as law. This trend is escalating rapidly.

Sustainability is equated with corporate social responsibility and stewardship â with being a good global citizen. The positive public relations exposure from identifying and implementing sustainable supply chain practices can yield numerous benefits for companies.

Suppliers and corporate customers are increasingly requiring sustainable practices of their vendors.

The elimination of waste in the supply chain is a hallmark of sustainability.

What is 3PL Logistics? Advantages and types,https://www.ar-racking.com/en/blog/what-is-3pl-logistics-advantages-and-types/,N/A,"Logistics is a key element in companies to maintain competitiveness, agility and effectiveness in a dynamic and globalised business environment. There are many organisations that do not have sufficient resources to manage the storage and distribution of all their goods and therefore decide to outsource their logistics and entrust this service to a 3PL operator.

What is 3PL Logistics?

3PL or Third-Party Logistics, also called outsourced logistics, refers to the services that a company hires from a provider to carry out its logistics, storage tasks, order preparation or transportation of goods.

In this way, the 3PL service provider is responsible for managing the company's goods and ensuring they reach their final destination, acting as an intermediary between companies and their customers.

What does a 3PL logistics operator do?

3PL logistics operators are third-party logistics service providers responsible for managing a company's supply chain.

3PL logistics providers may perform the following functions:

Storage and order preparation.

Inventory management and quality control.

Planning and optimising delivery routes.

Transportation of goods and product delivery to end customer.

Customs services and paperwork.

Advice and consulting on logistics and supply chain issues.

Types of logistics operators (PL)

Logistics operators are classified according to the role they play in a company. They are classified according to Party Logistics or PL accompanied by a number that indicates the services that they offer:

1PL: transportation is outsourced through freight forwarders and the drivers necessary to transport the goods. Companies manage their own warehouses .

transportation is outsourced necessary to transport the goods. . 2PL: the logistics operator is in turn responsible for transportation and storage tasks . However, management continues to be the responsibility of the contracting company , which organises the fleet and material flows.

the logistics operator is in turn . However, , which organises the fleet and material flows. 3PL: the logistics operator, in charge of transportation and storage , is also responsible for the management and organisation of both.

the logistics operator, , is also responsible for the management and organisation of both. 4PL: they are logistics operators that act as consultants and auditors of 3PLs, in order to optimise the activity.

they are logistics operators that of 3PLs, in order to optimise the activity. 5PL: they combine 3PL and 4PL, thanks to their size and experience.

Companies need to optimise their supply chains in one way or another, as do logistics operators, which have to improve their processes to offer increasingly efficient services. For this, it is essential to implement new logistics technologies

Advantages of 3PL logistics

Outsourcing logistics services through third-party providers (3PL) can offer significant advantages to companies:

Economic savings and financial resources

Outsourcing logistics services to a 3PL provider entails substantial financial savings for companies. By not having to make a significant initial investment to establish their own logistics infrastructure, such as the acquisition of means of transportation or the construction of warehouses, companies can allocate these financial resources to other priority areas of their business.

Broad geographical coverage and additional services

Companies specialised in 3PL logistics usually have broad geographical coverage, which allows them to cover an extensive distribution area. They also offer a variety of additional services, such as inventory management, personalised packaging, last mile delivery, etc., that add value to the supply chain and meet specific customer needs.

Optimising time and focus on the core business

By outsourcing certain logistics functions to a 3PL provider, companies can save time and resources, allowing them to focus on the core activities of their business. Delegating logistics tasks frees up internal teams to focus on strategic areas which can drive business growth and competitiveness.

Scalability and competitiveness

Outsourcing logistics through 3PL providers allows companies to benefit from more competitive shipping rates. These providers typically have a broad customer base and a consolidated logistics infrastructure, allowing them to negotiate better prices with carriers and operate efficiently in the supply chain. Additionally, the scalability of 3PL services allows companies to quickly adapt to changes in demand or order volume, without incurring additional fixed costs. Overall, these advantages make 3PL logistics a strategic option for companies seeking to optimise their operations and improve their competitiveness in the market.

Possible disadvantages of 3PL Logistics

While third-party logistics (3PL) offers a number of advantages, it also has some disadvantages that should be considered when considering outsourcing logistics services:

Loss of control

By relying on a third-party provider to manage part or all of the logistics operations, companies may experience a loss of control over certain key aspects of their supply chain.

External dependency

Outsourcing logistics to a 3PL provider can create significant dependence on third parties for the operation of the supply chain. If any problem arises with the third-party service provider, such as delivery delays or service quality failures, the company may face disruptions to its supply chain that negatively impact its operations and reputation.

Possible additional costs

Although outsourcing logistics can help reduce the initial investment and fixed costs associated with internal supply chain management, it can also result in additional unforeseen costs. These may include fees for additional services, charges for changes to service requirements, or any situation other than standard.

In summary, despite its many benefits, it is important to carry out a thorough analysis of the risks and benefits before making a decision about implementing 3PL logistics in a company.

How do you choose a 3PL provider?

This is what we should consider when choosing our logistics operator:

Price: logistics operators have rates subject to the type of goods , shipping method and destination.

logistics operators have , shipping method and destination. Scalability: it is important to assess the logistics operator's ability to adapt to logistics needs.

it is important to to adapt to logistics needs. Technology: choose logistics operators that use technology and automation in their processes .

choose logistics operators that . Reputation: it is important that the company you hire is financially stable and offers an efficient service.

How do you organise a warehouse if you are a 3PL?

Being a logistics operator, the warehouse must be very versatile. Many logistics operators equip them according to customer needs, but, in general, they are normally warehouses that manage the SKU of multiple customers.

This means that each organisation must adapt to different business strategies and determine the type of product rotation based on priorities. In this regard, adjustable pallet racking is the best solution for different specifications and high rotation rates, as it allows direct access to all the goods.

Automated pallet warehouses are also increasingly used by 3PL operators, as they provide high-performance and ensure greater safety and control of all operations.

What does 3PL logistics require from its customers?

For 3PL logistics to work effectively, the cooperation and commitment of customer companies is necessary. Some important aspects to bear in mind are:

Clear and smooth communication between the company and the provider is essential for correct supply chain management.

between the company and the provider is essential for correct supply chain management. Provide clear information about goods and the demand for better planning of logistics processes.

about goods and the demand for better planning of logistics processes. Flexibility to adapt to changes in demand and markets will allow for effective supply chain management.

and markets will allow for effective supply chain management. Collaboration in the implementation of technologies and monitoring systems for greater efficiency in processes.

The importance of the WMS in the 3PL model

For a 3PL operator, the management of goods in storage and their subsequent distribution is equally important. Management in a warehouse of this type not only requires the functionalities associated with a WMS, it also requires control of the logistics of its customers to know what processes they demand and at what time.

In summary, third-party logistics is a tool that can be very interesting for companies seeking to improve supply chain management efficiency. Outsourcing logistics services to a 3PL provider can offer very valuable benefits for a company.

Third-Party Logistics Trends Taking E-Commerce by Storm ...,https://www.envoynetworks.ca/blogs/third-party-logistics-trends-taking-e-commerce-by-storm-in-2024,N/A,"As an e-commerce business owner, keeping up with trends in third party logistics services is crucial to staying competitive. In 2024, several key 3PL trends will significantly impact how you store, ship, and deliver products to meet customer expectations. Partnering with a 3PL provider at the cutting edge of these trends can help future-proof your supply chain and ensure a seamless customer experience.

Automation and Artificial Intelligence Streamline 3PL Operations

Automation and AI are enabling 3PLs to optimize operations like never before. Many 3PLs are leveraging automation to reduce costs, improve accuracy, and increase throughput in their warehouses and transportation systems.

Robotics and automated guided vehicles (AGVs) are handling repetitive, physically demanding tasks like loading, unloading, and moving pallets. AGVs follow programmed routes to transport materials without human guidance, reducing labor costs and the risk of workplace injuries. Some 3PLs are experimenting with autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) that can navigate dynamically changing environments.

Many 3PLs are using AI for route optimization and predictive analytics. AI can analyze huge amounts of data to optimize last mile delivery routes, reducing fuel costs and transit times. AI also enables predictive maintenance by identifying patterns that indicate when equipment needs service. This reduces downtime and ensures maximum operational efficiency.

Automated sortation systems, guided by AI, are able to rapidly scan, sort, and route packages to the correct loading bay or truck. These systems minimize the chance of misdirected shipments and speed up the handling process.

E-commerce companies will benefit from working with tech-savvy 3PLs on the cutting edge of automation and AI. Those able to leverage these technologies will gain significant competitive advantages through reduced costs, improved accuracy and speed, and an enhanced customer experience. The future of logistics will be highly automated, and 3PLs must continue innovating to meet the rapidly changing demands of e-commerce.

The Rise of on-Demand, Instant Delivery

As an e-commerce business owner, staying on top of logistics trends is key to staying competitive. One trend that will significantly impact order fulfillment in 2024 is the rise of on-demand, instant delivery.

With major retailers like Amazon and Walmart raising the bar for fast, free shipping, customers now expect near instant gratification. To meet these demands, third-party logistics providers ( 3PLs ) and carriers are accelerating delivery speeds and optimizing routes.

Same-day and next-day delivery options are becoming standard, and in some areas, delivery within 2 hours of ordering is possible. Companies will need to evaluate if offering expedited shipping and tight delivery windows is feasible and determine how to balance customer satisfaction with profitability. This may require renegotiating carrier contracts, adjusting order cut-off times, and strategically locating distribution centers.

Crowdsourced delivery, where independent contractors handle the last mile of delivery, is enabling faster shipping at a lower cost. However, this model can be difficult to scale and quality may vary. Robots and autonomous vehicles also show promise for shortening delivery times, especially for small parcels in densely populated areas.

Omnichannel fulfillment, a seamless customer experience across channels, will be crucial. Customers expect to order online, in-store or on their mobile devices and receive their items when and how they want. An omnichannel strategy supported by a robust 3PL can satisfy customers and provide a competitive advantage.

To keep up with the pace of change in e-commerce and exceed customer delivery expectations, partnering with an experienced 3PL is advisable. They can help you determine how to implement these trends in a strategic, cost-effective way using their supply chain expertise and advanced technology solutions. Fast, accurate delivery at a fair price - that is the future of e-commerce in 2024 and beyond.

Increased Use of Robotics and Warehousing Technology

Increased use of robotics and warehousing technology will transform third-party logistics in 2024. As an e-commerce business owner, investigating how 3PL companies are implementing these innovations can help you choose a provider poised for efficiency and growth.

Automated Picking and Sorting

Many 3PLs now use automated picking machines, conveyor belts, and robotic arms to quickly locate, retrieve, and sort inventory in their warehouses. These technologies can assemble and pack customer orders with a high degree of accuracy at impressive speeds. Some systems can process up to 1,000 orders per hour. Employing automated picking and sorting reduces costs for 3PLs and allows them to take on more volume without expanding their physical space.

AI-Based Inventory Management

Artificial intelligence optimizes how 3PLs track and allocate inventory. AI-driven software monitors trends in a business’s order data to predict which products are most likely to sell. The 3PL can then position those items in the most accessible areas of the warehouse to speed up order fulfillment. AI also helps 3PLs reorder stock at the optimal time to avoid shortages or surpluses. E-commerce companies benefit from these AI-based inventory management solutions through fewer stockouts, quicker delivery times, and lower overhead costs.

Enhanced Shipping Solutions

Many 3PLs now provide e-commerce clients access to automated shipping stations where workers or robotic arms assemble and label packages for delivery. Some also integrate shipping software that chooses the most economical and expedient carrier based on the destination and type of items in an order. These enhanced shipping solutions get e-commerce orders out the door and on the way to customers as efficiently as possible.

The increasing use of these technologies allows 3PLs to improve productivity, reduce errors, and strengthen their value proposition to e-commerce companies. Choosing a 3PL already investing in robotics and warehousing innovation can help position an e-commerce business for sustainable growth in 2024 and beyond.

Focus on Sustainability and Green Supply Chains

In 2024, focusing on sustainability and green supply chains will be crucial for e-commerce companies. Reducing environmental impact through eco-friendly practices and a lower carbon footprint is becoming increasingly important to consumers.

Implementing sustainable shipping and packaging options are two key ways for e-commerce businesses to go green. Using recycled and recyclable materials that minimize waste, as well as optimizing delivery routes to reduce emissions are impactful steps towards environmentally-friendly operations. For example, choosing biodegradable packing materials, reusable shipping envelopes and consolidating customer orders and shipments can decrease the amount of packaging needed and lower the number of delivery trips required.

Forming partnerships with third-party logistics (3PL) providers targeting sustainability is another way for e-commerce companies to strengthen their green supply chain. 3PLs focusing on environmental initiatives will have the necessary experience and resources to help e-commerce businesses develop and execute eco-friendly strategies. They can assist with waste reduction programs, monitor and report on key performance indicators related to sustainability, and stay up-to-date with the latest green technologies and solutions for supply chain optimization.

E-commerce businesses should also consider obtaining environmental certifications to clearly demonstrate their commitment to sustainability. Certifications like LEED and ISO 14001 require meeting high standards for environmental management systems and green building design. Becoming certified can help build trust and loyalty with eco-conscious customers seeking brands that share their values.

Focusing on sustainability and greening your supply chain is not only good for the environment, but also good for business. With consumers increasingly making purchase decisions based on corporate social responsibility, e-commerce companies will need to make sustainability a priority to gain a competitive advantage in 2024 and beyond. Implementing initiatives with the help of 3PL partners and becoming certified are impactful ways to strengthen your brand and bottom line.

More Partnerships Between 3PLs and E-Commerce Companies

As e-commerce continues to grow, many companies are turning to third-party logistics (3PL) providers to help manage the increased shipping demands. 3PLs that focus on e-commerce are forging partnerships with online retailers to provide customized solutions.

Tailored Services

E-commerce 3PLs are offering services tailored to the unique needs of e-commerce companies. This includes options like:

Identify ways to reduce costs while maintaining a high level of service.

Gain insights into customer preferences and behavior to improve the overall experience.

Partnership Model

The most successful e-commerce 3PLs view the relationship as a true partnership. They take the time to understand the retailer’s brand, business model and challenges. Both parties are invested in the other’s success. These strategic partnerships often last for many years and lead to:

Customized solutions tailored to the retailer’s needs.

Shared knowledge and resources to drive innovation.

Growth opportunities as the e-commerce company scales.

Long-term cost savings through process efficiencies.

3PL Summit: from employees forming a bottleneck to the ...,https://www.supplychainmovement.com/3pl-summit-from-employees-forming-a-bottleneck-to-the-digital-value-chain/,N/A,"3PL Summit: from employees forming a bottleneck to the digital value chain

The pace of change, the turbulence it is causing and the need for agile supply chains – all of these things became clear during the Eye For Transport (EFT) 3PL & Supply Chain Summit held from 30-31 October in Düsseldorf. Human emotions sometimes get in the way of business decisions, according to companies, but at the same time that is one of the key benefits of ‘man’ versus ‘machine’. Human emotions also enable consumers to express their needs – and employees with the right skillsets to successfully identify them. And as for technology, it is being leveraged to optimize processes.

By Marysa Vos

Companies are undergoing digital transformations and shifting their focus. For example, Volker Schmitz, VP Supply Chain at HP, explained that the company has developed a digital value chain. Instead of being internally focused on its own data, HP now makes decisions based on community data and analytics. The technology market is growing, creating a rising demand for the production of computers and printers.

HP is eagerly capitalizing on the need for on-demand cartridges and 3D printers. “Ink is something you have to buy, but only when you really need it”, said Schmitz. HP’s Instant Ink subscription service supplies ink when that time comes. The smart printer transmits a signal when the cartridge is empty, so the consumer never has to go without. Hence, the value benefit of HP’s Instant Ink is ‘convenience’.

Besides that, HP’s 3D printers are helping to improve supply chain efficiency. Schmitz predicted that 3D printing will change the face of the manufacturing industry over the coming years. “3D printing is a catalyst of the fourth digital revolution, and 3D printing has helped HP to reduce 95% of its costs already.” According to the EMEA Supply Chain Operator, it is time to invest and innovate rather than wait and see.

When employees form a bottleneck

The speed of the fourth digital revolution (Industry 4.0) is requiring companies to be proactive and agile to respond to changes in the supply chain. Although the technologies must be transformational, the employees are even more important, stated Dirk Holbach, Corporate VP Supply Chain at Henkel: “Employees have to keep up with the pace of change, because they form the bottleneck when it comes to new technologies.”

Luis Miguel del Saz Rodríguez, Head of Digital Transformation Ordering & Logistics PZ at Airbus, echoed the importance of employee development. “You need to know a little bit about everything and always be open to learning more”, said Del Saz Rodríguez. But he added that companies who want to retain the right people and expect their workforce to keep up with the pace of change also have to meet employees’ needs: “If you want to attract millennials who have knowledge and experience of new technologies, you will need to offer them something in return.”

Keeping emotions out of forecasts

In the manufacturing sector, Industry 4.0 advancements such as artificial intelligence and machine learning will change the face of the workforce as we know it. According to Holbach, one of Henkel’s most important trump cards is that the company has employees with the right skillsets: “Last year we recruited people for roles with very different profiles than in the previous year.” He foresees a future in which there will be less interaction between people and processes as a way of keeping emotions out of forecasts, but he believes that ‘man’ and ‘machine’ will continue to collaborate in order to improve performance.",3PL sustainability innovations
Logistics Sustainability?: Long Term Technology ...,https://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jms/article/view/46516,N/A,"Abstract

This study examines the investment in technology over time in an effort to achieve sustainability and secondarily to support green initiatives by minimizing environmental impacts. The literature suggests integrated supply chain contractors emphasize efficiency and flexibility which leads to organizational performance improvements. This study compares productivity changes in the logistics industry measures after significant RFID investments over time. Productivity ratios collected for the fiscal years of 2000-2013 from financial statements are used to investigate technology investments effects.Since 2003, many end users (Wal-Mart specifically) mandated the implementation of RFID technology as one part of a larger system in reaching long term sustainability objectives. Historically, B2B customers and retailers have either built in-house logistic systems or have relied on either shippers services, i.e., third party logistic suppliers (3PL) or independent fourth party logistic suppliers (4PL). Logistic companies that have invested in logistical technologies aimed at sustainability strategies have improved financial ratios during the period studied. Interestingly, companies who have not fully implemented technology enhancements because of logistic service type have not seen improvements in productivity at the same level as others in the supply chain during this same period.",3PL sustainability innovations
What is a 3PL? A Retailer's Guide to Third-Party Logistics,https://www.zendbox.io/post/what-is-a-3pl-a-retailers-guide-to-third-party-logistics,N/A,"Predicted to nearly triple in market size by 2030, third-party logistics (3PL) has become the go-to strategic imperative for eCommerce retailers, who want to maximise their growth. As competition has increased in the 3PL space, the need to differentiate, and offer value-added features has too. While in the past, fulfilment warehousing was more of a commodity, providers are innovating, offering features such as inventory analysis, customs clearance, manufacturing, outsourced customer service and sustainability initiatives.

The history of third-party logistics

Since the dawn of agriculture, there was a need to store and stockpile goods: âArchaeological evidence indicates that the Ancient Egyptians were highly skilled in designing logistical systems. Further, the core goals (transportation, sourcing of raw materials, distribution of the essentials of life and war) of logistics found in Ancient Egypt have largely remained the same in modern business logistics - only the technology and execution of those goals has matured.â

It wasnât until the industrial revolution, and mass production of products, that warehousing and storage was perceived as an efficiency-driver. It was the technological revolution in the 1960s, that the first automated storage and retrieval systems were developed, which were the basis for future warehouse management systems (WMS).

The birth of online commerce in the 1990s led to exponential growth in demand for fulfilment centres, and increasingly sophisticated order processing technology.

The current state of 3PL services

Ecommerce fulfilment, and related search terms, are typed into Google tens of thousands of times each month, and according to Google Trends, this has been an upward trajectory:

The global 3PL fulfilment market size was valued at $97 billion in 2022, and a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.9% is anticipated until 2030. If we take 1.139 and times it by the power of 8 (years), this is equivalent to 283% growth over this time period.

How 3PLs work for eCommerce retailers

Working with a 3PL is a multi-stage process, that begins with shopping around to find the right one. This involves assessing their warehouse locations, their clientsâ feedback, eCommerce platform integrations, carrier partners, pricing, and metrics such as picking accuracy. A recent study found 77% of negative reviews are related to post-checkout, i.e. order processing, delivery, returns and customer service, so something else to consider is to check 3PLsâ clientsâ customer feedback, from consumers.

Once you have found a your ideal 3PL, this is where negotiation begins, and agreeing on KPIs (key performance indicators), along with OKRs (objectives and key results), to ensure you are aligned in terms of your performance expectations. Once your contract is signed, this is where client onboarding begins.

During onboarding, you will be introduced to your account manager, and the 3PLâs technical support team will integrate their WMS with your sales channel(s), for example Shopify, eBay and Amazon. Your product range will be mapped out against available shipping options, taking into consideration dimensions, weight, insurance and customs requirements.

Your supplier(s) will now ship to the fulfilment centre(s), at which point the âgoods-inâ team break down your pallets and containers, and distribute the products to picking locations. At point of sale, a picking note is generated, which is an instruction for the picking team to collect your order, ready for packing and shipping.

At the packing station, orders will be arranged by courier provider, ready for collection. The 3PL will have established relationships with domestic and international courier providers, and will receive collections on a daily basis.

The later the carrier can collect from the 3PL warehouse, the later the retailer can offer services such as ânext-day deliveryâ, later into the evening. Complete Strength, a Shopify merchant, has been able to acquire new customers, thanks to Zendboxâs industry-leading 10pm order cut-off time:

Founder, Rob Whitfield added: âThe majority of our orders will come in of an evening. When we had an earlier cut-off time, we missed out on sales. Now weâve got a later cut-off time with Zendbox, we get less abandoned carts. We have also noticed customers are shopping with us simply because of the later cut-off time.â

Once your orders are with the carriers (e.g. DHL, Parcelforce, DPD, FedEx), your customers will receive tracking notifications, and depending on carrier service selection, in-flight delivery options, such as the option to create a âleave safeâ location, live courier van location tracking, and timed delivery windows. After receipt of goods, consumers may want to make a customer service query, and in some instances, return their goods. Some 3PLs can support with these processes too.

The different types of logistics outsourcing (and insourcing)

3PLs are the most common type of logistics outsourcing, and vary in terms of integrations, product types, client locations, and other variables such as customisation, scalability, storage preferences (e.g. dry or frozen), and some fulfilment houses specialise in garment cleaning and ironing, ready for resale. But there are other types, ranging from first, to fifth-party logistics.

1PL vs 2PL vs 3PL vs 4PL vs 5PL:

1PL is when a company delivers its own goods to the customer. Some major high street retailers have their own delivery vehicles, such as Currys, who offer both delivery and installation via their own network.

2PL refers to parcel, packet and mail courier firms, such as DHL, Parcelforce, UPS and Royal Mail.

3PLs are fulfilment centres, who work with shipping carriers.

4PLs are firms that look after the outsourcing of fulfilment on your behalf, such as annually reviewing pricing and negotiating contracts.

Specialising in deeper supply chain support, 5PLs look after the outsourcing of multiple fulfilment centres, and even elements such as manufacturing.

Is Amazon a 3PL?

Amazon is a complex beast. While it began as, and remains to be, an online marketplace, Amazon now offers FBA services, which stands for âFulfilment by Amazonâ. While 3PL firms such as Zendbox are agnostic in terms of the eCommerce platforms and marketplaces their clients sell on, FBA is purely for the Amazon sales channel. While FBA gives you direct access to Amazonâs Prime subscribers, their fees are usually higher, and they offer minimal order customisation options. Many eCommerce retailers will work with a 3PL, and also Amazon FBA, to maximise sales opportunities, however this means placing stock in more than one geographic location.

The benefits of third-party logistics

Working with a 3PL means you will usually only pay for what you use. Rather than having to invest in building or renting your own warehouse operations, hire and train staff, develop your own systems and processes, along with utilising an outsourced WMS, and barcode scanning technology, a 3PL can take care of these things on your behalf.

An eCommerce fulfilment specialist can also help you scale, and thanks to the collaborative buying power, a 3PL can give you access to âpooled volumeâ discounted shipping rates. A best-in-class fulfilment provider will also take the time to really get to know your business and help you grow, by introducing technology partners that complement the 3PLâs services. For example, a Shopify retailer might require a new website, or be struggling to generate a return on investment from paid channels. While a 3PL wonât be able to directly help with this, they might have a partner agency contact who can.

Inventory analysis tools, such as the above, can be offered by third-party logistics providers, to give retailers full visibility of order processing carried out by the fulfilment centre. This type of technology, such as Zendportal, can help predict when to, or not to order new stock, to minimise understocking and overstocking.

The drawbacks of 3PLs

Working with a 3PL means you will need to give up an element of control. There is usually a bedding-in period, which is why it makes sense to run some test orders before switching fully to a new fulfilment warehouse, to identify potential gaps in service quality. Some 3PLs will work with smaller businesses shipping from 10-30 items per day, whereas others will demand a minimum of 300 daily orders. It might not be cost-effective for a startup business to utilise a 3PL, because they have very little data to predict order volumes. For startups who are experiencing strong and persistent growth, such as going viral on TikTok, a 3PL will usually be more willing to help.

The future of logistics outsourcing

The future of third-party logistics will be determined by economic factors such as land availability, retail decision-makersâ, and consumersâ expectations. Online shoppers will increasingly expect fast and free shipping, speedy returns, and greater visibility of their delivery progress. Consumers will demand personalisation, but not at the cost of sustainability, placing pressure on firms to offer diverse packaging options, whilst minimising wastage. 3PLs will be expected to pivot, and evolve to meet new trends, such as second-hand products, and slow living, in which consumers can also opt for eco-friendly delivery and packaging options, where delivery speed is less important. Ultimately an online retailer must be able to offer their current, and future ideal customers, what they demand, on their terms, profitably, and getting logistics outsourcing right is key to achieving this goal.

Embracing sustainability: Information technology and the ...,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/mcb/024/2010/00000030/00000003/art00002,N/A,"Purpose ‐ Resource-based view proposes that possessing valuable, rare information technology (IT) resources that competitors cannot easily reproduce or replicate provides a competitive advantage, but mere ownership of such resources is no guarantee of competitiveness. There is a need also for a strategy paradigm that embraces the wider concerns of social and environmental sustainability as pressing issues of the twenty-first century. ""Operations-as-marketing"" is a proven value-chain based paradigm that calls for transforming operations from merely focusing on internal efficiency into a potent strategic marketing weapon, precisely targeted toward fulfilling customers' needs. Many leading companies have discovered latent economic benefits from adopting the tenets of corporate sustainability. By first establishing that corporate sustainability translates commercially into customer-centric, lean productivity, the paper examines the potential mediating role of an ""operations-as-marketing"" strategy in framing IT investment decisions.

Findings ‐ Evidence supports the leading contention, thus outlining a customer-centrism approach to enhancing the financial performance of 3PL firms. Research limitations/implications ‐ The research demonstrates a proven decision-making framework for guiding IT investments that can allow proactive nurturing of a competitive advantage. The main drawback is sample size, although established guidelines suggest adequacy and several diagnostics provided reassurance against any major statistical drawbacks. Practical implications ‐ In the face of globalization and other social and environmental issues, the model suggests three key areas of focus for IT investments in proactively enhancing firm performance.

A Causal Model to Find the Relationships Between 3PL ...,https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/a-causal-model-to-find-the-relationships-between-3pl-service-providers-and-the-performance-of-the-logistics-process-in-mexican-manufacturing-companies/239058,N/A,"Abstract

Chapter Preview Top Background As the international exchange backbone, logistics comprises transportation, warehouses, cross-border crossings, and payment systems, among other functions that are commonly performed by private service providers; in order to support private operators and merchandise owners; which are also essential for governments and regional and international organizations (Önsel & Ülengin 2016). Due to the population increment that industrial growth has brought, the 3PL function has become relevant in the logistics sector currently (Baligil et al., 2011). The services and the complexity of the supply chain has had a huge progress as a result of multiple suppliers and customers involved in it, which have recently led to the use of service companies to support the logistics management. In addition, these companies are known as 3PL, which offer different strategies to reduce transportation times and product distribution. Also, several studies mention that supply chains will be effective until logistic companies identify, measure, and control their performance elements when offering those services which development should consider the flow of functions in an interrelated manner, and not only as individual activities (Kayakutlu & Buyukozkan 2011). Internationally, the logistics industry can be considered as the base arteries of economic development, therefore as the logistics outsourcing as a main aspect in business. Nevertheless, in recent years, the integration and promotion of 3PL professional services within the supply chain have increased (Huang et al. 2015). For most of the manufacturing firms, logistics is neither their core competency nor a core business function, but an essential function for them to gain competitive advantage (Bulgurcu & Nakiboglu, 2018).

The purpose of this chapter is to present the relationship between the external service provider named Third Party Logistics 3PL and the performance of the logistics process in Mexican manufacturing companies, in order to ascertain the contribution of the aspects considered, allowing companies' suggested improvement actions. Through a field research in Ciudad Juarez and making use of an instrument about 3PL, authors considered four variables: transport, transport management, information technologies, and warehouse. To find the causal model with the relationships between the variables, authors used structural equations modelling. That also identified the relevant aspects in 3PL providers companies' manufacturing and collaboration activities realized in the practice. The results indicate that mainly the information technologies and the transport management have a greater influence on the performance of the logistics process in this type of company.",3PL sustainability innovations

Maersk – sustainable warehouse technologies | FFSC,https://futuresupplychains.org/maersk-sustainable-warehouse-technologies/,N/A,"In 2021, Maersk set up an inland decarbonisation programme with the aim to serve customers with end-to-end decarbonised logistics solutions. One of the most important parts of this from an emissions and customer perspective is contract logistics (warehouses and depots).

Currently, Maersk has over 280 warehouses across the globe, accounting for 5.6 million m2, and has ambitions to expand to more than 800 warehouses by 2026. Its warehouses use a hybrid-system of automation and robotics.

Maersk warehouses can be split into three main groups: Consolidation centres, deconsolidation centres and fulfilment centres.

Maersk has announced that by 2030, 90% of its contract logistics across its warehouses, depots and cold stores for scopes 1 and 2 will be green.

Reduction of energy consumption and waste

Robotics

BotsAndUs

In 2022, Maersk invested in BotsAndUs, a London-based start-up which collects real-time information using fully autonomous, mobile robots to quickly process pallets at every stage in their journey throughout a warehouse. It is collaborating with Maersk in one of their warehouses, exploring automating inventory management and acceptance processes as well as improving customers’ visibility and access to inventory across facilities.

Boston Dynamics

Maersk is one of the early adopters for Boston Dynamics’ robot, Stretch™, its newest robot is designed specifically for warehouses and distribution centres. It is scheduled for 2022 delivery, after running a pilot test.

Stretch unloads floor-loaded trailers and containers, works with a wide range of package types and sizes, has advanced mobility and a footprint the size of a pallet, so it is built to manoeuvre in and out of trucks and tight spaces in a warehouse. It automatically recovers cases and doesn’t need human interaction at any point. It can unload trailers at up to 800 cases per hour. Its battery allows 16 hours of operation or more on one charge.

Warehouse Management Systems

In 2021 Maersk announced a partnership with US-based software giant, JDA Software, as part of its digital transformation strategy. It uses JDA’s warehouse management system to provides visibility throughout the Maersk supply chain, improve warehousing processes and efficiency while lowering inventory costs and environmental impact. It also helps customers balance on-time delivery with the need for cost-effective distribution.

Automation and slotting

IAI Labs Technology

In November 2021 in Redlands, California, Maersk’s cross-functional innovation team started to collaborate with IAI Labs Technology to create a customized digital application for the slotting solution process in omni-channel fulfilment centres. The new AI empowered technology being prototyped enhances the storage location and distribution of items in the warehouse, saving space, boosting productivity and increasing efficiency.

HUUB

In 2021 Maersk acquired HUUB, a Portuguese cloud-based logistics start-up, specializing in technology solutions for B2C warehousing for the fashion industry.

The HUUB platform manages inventory, fulfilment and delivery. At the same time, it connects with warehouses, carriers, online stores, and ERP systems in a plug & play solution.

It gives full control over inventory management – customers can see how much stock is available and control the inventory, matching supply with demand and preventing overstocking and unsustainable practices.

Eco warehouses and green electricity

Maersk is focusing on:

Energy efficiency optimised buildings and operations

Renewable energy installation.

From 2022 onwards, new sites will be designed as low carbon, targeting LEED ‘Platinum’, BREEAM ‘Excellent’ or equivalent accreditation. Maersk is also launching a global retrofitting programme of its existing footprint together with its vendors and partners.

Pharmaceutical warehouse, Mszczonów, Poland

Maersk launched a project in late 2020 to create a second pharmaceutical warehouse as part of its existing warehousing and distribution centre in Mszczonów near Warsaw, Poland.

It offers carbon neutral and environmentally friendly solutions and it’s the first one in Poland with BREEAM Excellent certificate. It has photovoltaic panels installed on the roof, as well as a chilled water system used to supply power to the coolers of all air handling units and fan coils. In addition, the heat recovery installation supplies the buffer tank located in the gas boiler room and the recycled heat will be used to supply heaters in air handling units during the summer. The facility will have an integrated Quality Management System, based on Good Distribution and Manufacturing Practice (GDP) and ISO certificates.",3PL sustainability innovations
3PL Warehouse Management Challenges,https://www.canary7.com/3pl-warehouse-management-challenges/,N/A,"Poor end-to-end visibility

Lack of visibility is one of the most common, recurring warehouse challenges that you may have to deal with as a 3PL business. Essentially, lack of visibility means that you are out of touch with your warehouse activity – you don’t know what’s going on within your warehouse/fulfilment centre, and hence are unaware of any problems that may cause the fulfilment process to bottleneck. It also means that you are not in control of your processes, which is likely to make it even harder for you to make the changes needed to ensure efficiency within the warehouse. All of this can cause the number of 3PL warehouse management challenges you need to deal with to increase.

Last-mile logistics problems

Last-mile logistics problem is another one of 3PL warehouse management challenges that can give warehouse managers and 3PL business-owners a tough time. “Last mile” refers to the final step of the fulfilment operation, i.e. the delivery. In simple words, the last-mile logistics problem is that shipping is expensive, and yet, customers expect free delivery. A good old paradox that it is, it is enough to cause 3PLs to worry about their operations as a whole. There are many aspects that feed into the last-mile logistics problem, such as failed deliveries, poor tracking, lack of transparency, unpredictable transit complications, and lack of a proper, holistic delivery infrastructure.

The Covid-19 pandemic made it even harder for businesses to manage the last-mile problem. This is because it came with the need for urgency – people wanted their Covid-19 lockdown supplies, and they needed them fast. What this resulted in was a pressure to speed up existing shipment procedures, and ensure that each aspect of last-mile logistics was seamless and aligned with the needs of the customer. This pressure has existed way beyond the lockdowns and Covid-19 chaos, and has left 3PLs grappling to adjust to the “new normal.” With most warehouses still relying on outdated delivery tools and technologies, the 3PL industry, for the most part, is still behind in the race in terms of ensuring the last-mile logistics are at par with needs of the modern post-covid customer.

Lack of scalability

No matter what the current size of your business is, all 3PL businesses want to grow. Unfortunately, scalability forms one of the most common 3PL warehouse management challenges, and therefore deserves your full attention. Scalability is impossible to achieve without a logistical framework, and a logistical framework, in today’s world, is entirely dependent on cutting-edge 3PL software solutions. If 3PL businesses keep using paper-based systems, scalability will remain one of the most difficult 3PL warehouse management challenges. This is because for scalability and growth, you need to prove to your existing customers that you are cut out for the race. This will involve a display of efficiency and productivity, which cannot be done with paper-based systems.

Scalability is increasingly becoming a problem as the world grows more interconnected. Because it is possible for end users to place their orders from all over the world, it means that businesses have to make it possible for themselves to ship all over the world as well. Third party logistics are complicated as it is, and with this element of globalisation added to the picture, 3PLs can really get a run for their money if they are planning to grow their business and get more customers on board. This, needless to say, is easier said than done and will require a lot of effort from a 3PL’s end.

High expectations

In general, customers of the 21st century display considerably more sophisticated in terms of their consumer behaviour, and hence have higher expectations that you must successfully tackle if you are planning to work towards long-lasting success as a 3PL. Some things that customers expect from businesses in 2022 include but are not limited to are: seamless cross-channel shopping, great environmental and social consciousness, technology-driven shopping experiences, fast and free shipping, and of course: flexible payments. Keep in mind that this is a exhaustive list – actually the extent of customer demands in 2022 is non-exhaustive and is likely to place even more requirements and responsibilities on business.

Speed is one of the greatest demands of the customer and bringing speed to the centre of your processes proves to be one of the most worrying 3PL warehouse management challenges. Customers today expect their order to be in their hands within 24 hours, and even though it is not possible, they want you to make it possible. Hence, the stakes are quite high in this area which can cause 3PLs some very major concerns. Any errors, defects, or mistakes can manifest into major setbacks, causing great delays and even greater dissatisfaction. This makes it crushingly difficult to satisfy the needs of the customer. However, if you are planning to stay in business for good then you must figure out a way to do it.

Workforce management

It is true that your workforce is your most important asset and with the right people on board, your 3PL experience can easily be improved in the best possible way. However, the main problem is that dealing with employees is not a piece of cake for any business, let alone a 3PL business that has to simultaneously tackle hundreds of 3PL challenges on a daily basis. Whether you have a big team or a small one, ensuring that task delegation is aligned with the overall goals and KPIs you have in place for the success of your business can prove to be tricky.

What’s more is that at times, it can be very hard to keep the morale of your employees high enough for them to actively participate in the warehouse activity taking place within a 3PL framework. Needless to say, working in a 3PL warehouse is not always easy and when having to deal with one problem after another, it is very likely that your employees may feel like they are not cut out for the job. Low employee morale will slow down processes and cause delays that 3PLs can simply not control. In essence, your employees empower the rest of your processes as well, so you can simply not afford for them to be disengaged from their jobs!",3PL sustainability innovations
Key Trends Shaping the 3PL Industry in Upcoming Years,https://thebusinessfame.in/key-trends-shaping-the-3pl-industry-in-upcoming-years/,N/A,"The logistics sector is undergoing a profound transformation, spurred by evolving consumer behaviors, technological advancements, and a surge in delivery vehicle traffic. In response, third-party logistics (3PL) providers are swiftly adapting to a new reality where traditional practices are no longer sufficient. As the global 3PL industry hurtles toward a predicted valuation exceeding $1.3 trillion by 2026, three pivotal factors are steering the course for modern 3PL providers in 2023.

Changing Consumer Expectations

The seismic shift caused by Amazon’s introduction of one-day shipping in 2019 has reverberated across the retail and logistics landscapes. The era of “instant gratification” has reshaped consumer expectations, making fast and free deliveries the new norm. In the United States, the speed of delivery and shipping cost considerations now influence nine out of 10 purchasing decisions.

However, the convenience of quick-ship practices has come at an environmental cost, with increased vehicle traffic, carbon emissions, and packaging waste. Consumers are now more conscious of the long-term impacts of their choices, leading to a significant uptick in sustainability awareness. Over 60% of consumers have altered their consumption habits to embrace more sustainable practices, and a staggering 88% express loyalty to brands prioritizing sustainability.

As the industry moves forward, 3PLs must champion sustainability initiatives. Electric delivery fleets, carbon offsets, and recycled packaging are just the beginning. By collaborating with brands and aligning end-to-end logistics services with sustainability goals, 3PLs can play a pivotal role in creating a greener future for the shipping industry.

Building Supply Chain Resiliency

The globalization of supply chains over the past three decades has exposed companies to a myriad of risks, from extreme weather events to labor disputes and supplier disruptions. Recent events, including the pandemic and climate change impacts, have underscored the need for supply chain resiliency and diversification.

To fortify supply chains, companies are leveraging data-informed predictions and real-time demand analysis. These tools offer visibility into factors ranging from weather patterns to seasonal shopping shifts, enabling swift responses to changing conditions. Additionally, surge-ready stockpiles, order orchestration, and end-to-end logistics control with 3PL partners are becoming essential components of resilient supply chains.

In response to excess inventory challenges, brands are turning to order orchestration and distributed logistics networks. While optimizing fulfillment time through multiple warehouses incurs initial costs, collaborating with a 3PL allows brands to efficiently manage their order fulfillment process from placement to delivery, including returns.

Utilizing Modern Technologies

Embracing advanced technologies is a common theme across industries seeking to boost productivity. The 3PL sector is no exception, incorporating artificial intelligence, machine learning, technology platforms, and robotics to enhance operational efficiency.

Persistent supply chain challenges and labor constraints have prompted 3PLs to adopt automation and robotics technologies. From data-driven order processing to warehouse and transportation technologies, these advancements improve communication and increase visibility for logistics providers, brands, and consumers.

Robotic technologies are revolutionizing warehouse and fulfillment operations, automating manual tasks such as picking, sorting, and packaging. The rise of Robots as a Service (RaaS) allows 3PLs to benefit from improved safety and enhanced fulfillment speeds without the prohibitive costs of ownership. Moreover, the use of exoskeletal suits in warehousing is enhancing worker well-being, reducing fatigue, strain, and physical risks.

The 3PL industry in 2023 is navigating a landscape defined by changing consumer expectations, a focus on supply chain resiliency, and the widespread adoption of modern technologies. Success in this dynamic environment requires 3PL providers to not only adapt but also lead the way in shaping a more sustainable, resilient, and technologically advanced future for logistics.",3PL sustainability innovations

Top Upcoming Cold Chain Trends,https://xpdel.com/blog/top-upcoming-cold-chain-trends/,N/A,"Explore the future of cold chain logistics and discover the top trends shaping the industry. Delve into sustainable cold storage solutions and learn more about the transformative landscape of temperature-controlled logistics. Stay informed, stay ahead!

A cold chain product in the logistics industry is where the product needs to be maintained at a cold temperature. The specified temperature needs to be maintained from the collection to the delivery. In the third-party logistics industry, the company should have the equipment and the facilities to maintain this temperature during the various stages of product transfer. Cold chain logistics is usually more complicated than regular logistics. This is because they deal with perishable products that must be delivered within a specific timeframe. Although this field is quite complex, it withstands the test of time as there is always a requirement to ship cold, perishable, and temperature-sensitive goods.

What are the Top Trends in Cold Chain Logistics?

The face of cold chain logistics has changed significantly in recent years. Customer expectations and changes in business trends have molded the shape of the cold chain logistics industry to its current form. Let us discuss a few trends that can shape the future of cold chain logistics.

• Demand for a Better Level of Service

The cold chain logistics industry is set to grow further in the future. With the growth comes new expectations. One of the major expectations is better service. More and more companies are working closely with third-party logistics (3PL) companies to meet their requirements. The companies have shipping and logistics requirements as per usual. However, they are also looking at the 3PL providers for new and innovative solutions and ideas to make the process more seamless. The companies expect the 3PL providers to have plans for issues such as labor shortages and natural disasters. They want a provider with a solid business continuity plan. So the level of service these companies expect nowadays is higher than ever.

• Expectations of a Flexible 3PL

Along with the expectation of better service, companies are looking for a 3PL provider who can be flexible according to the market demands. The companies want the 3PL provider to be able to adapt to any changes. They want the service providers to be able to have an adjustable plan of shipment. Furthermore, they also want visibility of the entire process. The companies expect transparency in the entire transaction. They want to track all the stages of the product shipment, and since this is cold chain logistics, they also want an update on the temperature maintained.

• Better Usage of Warehouse

Warehouse plays an important role in cold chain logistics. Managing the warehouse space effectively and maintaining a dry environment is key for cold chain products. Companies are expecting their 3PL providers to have more products available with them, stored at their warehouses. Suppose there is an unforeseen disruption in product delivery. In that case, they can still deliver the excess products ready at their warehouses. The challenge here is to build a warehouse equipped with the equipment required to house cold chain products.

• Combat Labor Shortage

In the past, there has been a lack of drivers to transport goods across the entire 3PL industry. However, in the future, the 3PL industry, including the cold chain sector, will see a severe lack of labor in general. The solution is to implement and integrate robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) into their process to combat this labor shortage. While a considerable investment is involved in implementing and maintaining these technologies, the cost of searching and the ever-increasing wages of skilled laborers might also be a hurdle. Therefore, the companies are looking for 3PL providers who can demonstrate that they have effectively combat these labor shortages.

• Better Differentiator Than Cost

All the existing 3PL companies in the market offer their services at a competitive rate. So, the cost of the service is not an adequate differentiator anymore. Currently, the differentiator is the quality of service you provide and the value-added services you give the customer. Suppose you have a well-run warehouse space and a smooth distribution service. In that case, it will give you a distinctive edge over your competitors. This is especially true in the current scenario where proper storage in the warehouse facility is a big obstacle worldwide.

• Include Digitalization

One of the technologies that will continue to grow in cold chain logistics is digital freight matching. In this technology, the system matches an available space with a carrier. Additionally, the technology also calculates the price and offers an instantaneous quotation. This technology reduces the errors in matching available spots with the carriers and uses the services more effectively. In the future of logistics, 3PL providers will need to incorporate more digitalization and technologies such as AI in their processes. Incorporating these technologies effectively will ensure the process is smooth, error-free, and quick.

• Embrace Sustainability

One of the key trends in cold chain logistics will be sustainability. The 3PL provider will have to conduct every aspect of their business sustainably. They will have to take active measures to reduce emissions, lower their carbon footprint, and be more eco-friendly. Controlling the temperature and lighting through sensors and other such efforts will be a key player. Another serious effort will be to use electric vehicles and control the HVAC system to be more effective.

• Better Solutions for Cold Storage

One of the biggest demands in cold chain logistics will be better and new storage methods for these products. The packaging and the storing of these products will be of utmost importance. 3PL providers will have to be innovative with their solutions. Suppose they don’t have a warehouse specifically for cold storage. In that case, the providers will have to develop ideas such as floating warehouses to combat these problems. The packaging also needs to be effective because if the products are spoiled during delivery, the provider will have to bear the damages and insurance costs.

Conclusion:

As per a recent Precedence Research report, the cold chain logistics market had a value of $304.8 billion in 2022. It is predicted to increase to $892.6 billion by 2030. This growth will depend heavily on the success of the grocery and pharmaceutical industries. In conclusion, the cold chain logistics market will see an exponential inclusion of digitalization, improved sustainability, and better automation. If you plan to tap into this industry, be ready to embrace these changes.

Visual Guide to 3PL Logistics – What is 3PL?,https://www.crownsds.com/what-is-3pl/,N/A,"What is 3PL?

Scaling up your e-commerce business can become problematic when it comes to online order fulfilment. As your business grows, you may find that fulfilling customer orders in-house is no longer a feasible option. Managing an e-commerce business, your expertise probably falls within many areas that sit outside of logistics. Sourcing a third-party logistics provider could be a key piece of the puzzle – enabling you to continue to deliver inventory to your customers with a seamlessly integrated logistics solution.

What is a third-party logistics provider?

Third-party logistics (3PL) enables a business to outsource its fulfilment and logistics to a specialist third-party provider, including everything from picking and packing, warehousing, inventory management, transportation and order fulfilment.

The use of a 3PL provider supports a simple and seamless service, that ensures items are automatically shipped to your customer when they purchase online, via a neatly integrated IT system. Taking away the requirement for in-house distribution, your 3PL provider will take care of your warehousing, inventory management and distribution.

Could your existing infrastructure handle a surge in demand?

You might be right in thinking your business infrastructure is already sufficiently equipped to deal with current levels of demand, but with growth in mind, it’s sensible to consider outsourcing logistics to a 3PL provider before your business is overwhelmed by orders. Failing to fulfil customer orders, due to supply chain problems, can lead to lost sales and long-term reputation damage. In fact, one study found that if an item is not delivered within two days of the date promised, ‘69% of consumers are much less or less likely to shop with a retailer in the future’.

The last quarter of the year is the busiest and most profitable period for retailers, as we see shoppers make Halloween, Black Friday and Christmas purchases, with another peak around Easter. But if your business is unprepared for a surge in demand, it could lead to longer lead times or even a failure to fulfil orders.

Entrusting your logistics to a reliable 3PL provider, could be the answer to meeting fluctuating demand throughout the year and staying ahead of the curve with a streamlined order fulfilment and distribution operation.

Benefits of using a 3PL provider – Outsourcing Logistics

React to market fluctuations

Scale up and down your operation as and when needed, enabling your business to meet fluctuations in demand, without significant capital commitment towards own fleet and warehousing.

Enhanced customer experience

Plugging into an integrated logistics service will provide your customers with faster delivery, nationwide coverage, real-time tracking and live communications; among many other benefits that come from having access to an outsourced 3PL distribution network.

Access to Expertise

Let the challenges of warehousing and distribution fall to an expert in the field of logistics, allowing you to focus on the areas that can maximize the potential of your business.

Create Cost-Savings

Outsourcing elements of your supply chain, you’ll benefit from not having to invest in and maintain a warehousing facility, fleet of vehicles and the staff that would be required to operate them.

Choosing a 3PL provider

Type of provider:

Choosing a third-party logistics provider is entirely down to the individual requirements of your business. For a fully end-to-end logistics solution, you’ll be looking for a full-service provider that can manage your inventory from start to finish, through its nationwide fulfilment centers. There are also transportation-based 3PLs that can move your goods between different locations – including from a factory or supplier, to warehouse and even onward to retail stores or direct to customer homes.

Crown SDS offers a wide range of transportation and warehousing services, seamlessly supporting international 3PL providers with logistics solutions. And in conjunction with major International 3PL providers, Crown SDS provides bespoke solutions for many businesses.

We support a nationwide homeware retailer with a bespoke warehousing, consolidation and delivery service:

Using its nationwide fleet of vehicles, Crown were able to optimise collections by using vans, to replace the work previously undertaken by larger vehicles that had been running well below capacity.

Upon arrival into Crown’s central warehousing facility, inventory received is logged into Crown’s Warehouse Management System (WMS) and consolidated into larger volumes by palletising goods. These larger consignments are prepared and booked in for shipping to retailers using heavy haulage vehicles, all managed in-house by a dedicated team.

Other considerations when choosing a 3PL Provider:

Tech Integration – can your 3PL integrate it’s operation with your own? Whilst you’ll be instructing a 3PL provider to manage your operation, you’ll want to ensure you have seamless logistics technology integration to retain full visibility of your inventory. Room for Growth – Can your 3PL sustain order fulfilment as your business grows? Be sure to choose a provider that can support the longer-term goals of your business. Location – Does the location of your 3PL provider meet the needs of your business? Consider whether their areas of coverage and size of facility can meet your distribution needs.

Service Innovation in Third Party Logistics - hig .diva,http://hig.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:515980,N/A,"Service Innovation in Third Party Logistics: A case Study of Green Cargo Logistics AB

2012 (English)

Student thesis

For a very long time, Innovation has been viewed as technological phenomenon representing technological advancement in product or process features. A lot of research can be found in literature representing product innovation management supported by empirical studies, however, prospect of service innovation management has been largely ignored. Especially there is very limited research on service development process in third party logistics companies.

This research aims to bring a holistic view of innovation management in third party logistics (3PL) companies so that a better understanding can be developed and it can be examined if existing innovation models are valid for 3PL companies.

To achieve the objectives of this thesis, relevant literature has been reviewed extensively so that conductors of this research can get benefit of existing knowledge in the field and a duplication of research can be avoided. This research work is based on qualitative case study and Green Cargo Logistics AB (which is one of well established third part logistics (3PL) companies) was selected in order to find answers to research questions, which were resulted from the research gaps, found in existing literature. Findings from the case company are discussed in connection with theory and an analysis is made to reach on following conclusion.

Conclusions: An innovative 3PL company has better ability to stay competitive and increase its market share through a better ability to serve it with new better services. Along with technological advancement, spotted opportunity for business growth, threat from competition and customer demand, environmental concerns have also been recognized as driving force for innovations in 3PL. This thesis also shows that a small independent unit (group of people) can play role of innovative organization to prosper creativity by improving interactions with external and internal linkages. This research illustrates that contrary to existing literature (which says there should be one single strategy for innovation management process), a flexible and adaptive strategy can be equally or more effective. For balancing risks and rewards while selecting development projects, consideration of return on investment (ROI) is found to be the most important decision criterion. For implementing the selected innovative idea, a small-scale test should be conducted in order to avoid risks associated with development projects.",3PL sustainability innovations
Key Performance Expectations for 3PL Service Providers,https://publication.sipmm.edu.sg/key-performance-expectations-3pl-service-providers/,N/A,"A third-party logistics provider offer various outsourcing services such as warehousing, transportation, procurement, value-added services and to certain execution scope. Technology integration is also a ‘must have’ to enhance the entire service level. Outsourcing business model meeting customer’s expectation through cost –efficiency, increase productivity, flexibility, scalability, and economies of scale, meeting delivery dateline and technologies. The pictograph below shows using technologies with combination of machine learning across supply chain operations. Efficiently in optimizing the inventory turn and increase operations efficiency and achieve responsiveness to customers.

Expectation on Outsourcing Benefits

A 3PL with integrated services increase their flexibility to adjust to customer’s expectation and to be cost effective. Key benefits are as follows:

• End-to-End Visibility increase connectivity throughout the entire flow with IT centralising operational data. It can helps in achieving significant increase in cross-operational visibility such as inventory health, delivery status, order status and etc.

• Flexibility helps to smooth out the day-to-day operations functions and react to unforeseen disruption. 3PL has the capability to leverage on their expertise and resources for any changes.

• Reduced Waste is another benefit on working together to cut down the effort and redundant processes such as a consoled shipment in FTL instead of 2 LTL from two different department to a same designation.

• Data Centralization improve the workflows by advanced analyse. It also helps in increasing the overall efficiency of the value chain.

• Improved Margins through increase of efficiency, reduce wastage, improved performance with satisfied customers.

Expectation on Warehouse Operations

Customers have high expectation on 3PL’s fulfilling their day-to-day operations by meeting measurable Key Performance covering important area as such receiving, organization, fulfilment, distribution, reverse logistics, value added services, cross dock, optimising storage and etc. Assisting customer on identifying key areas can make improvement, better productivities, reduce operations cost and delivery on time.

These key areas include the following:

• Receiving Efficiency can involve in accuracy, multiple new stock receive each week, customer return of good and defective unit and stock return. Tracked and measured by paying attention on the time taken receive till cargo put away.

• Picking Accuracy in a warehouse can consider a complex activities. Picking wrong parts or quantity can cause a significant impact on return items and huge costs. Creating appropriate warehousing racking and shelving will improve picker’s efficiency, productivity and reduce hassle. Picking accuracy can measure from “rate of return” KPI and “total order number”.

• Carrying Cost of Inventory tracking can help customer see the profit current stock will truly bring. It’s can also furnish a more accurate demand forecast and put in place a more suitable inventory control methods. Carrying cost of inventory consists adding the insurance, taxes, storage space, personnel equipment; all costs associated with storing inventory.

• Inventory Turnover ties closely with carrying cost of inventory. Providing this key performance data helps Customer has the visibility on how quickly their inventory sell and ship stock from the day inventory storage in warehouse. The fastest turnaround has less storage cost which customer make more profit. This can also help customer to gauge future buying practices and put in place inventory reduction strategies. 3PL’s Warehouse Management System (WMS) place an important roles to generate relevant reports.

• Rate of Return measure the end customer’s satisfaction. 3PL has assist customer on compile the reason of return and propose the strategies to resolve. It’s easier to rectify internal warehouse related issue such as wrong or damage cargo delivered.

• Backorder Rate allows in-depth deep analysis of forecasting success. Its measure the shortage of require stock and unexpected stock surge. Continually high stock out reflect the poor planning and forecasting. Constantly measure the inventory turnover will assist customer on improving their forecast ability.

• Order Lead Time is basically the average length of time the cargo takes from order release to warehouse till end customers to receive it. The lower the turnaround time (TAT) the better you have achieve on delivery KPI.

Performance Expectation on Partner Management

As a 3PL, sourcing of partners or managing on behalf are part of the Key performance expectation. Delivery is one of the activities require more focus due to the network complexity and pricing model (many hidden cost). 3PL can directly provide the services or engage or manage customer’s appointed provider. Shipping consist of local delivery, import and export.

Order visibility require connectivity between 3PL and shipper e.g Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), Electronic Air Waybill (e-AWB) and Application Programming Interface (API). Customer is expecting 3PL to provide full responsibility to control the entire shipping process. Automation through Transportation Management system (TMS) or Integrated Freight Management system can assist visibility on shipment REAL status e.g. Last Mile Delivery. Collecting and analysing freight data can help to avoid unnecessary cost, improve the TAT and end customer satisfaction.

Performance Expectation on Procurement Management

The benefit on Outsourcing procurement can bring down the overall procurement spend. Customer is expecting to see a lower cost from direct and indirect, maximizing the resources, augmented freight, better TAT performance, streamline and seamlessly integrate processes. Ultimately 3PL can help customer achieving their goal by freeing their time to focus on their own core competencies, reduce purchase cost and improve their relationship with their end customer. Procurement Analytics created a visualization dashboard through analysing the past, why, future and decision making.

Procurement 10 most important metrics and KPIs measure through Spend under Management, Spend vs budget, Total cost of ownership, Cost Savings, Cost avoidance, Average payment terms, Number of suppliers, Contract coverage, Exchange rate exposure and Vendor accountability.

Top 3PL Trends That will Reshape Logistics in 2023,https://www.logisticlink.net/blog/top-3pl-trends-2023/,N/A,"The use of third-party logistics (3PL) providers is a rapidly growing trend in the logistics and supply chain industry as more and more businesses look to outsource their logistics operations to experts in the field. As we move into 2023, several key trends are expected to shape the 3PL industry and significantly impact how businesses approach logistics and supply chain management.



From the increasing use of technology and automation to the growing importance of sustainability and social responsibility, we’ll explore how 3PL providers adapt to meet their customers’ changing needs. In this blog we covered the top seven 3PL trends that will reshape 3PL platforms in 2023.



Top trends in 2023 that will reshape the 3PL platform

Over the past two decades, the third-party logistics sector has undergone a significant transformation. This transition will continue to affect how third-party logistics providers operate their businesses in the future. Here are some 3PL trends that will shape 2023.

Stronger emphasis on sustainability

The logistics sector will emphasize sustainability in the upcoming years as customers become more environmentally conscious.

This might include the usage of hybrid or electric cars and the transition to greener packaging materials.

Additionally, third-party logistics providers can collaborate with their customers to reduce their carbon footprints and make a difference.

The business can achieve this with the help of sustainable packaging, greater fill rate per transport unit to ship more goods per fuel tank, and electric vehicles.

Increased adoption of technology

In 2023, businesses can expect greater technology adoption in the third-party logistics sector. This involves using

big data analytics, and artificial intelligence to increase efficiency and streamline processes and automation.

To boost efficiency and profits, third-party logistics providers are also expanding their investments in smarter IT and software solutions like cloud computing, blockchain, and inventory management systems. These technological developments allow the 3PL platform to save costs, simplify their deliveries, and increase operational productivity.

Hands-off reporting

In 2023, 3PL’s focus will be more than just efficient operations. To save more time to concentrate on other aspects of the businesses, 3PLs will be looking for ways to reduce time across all areas of the operations, mainly through the automation of manual procedures like invoicing, ordering, and rate calculations.

Automating reports, orders, and invoicing will save 3PLs time and allow them to concentrate on other aspects of their business. From barcode scanning for cross-docking — data capture to sign-on glass at warehouse dispatch will be crucial, thorough, and streamlined.

Track–ability

As order tracking with home and food delivering rises, expectations for tracking at all levels of the supply chain will increase. Whether it’s the ability to see stock levels in the warehouse, stock movement reports, or a shipment in transit, trackability offers crucial usable data to all the supply chain staff members.

The expectation of tracking where a shipment or order is at any level in the supply chain will make more and more 3PLs integrate trackability, along with the ability to share this with customers and partners for their reporting and planning requirements.

Last mile delivery

Last-mile delivery has been a significant factor in the logistics industry over the years and is still one of the major trends in the industry. It has become a significant component of eCommerce because it impacts the final result of the customer experience.

Using experienced labour, trained employees, and technological innovations, TMS software can significantly enhance the delivery process and streamline workflow ultimately leading to a faster delivery operation. A great last-mile experience retains and engages customers and encourages them to purchase more if they are satisfied with the delivery services.

Direct software integrations

Connection is crucial. In 2023, the ability to securely share data and connect systems seamlessly as part of daily operations will be a main focus for 3PLs looking to expand and optimize operations.

Enabling seamless data transfer between systems for accuracy and easier communication across processes, between partners, customers software, warehouse, and transport operation will offer 3PLs a new level of consumer service and operational efficiency.

Omnichannel service

An ideal omnichannel third-party logistics partner can be the best way for businesses to fulfill orders. Omnichannel fulfillment enables businesses to fill orders from any channel by managing the entire inventory and simplifying the packing, selecting, and shipping process

In addition to real-time inventory monitoring and order management systems, 3PLs have the procedures and technology necessary to handle omnichannel shipping. By collaborating with third-party logistics suppliers, organizations can implement Omni Channel without investing much money in infrastructure.

Final thoughts

As the logistics industry evolves, it creates new business opportunities for 3PLs that provide warehousing and transportation services. New technologies are giving these companies additional opportunities to grow and optimize. So, whether you’re a business looking for a reliable logistics professional or logistics partner to stay ahead of the curve, stay updated with the latest trends in 3PL, and discover how they can benefit your business.",3PL sustainability innovations
3PL (Third Party Logistic). What it is and advantages,https://acrosslogistics.com/blog/en/3pl-third-party-logistic,N/A,"The tasks of warehousing and distribution of products and goods can be very complex for some companies to manage. Delivering maximum efficiency in these two functional areas of a company’s processes is critical to improving performance and results.

As we have already mentioned, in situations where logistics management is not correct, you can always count on 3PL services, an interesting and professional solution that can add the competitive advantage you need to raise your performance to a new level.

Let’s take a closer look at what 3PLs in logistics are and their important role for today’s companies.

What does 3PL mean

3PL stands for Third Party Logistics, which refers to the concept of third-party logistics or outsourced logistics.

A 3PL provider offers outsourced logistics services, covering everything involved in managing one or more facets of warehousing and distribution activities.

The Challenge of Sustainability in the Field of Logistics,https://www.nordlogway.com/eng/news/the-challenge-of-sustainability-in-the-field-of-logistics,N/A,"Figures from the European Environment Agency show that 25% of the CO 2 emissions in Spain come from logistical and transport operations. The data reveals that in Spain the emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere have risen by 50% since 1990, in contrast to other countries like Sweden, which have managed to reduce their emissions. Considering that logistics is one of the most polluting sectors, the challenge for businesses in this sector is to maintain or increase the level of service efficacy and efficiency while at the same time reducing the levels of pollutant gas emissions.

Sustainable logistics is feasible if the sector follows the directives outlined below. Operators can use software applications that provide data on routes, loads and the carbon footprint. Users of these programs can find the optimal loads and routes that allow them to be as sustainable as possible without sacrificing efficiency of service.

The second directive is the Learn & Green initiative promoted by the AECOC, which consists of reducing the everyday waste emissions generated by companies by 20% within 5 years. Intermodality is a proposal which takes into account the combination of different modes of transport and the urgency of the transport of goods. It prioritises the least polluting means of transport to the detriment of the most contaminating ones. Opting for renewable energies, especially the use of solar power through the implementation of photovoltaic installations, allows companies to reduce their electricity consumption.

Another directive is green logistics, a philosophy that promotes the transformation of logistical systems, processes and structures to create new ones that are as environmentally friendly as possible. Green logistics focuses on the efficacious use of resources in order to minimise the environmental impact. It seeks a balance between environmental efficiency and financial costs.

These directives imply a change of attitude within the sector, as they mean that business decisions are not only based on criteria of efficacy and financial costs, but also with a third element in the equation: that of the environmental impact.",3PL sustainability innovations

Sustainability in Warehousing Unleashed with Delivered,https://www.thenewwarehouse.com/2023/07/31/406-unleashing-sustainability-in-warehousing-with-delivered/,N/A,"In this episode of the New Warehouse Podcast, Kevin Mireles, the former Chief Sustainability Officer at Delivered, sheds light on the warehousing industry’s path toward sustainability. Delivered is a national parcel transportation carrier that aims to revolutionize the industry by leveraging excess capacity and orchestrating seamless shipping experiences. Delivered takes sustainability seriously as a pioneer in their field, considering it an essential part of their business model.

Right-Sized Packaging: Maximizing Efficiency and Minimizing Waste

Mireles emphasizes, “Sustainability is all about how we help businesses be more efficient and deliver a better customer experience.” Right-sized packaging, for instance, is a fundamental way to enhance sustainability in logistics. Businesses can simultaneously reduce costs and environmental impact by focusing on efficiently designed packaging and optimizing transportation routes. He notes, “It’s the same model you use to figure out your pricing for transportation, is the same model you use to figure out how to be more sustainable.”

Strategic Inventory Placement: Reducing Emissions and Boosting Customer Experience

Choosing the right locations for distribution centers can significantly impact a company’s environmental footprint. Businesses can avoid express shipping methods and reduce emissions by centralizing or placing inventory closer to customers. Mireles suggests that companies should integrate sustainability metrics into their supply chain tools to evaluate the impact of their decisions thoroughly. Mireles encourages businesses to “Think about the tools you already have. Are they integrated with sustainability metrics to help you make better decisions?” This proactive approach enables them to make well-informed choices that align with their environmental goals, promoting a more sustainable business model. “It requires getting executive-level buy-in, working across silos, and pulling data. There’s no magic bullet, but the same thoughtfulness and approach to improving operations apply.”

Towards a Greener Future: Advancing Sustainability in Warehousing with Technology

Technology continues to revolutionize the warehousing sector. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) and IoT (Internet of Things) devices enable warehouse managers to monitor inventory levels seamlessly. With real-time data, businesses can avoid overstocking, leading to less waste. Integrating automation and robotics enhances the speed and accuracy of warehouse operations while reducing the overall environmental impact. Moreover, implementing AI (Artificial Intelligence) optimizes supply chain routes, reduces fuel consumption, and lowers greenhouse gas emissions. These sustainable technologies are both environmentally friendly and cost-effective, which is a significant incentive for warehouse owners.

Key Takeaways for a More Sustainable Future

Efficient Packaging: Implement right-sized packaging solutions to reduce waste, emissions, and overall costs.

Strategic Inventory Placement: Optimize the locations of distribution centers to reduce the need for express shipping and lower emissions.

Intermodal Transportation: Explore opportunities to shift from trucks to trains, substantially cutting emissions in specific routes.

Abstract: Third-party logistics (3PL) service providers can play a major role in the agriculture supply chain management (ASCM) for customer's satisfaction and cost reduction in managing supply chain. Selection of the suppliers is one of the important factors that need to be considered. Since, by deciding best 3PL supplier, competitiveness and sustainability of supply chain has been increased. However, this decision become complicated when there is multiple 3PL suppliers having multiple criterion and inaccurate parameters. Moreover, the ambiguity and doubtfulness of expert's opinions enhance the problem. Therefore, a decision making tool based on multi criteria has been used widely as fuzzy-analytic hierarchical process (AHP) approach can be used for selection of best 3PL service providers. The main aim of this research is to develop an outline of different criterion for supplier's selection based on literature review and techniques used for selection of the best 3PL suppliers. Furthermore, this research paper provides a more precise, effective and efficient decision support tool for selecting best 3PL providers. This research may help in increasing the tendency for towards the logistics activities outsourcing to enhance sustainability of IoT-based agriculture supply chain.

Sustainable Practices plus Verification Form Cornerstone of SLI Supply Chain Sustainability Program

SSCF Director Richard Bank Provides Update on 3PL Industry Sustainability Program at NITL Annual Convention in Atlanta.

November 15, 2011 â Atlanta, GA â Supply chain sustainability practices â together with neutral third party verification â are the key components of the Sustainable Logistics Initiative (SLI), a ground-breaking self-assessment program launched earlier this year by the International Warehouse and Logistics Association (IWLA). Bank, co-director of the Sustainable Supply Chain Foundation (SSCF), together with Jay Strother, director of membership, marketing and business development for the IWLA, discussed the program in a presentation at the National Industrial Transportation Leagueâs (NITL) 104th Annual Meeting & TransComp Exhibition (click here for the full presentation). The SSCF is the neutral, third party verifying partner for the SLI.

The SLI, designed by the IWLA specifically for its members, is a web-based tool companies can use to easily assess and quantify the sustainability of individual warehouse/logistics facilities. SLI enables companies to establish a sustainability baseline for each facility enrolled in six key areas: electrical usage, recycling, liquid fuel usage, water consumption, employee safety and community service. The SLI program enables companies to track and verify their individual facility progress toward improved sustainability in each of these six areas.

""Using the SLI self assessment, IWLA member third party logistics facilities and companies will be able to demonstrate their sustainability practices to existing and potential customers and to the market in general,"" Bank noted. ""Our foundation will independently and neutrally verify SLI assessment results.""

""This independent, neutral verification is a key differentiator for SLI,"" added Strother. ""Many of our members are already working to improve their sustainability practices. This outside, neutral verification by the SSCF assures the credibility of their efforts. This is especially important in light of the fact that more and more 3PL customers are requiring their supply chain partners to adopt 'greenâ practices throughout their operations.""

The IWLA has selected SSCF to be the neutral, third party verifying partner

June 30, 2011 â Washington, DC - The International Warehouse Logistics Association (IWLA, www.iwla.com) has selected the Sustainable Supply Chain Foundation (SSCF, www.sustainable-scf.org) to be the neutral, third party verifying partner in its newly launched Sustainable Logistics Initiative (SLI). The SLI is a cutting edge tool, designed by the IWLA specifically for its members, with which companies can easily assess and quantify the sustainability of individual warehouse/logistics facilities.

Using the SLI self assessment, IWLA member third party logistics facilities and companies will be able to demonstrate their sustainability practices to existing and potential customers and to the market in general. The SLI, after establishing a sustainability base-line for each facility enrolled, will provide the capability to monitor, track and verify sustainability practices in areas such as energy usage, water consumption and waste disposal. The Sustainable Supply Chain Foundation will independently and neutrally verify SLI assessment results.

The SLI is designed to be a continuous improvement tool for IWLA members.

The IWLA, which has been in existence since 1891, is the leading warehouse trade association in North America. The nearly 500 member companies provide a wide range of logistics services including warehousing, transportation, value-added services and consulting. IWLAâs members are committed to protecting the free flow of products domestically and across international borders in the most efficient, cost-effective and sustainable manner.

The SSCF provides consultation services, funds and conducts research related to sustainability in global and domestic supply chain and transportation-related industries. It also works to identify and assess best practices and emerging technologies that advance sustainability in every aspect of supply chain management.

Third-Party Logistics (3PL),https://dhl-freight-connections.com/en/logistics-dictionary/third-party-logistics-3pl/,N/A,"What is Third-Party Logistics?

Third-party logistics, also known as 3PL, is a system where an organisation (a third party) provides logistics services to companies in need of inventory management and distribution. The company (client) with no logistics department usually employs the help of the 3PL company. In turn, the 3PL performs parts or all logistics related activities for the client.

Some of the activities carried out by the third-party logistics are:

Inventory storage

Inventory management

Freight forwarding

Shipping and distribution

Customs clearance/declaration

Packaging and warehousing

And more (depending on arrangement)

To enhance the activities 3PL companies, Fourth Party Logistics (4PL) was introduced. The 4PL company controls and manages all supply chain processes of the client.",3PL sustainability innovations
3PL Automation Solutions,https://www.hairobotics.com/solutions/3pl-solutions,N/A,"1. Increasing competition: As the demand for 3PL services grows, more companies are entering the market, resulting in heightened competition.

2. Rising customer expectations: Customers demand faster delivery times, higher levels of shipment visibility, and more personalized services.

3. Capacity constraints: During peak seasons, 3PLs may face capacity constraints as they try to meet the growing demand for their services.

4. Talent shortage: The logistics industry is facing a shortage of skilled workers, making it difficult for 3PLs to find and retain talent.

5. Global economic uncertainty: Global economic uncertainty, geopolitical tensions, and trade policy changes can impact supply chain and logistics operations, presenting challenges for 3PLs.

Therefore, more 3PL companies are seeking warehouse automation solutions to improve their operations and stay competitive in the market.",3PL sustainability innovations
3PL Digital Transformation for Better Fulfilment Processes,https://www.canary7.com/3pl-digital-transformation/,N/A,"In order to curb the many different challenges you face as a third party logistics organisation, digital 3PL fulfilment is the only way forward. With the help of new and the right technologies, it becomes easier to evolve to a point where the aforementioned hurdles can easily be tackled. With the help of technologies that give way to 3PL digital transformation, you can dominate the 3PL game and establish yourself as a leader in the industry.

At Canary7, that’s exactly what we aim towards: connecting you with the right digital transformation features and software solutions, so that you are well-equipped for any 3PL problem that may come your way. With the help of the software solutions we provide you with, you can increase your responsiveness, speed, and integration – all of which lead to not only you creating a considerably more organised ecosystem out of your warehouse and fulfilment centres. Not only that, but the technologies we introduce you to also improve your data generation tactics and we all know, data is the most powerful tool when it comes to your 3PL organisation becoming a part of the digital revolution.

Canary7 – Your new partner in success

By allowing Canary7 to be your partner in success, you are optimising your supply chain in a way that it can support all your operations seamlessly, without requiring too much time, commitment, or money. Not only that, but it also calls for better crisis management and allows you to deal with problems in a much more advanced manner – ultimately leading to a point where mistakes, errors, and problems are minimised altogether and don’t lead to bigger problems for you in the long run.

The best part of the 3PL digital transformation, at least for us at Canary7, is that it is not completely dependent on technology. For us, the 3PL digital transformation is all about the correct balance: the correct balance between an advanced technological setup as well as the optimisation of the human element present at your organisation.

Yes, you heard that right. Our software solutions are not geared towards letting robots rule the planet. Instead, they are focused towards integrating different aspects of your business together so that your workforce is better equipped to put their best foot forward and make an impact that they, and you, want to make on the business. 3PL digital transformation with the help of Canary7 is ultimately an effort that is more focused towards developing processes that empower your workforce, instead of making strides to remove them from the picture entirely. At Canary7, we truly believe that there is no bigger asset than your workforce – which is why we go to great lengths to ensure that they are well-accommodated and that there are no problems that they have to deal with for the sake of 3PL digital transformation.

Modern Freight Company Appoints X-NOOR To Reduce Its ...,https://www.cbnme.com/news/modern-freight-company-x-noor/,N/A,"This project showcases X-NOOR and MFC’s joint dedication to advancing sustainability in Dubai’s logistics industry

The region’s newest force in sustainable solutions, X-NOOR, a joint venture between X-ELIO, a global leader in solar solutions, and DUTCO, a leader in infrastructure projects in the GCC region, proudly announces an agreement with Modern Freight Company (MFC), one of the key players in Dubai’s logistics industry, to provide renewable energy at MFC’s Logistics Park and Logistics Center in Dubai, for the next 20 years.

The collaboration highlights both company’s efforts towards a greener future with a rooftop solar PV installation expected to produce around 18 GWh of energy over 20 years. Through this installation, the warehouse will be powered by 100% renewable energy, which will significantly reduce CO2 consumption compared to the previous source.

X-NOOR is an innovative solar developer with offices in Riyadh, Dubai, and Abu Dhabi and ongoing operations in Oman and Bahrain. With its commitment to ensuring the highest level of international and regional standards, the renowned solar developer is implementing sustainable solutions to harness the region’s abundance of solar power.

Founded in 1977, MFC is deemed one of the UAE’s most trusted logistics companies, excelling in warehousing, international freight forwarding, and customs clearance. Strategically positioned next to Jebel Ali port berths, MFC’s warehouses offer not just convenience, but also the highest standards in sustainability.

Beyond its operational excellence, MFC has received multiple awards and commendations for its efforts in sustainability, such as the Sustainable 3pl Logistics Company of the Year 2022 at the Freightweek Sustainability Awards and the CSR/Sustainability Initiatives Provider of the Year 2022 at the Landmarks in Logistics Awards which is perfectly in line with X-NOOR’s mission.

Jesus Gutierrez, the General Manager of X-NOOR, said of the company’s expansion efforts, “We are thrilled to expand our operations and bring our innovative solar solutions to more projects across the region. We look forward to forging new partnerships and contributing to the region’s renewable energy goals with the same passion and dedication that has driven our success in the Middle East.”

Meanwhile, Laurance Langdon, General Manager of Modern Freight Company emphasised: “At MFC, we recognise the importance of adopting sustainable and environmentally friendly business practices. The partnership with X-NOOR will allow us to utilise their expertise to maximise the generation of clean energy ensuring we continue to minimise our carbon footprint and offer a net zero facility for our customers.”",3PL sustainability innovations
Global 3PLs Focused on Increasing Customer Demands ...,https://damore-mckim.northeastern.edu/news/surveys-find-global-3pls-focused-on-increasing-customer-demands-technology-industry-restructuring-and-amazon/,N/A,"Orlando, September 26, 2016 – Today, the findings of the 23rd Annual Surveys of Third Party Logistics (3PL) Provider CEOs in North America and Europe were presented at the Annual Meeting of the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals by Dr. Robert Lieb, Professor of Supply Chain Management at the D'Amore-McKim School of Business at Northeastern University.

The surveys, which involved CEOs of 22 of the largest global third party logistics companies, addressed a broad variety of topics including 3PL industry dynamics, the growth of their E-commerce business, the impact of recent consolidations on the industry, the importance of technology in the industry, and Amazon's continued movement into 3PL-like activities.

North American Survey Results

Profitability and Revenue Growth Projections

This year's North American survey included the CEOs of 14 of the world's largest 3PLs. All reported their companies had been profitable in 2015 and all believed the regional 3PL industry had also been profitable for the year. They were asked to forecast revenue growth for their companies and the regional 3PL industry for the one and three year time frames. The average one-year company projection was 7.8% with the three-year projection averaging 8.6%. Their regional industry projections were 3.6% and 5.5% for the one and three year periods respectively.

North American E-Commerce Marketplace

The E-commerce marketplace in North America continues to grow and evolve. It has become an increasingly important revenue source for 3PLs. On average, it comprises approximately 14% of the revenue base of the 14 companies involved in the North American survey, and their E-commerce revenues grew by an average of 18.46% in the past year. According to the CEOs there were a number of significant changes in that marketplace in the past year. These changes included: steadily increasing customer demands for shorter delivery cycles, delivery trips becoming shorter as retailers were pressured to market position inventory, the growth of E-commerce of heavier goods outpaced the growth of package goods, returns became a bigger problem/3PL opportunity, and massive investments by Amazon and Walmart exerted real pressure on other retailers to change their strategies to compete.

Lieb noted, “While the growth of E-commerce presents real opportunities for North American 3PLs, they are also faced with challenges to deliver the required speed and visibility technology while being pressured by the larger E-commerce companies to continuously reduce rates.”

Aftermath of West Coast Port Problems

Employee slowdowns during 2014-2015 at West Coast ports caused major problems for shippers moving products through those ports including long-delays, shipments stuck in ports, long transit times and lost sales due to late deliveries. The slowdown ended when a new five-year contract with the unions was signed and in the 2015 survey few 3PL CEOs believed that their key customers would significantly change their reliance upon those ports as a result of those problems. However, in the 2016 North American survey eleven 3PL CEOs reported that some key customers had changed their port strategies. Those changes included specifying use of East Coast ports, increased use of the expanded Panama Canal, moving freight through Houston, shipping to the West Coast of Mexico and Canada, shifting more souring and manufacturing to Mexico, and working with 3PLs to develop port contingency strategies.

Most Important North American 3PL Industry Dynamics/Problems

The CEOs involved in the North American survey identified the most important industry dynamics as rapidly changing technology, a continuing industry talent shortage, uncertain economic conditions, and the rapid growth of E-commerce. Those dynamics also drive their most pressing problems that were identified as finding and keeping talented employees, keeping pace with rapidly changing technology, coping with increasing customer service level expectations, and dealing with unpredictable economic conditions.

European Survey Results

European 3PL Profitability and Revenue Growth Projections

This year's European survey included the CEOs of five of the world's largest 3PLs. Four companies met or exceeded their revenue growth projections in 2015, and four also reported profitability for the year. All five believed the regional 3PL industry had been profitable for the years. They were asked to forecast revenue growth for their companies and the regional 3PL industry for the one and three-year time frames. The average one-year company projection was 5.2% with the three-year projection averaging 7.6%. Their regional industry projections were 3.4% and 4.0% for the one and three-year periods respectively.

European E-commerce Marketplace

While the European E-commerce marketplace continues to grow, on average E-commerce revenues comprise only 5.4% of the revenue base of the companies involved in this survey. Those revenues grew at an average of 5.0% last year, and that growth rate was disappointing to those companies that anticipated a much more substantial growth rate. They noted significant changes in the E-commerce marketplace in Europe in the past year, with those changes including continued growth despite a stagnant European economy, Amazon becoming much more aggressive in promoting more rapid deliveries, many retailers developing omni-channel strategies to remain competitive and having difficulties financing those strategies. The margins of those retailers are quite thin, their costs are steadily increasing as returns become more of a problem. While the 3PLs serving Europe certainly want to participate in the growth of E-commerce they find it increasingly difficult to do so while also generating profits. Amazon and others are driving transport and storage rates down to levels that aren't sustainable. Also, much E-commerce volume comes on weekends and that poses staffing issues to 3PLs.

Most important European 3PL Industry Dynamics/Problems

According to the European survey respondents there was no significant rebound in the market for 3PL services in the past year. That coupled with the continued weakness of the global economy, uncertainties related to Brexit, and the continued restructuring of the European 3PL industry related to mergers and acquisitions is of major concern to these companies. 3PL competition has intensified and security costs have risen. This is leading many 3PLs in the European marketplace to give more emphasis to pursuing opportunities in emerging markets unpredictable economic conditions..

Additional 3PL Industry Trends and Insights

Mergers and Acquisitions

Between 2014 and 2015 there was an unprecedented wave of mergers and acquisitions in the 3PL industry. In the 2016 survey the CEOs were asked to address the potential long-term impact of those mergers and acquisitions on the 3PL industry. They suggested that the larger companies will emerge as stronger brands and that they will displace many 3PLs that lack scale. Their purchasing power will lower their costs and they will reflect that by lowering prices in the marketplace. They will invest heavily in technology and use technology as a differentiation factor. Other 3PLs will aggressively seek new partnerships/alliances to be able to compete effectively. However, the larger consolidated companies will also have to manage a broad-range of post-acquisition problems to realize the potential value of those consolidations.

Technology

The CEOs were asked to identify the three most significant technology developments in the 3PL industry in the past three years. The most frequently cited developments improvements in visibility software, the expansion of mobile apps, customer acceptance of cloud based solutions, and more extensive use of warehouse automation and robotics. Potential was also noted in the use of driverless vehicles, drones, and 3D printing.

Big Data and Data Analytics

Twelve CEOs reported use of Big Data/data analytics in their companies and seventeen said they planned to use them in the future. They reported current applications in a wide variety of areas including measuring operating performance, network modeling, demand management, matching freight to capacity, understanding customer attributes/attractiveness, and assisting customers in process improvements.

Amazon's Impact on the 3PL Marketplace

For the past several years these annual surveys have tracked Amazon's impact on the 3PL marketplace. Its volume is a significant source of revenues to many 3PLs, and its recent actions also pose potential competitive threats to 3PLs. These dynamics were noted once again in the responses to this year's survey. Among the developments in the past year noted by the CEOs were Amazon's moves into selling heavier goods, its constant focus on faster deliveries, its pressure on 3PLs to reduce rates, and its recent moves to expand its internal transportation capabilities. The surveys have tracked Amazon's evolution into 3PL-Like operations in the past several years, and fourteen of the twenty-one CEOs said that Amazon is already a 3PL!

Lieb said, “There is no question that Amazon poses a long-term threat to 3PLs. As it continues to expand its transportation and storage capabilities it also increases its ability to leverage those assets in the 3PL marketplace. At the same time, it increases Amazon's financial vulnerability during downturns in the global economy.”

Uber

The last several annual surveys have addressed Uber's potential in providing last-mile delivery services to support E-commerce activities, and this year seven CEOs reported that Uber now provides some last-mile delivery services in their markets.

Terrorism

As the worldwide threat of terrorism has expanded, that threat has been acknowledged and addressed by many 3PLs. Eight CEOs categorized the threat of terrorism as being very significant or significant in their planning process and fifteen of the companies involved in this year's surveys now address terrorism in formal business continuity plans. Those companies have taken a wide variety of steps to reduce the threats to their companies and five reported being asked by some customers for assistance in addressing terrorist concerns in their organizations.

Survey Design

Twenty-one CEOs of large third-party logistics companies across North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific completed surveys via an Internet-based questionnaire during the summer of 2016. Companies participating in the annual survey included: Agility Logistics, CEVA Logistics, Cardinal Logistics, Coyote Logistics, DHL Excel Supply Chain, DSC Logistics, Kuehne + Nagel Logistics, Inc., MIQ Logistics, Nippon Express, Panalpina, Rhenus Contract Logistics, Transplace, UPS Supply Chain Solutions, Werner Logistics, XPO Logistics and Yusen Logistics.

Green Road Energy & Hultsteins Bring Sustainable ...,https://www.dcvelocity.com/articles/61017-green-road-energy-hultsteins-bring-sustainable-refrigeration-solutions-to-the-us-uk,N/A,"Green Road Energy in cool US/UK sustainability swap

Green Road Energy has teamed up with UK/Sweden sustainable refrigeration manufacturer Hultsteins in a move to bring each company’s carbon and cost saving transport solutions to both sides of the Atlantic.

Based in Lakeland, Florida, Green Road Energy is a designer and producer of energy preservation systems which harness wind, solar power and vehicle-generated energy to provide low-cost clean electricity for auxiliary systems on trucks and trailers.

The company’s innovative TAG (turbine auxiliary generator) system is fast becoming popular with fleet operators in the US. Mounted to the trailer chassis and using simple wind-turbine technology, the system bypasses the alternator and engine to generate electricity for liftgates, fridge units, lighting and auxiliary batteries.

While the vehicle is on the road, says Green Road Energy, the TAG system significantly reduces diesel fuel consumption and emissions as it constantly generates renewable wind energy, displaces carbon-intensive power sources and brings operating costs down.

Trailer refrigeration – without the diesel

Designed specifically to bypass the diesel engine on all conventional trailer refrigeration units, Hultsteins’ Ecogen2 is a slim-fit hydraulic drive generator which plugs in to any make of diesel/electric TRU to supply a constant 400-volt, 3-phase electrical power, even at idle.

Connected to the tractor’s PTO, Ecogen2 draws power directly from the tractor engine. The energy produced powers the trailer’s refrigeration unit on electric standby during transit, all the while, reducing CO2 by around 90%, DPM by 90% and NOx by around 400%. Thereby virtually eliminating all harmful diesel emissions and permanently keeping costs down.

Reynolds Logistics, a UK - national food service provider, is now in its third year with Hultsteins and has recently placed a third order for Ecogen2. Not only this, but the company is also fitting its first Green Road Energy TAG systems to test on its temperature- controlled rigid units.

Further to a recent visit to Hultsteins in England, Green Road Energy’s Chief Technical Officer, Brian Arnold commented: “I had the opportunity to see the Ecogen2 in action and was thoroughly impressed by its innovative approach to sustainable refrigeration. Recognizing its potential to transform the transportation industry, I was motivated to bring this cutting-edge technology to the United States.

“After successful negotiations,” added Brian, “Green Road Energy is now proud to be the official distributor of Ecogen2 in America, offering fleet operators a powerful solution to enhance efficiency and reduce environmental impact.”

“Both these energy efficient systems are easy to retrofit and use inexpensive, basic technology to reduce running costs and slash harmful emissions,” says Hultsteins’ UK Managing Director Graham Usher. “Ecogen is widely used in Europe and the TAG system is quickly making a name for itself in the US. Now, with this new alliance, operators on both sides of the water can benefit from these innovative, non-polluting and affordable alternatives to diesel power.”

Digitalized and autonomous transport - challenges and ...,https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/209395,Автор: S Stradner,"Abstract:

Purpose: European Logistics is characterized by a matured infrastructure. Nevertheless, industry has to catch up in terms of digitalized and autonomous transport. The awareness-rising of industrial companies in this area is still limited. Therefore, the paper includes a research in order to find out the reasons for hesitations of manufacturing industry. Methodology: For this purpose, an overview of digitalized and autonomous transport based on a literature research is given and reflected at the beginning. The focus is on new concepts to demonstrate the potentials to handle actual challenges. Subsequently, an empirical study is conducted, on which 138 manufacturing companies have participated. Findings: The empirical study shows that governmental institutions have to work out a legal framework. Manufacturing companies are still sceptical of trends in digitalized and autonomous transport logistics. Logistics Managers still see barriers in the fields of security and infrastructure. Actually they see low chances in the next years. Originality: Current transport logistics trend analyses usually do not challenge the topic of digitalized and autonomous transport from the users point of view. Manufacturing companies have to face a variety of challenges in the field of transport. By conducting the research, the current state and hesitations of management can be outlined.",trucking logistics digital transformations

How Start-Ups Are Digitalizing Logistics,https://www.oliverwyman.com/our-expertise/insights/2017/sep/oliver-wyman-transport-and-logistics-2017/innovations/how-start-ups-digitalize-logistics.html,N/A,"THE RACE TO INVEST

In a recent study, we identified more than 400 start-ups worldwide that could eat into the competitive advantages of logistics incumbents. Five major star t-up clusters dominate the landscape: online platforms, asset management solutions, robotics/ autonomous vehicles, shipping execution & tracking, and data & analytics solutions. A large percentage of new logistics start-ups are focused on online platforms and data-driven services – areas that are easily scalable and require little fixed-cost investment. But rapid technological evolution means that all identified start-up clusters are seeing a steady stream of new entrants.

While funding is still not at the level of leading business-to-consumer and sharing economy disruptors, logistics start-ups are attracting serious investor interest – more than $11 billion in investments over the past decade. The top ten global logistics start-ups have received around half of this funding. In line with increasing amounts of funding for logistics start-ups, annual funding rounds have quadrupled since 2007.

MAJOR LOGISTICS START-UP CLUSTERS

CHALLENGES FOR INCUMBENTS

Major logistics incumbents have started to carefully invest in digital start-ups. UPS, for example, has developed a Strategic Enterprise Fund to invest in start-ups that complement its footprint – to the tune of some $600 million across 24 investments. DHL has selectively invested in start-ups that promise short- to mid-term leverage, such as Streetscooter, which is developing cost-efficient electric delivery vehicles. And DB Schenker is working with American freight exchange Uship to improve surface transport utilization.

Logistics incumbents are facing intense competition however for the best partners and targets. This competition is coming from outside of the transport and logistics space, and includes a broad range of heavy hitters: Technology giants such as Amazon and Alibaba are investing in start-ups to innovate in last-mile delivery, while others, like Google and SAP, are looking more broadly at advances in big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. Mobility providers such as BMW and Mercedes are developing passenger and cargo transport platforms as well as autonomous driving solutions. And venture capitalists are leveraging their networks and experience in business-to-consumer to quickly scale up asset-light business models in fast-growing areas of logistics.

These moves suggest that the key challenge for logistics incumbents may be that they are not integrating and adapting to technological disruption quickly enough to capture competitive opportunities before outside investors do. And start-up investments could be a critical path to leapfrogging the challenges of digitalization for large logistics organizations.

Start-ups can quickly signal which next-gen changes are worth pursuing and which aren’t, because they have the flexibility to test and evolve innovative solutions in an agile way. Invested incumbents can then leverage surviving trends to optimize their own operations and improve digital integration with their clients’ supply chains and production processes.",trucking logistics digital transformations

Digitization is studied in a broader sense as a process of transition from traditional organization into a digital one. The paper presents the author’s classification of digital transformation of a traditional organization into digital, and includes six possible potential levels of digital maturity at present time, as per the degree of automation of production and organizational processes. Based on a sociological survey data, a subjective view of specialists from HR services in the transport-logistics economic sector is presented; this view allows us to understand the depth of digitalization processes in HR departments and the organizations as a whole. The conducted analysis showed that the extent of automation of HR processes in transport and logistical organizations is lower than the extent of automation of main HR processes. At the same time the respondents have highly appreciated the extent of integration of main HR processes. The survey results have shown a higher extent of integration of HR processes and a better-defined strategic approach in the work with personnel of transport-logistics organizations, as compared to data of all the respondents. The conducted survey enables us to make specific perspective actions which would make it possible to recalibrate automation of HR processes in the transport-logistics sector of economy.

Agglomerations or metropolitan areas are large urbanized areas that usually consist of a core and periphery, characterized by a high population density and a well-developed transport network. An increase in the load on the infrastructure of the largest agglomerations due to the continuing influx of Russian population. As a result of overloading the transport infrastructure, environmental problems worsen, leading to a deterioration in the health of the population and an increase in the costs of the health system. Increasing the load on the management system of the largest agglomerations. Compression of small and medium-sized cities: the reduction of tax revenues with the continuing burden on the city budget and infrastructure will not allow to qualitatively improve the standard of living of citizens.

The Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation told how the digitalization of the transport industry is going on

On May 15, 2024, at the international exhibition-forum To Moscow Ministry of Transport Ministry of Industry and Trade in and held a plenary session ""Technological Leadership: Transport Mobility. Prospects for the digitalization of the transport complex and the development of unmanned technologies. "" The event focused on the development of digital technologies in the transport sector, including in the field of unmanned vehicles.

The development of transport and logistics is impossible without digital technologies. This is already obvious, - says Deputy Minister of Transport Dmitry Bakanov. - I think no one buys tickets, does not go to the station ticket office, does not buy for cash, does not take paper receipts to put in his pocket, does not pay in cash for public transport, does not transfer money to the conductor. We even order food home through a courier, we don't go to the store. People stopped buying cars because there is car sharing, and there is also ""drone"" ahead. It develops on all types of transport.

The Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation told how there takes place digitalization of the industry

Bakanov said that by May 2024, more than 30 million kilometers were driven by unmanned taxis on Innopolis, Moscow and Sirius. The driver has already been transferred from the main seat to the passenger seat, in the future he will not be in the cabin at all, he said.

The deputy head of the Ministry of Transport touched upon the development and integration of unmanned aviation systems into a single airspace, which, according to Bakanov, should speed up their implementation in various sectors of the economy. By mid-May 2024, about 100 thousand units were taken into account, over the past year more than 175 thousand flight missions have been completed, Dmitry Bakanov noted.

The Ministry of Transport also said that in the summer of 2024, unmanned trains will be launched on the Moscow Central Ring (MCC), in which the driver will only monitor the operation of the control system. And for 2026, the launch of the train without a person in the cab is scheduled. Expected. that first the operator-operator will be able to remotely control the work of two unmanned vehicles at once, and in the future - four at once.

The development of autopilots also occurs in the segment of water transport. So, at the end of 2023, the movement of marine autonomous vessels was launched on the Ust-Luga - Baltiysk line: ""General Chernyakhovsky"" and ""Marshal Rokossovsky.""

Another topic of Dmitry Bakanov's speech was domestic software in the transport industry. According to the deputy minister, the ""first swallow"" was the transition to Russian air ticket booking systems. By mid-May 2024, about 150 million tickets were issued through them. The second project in this area is the Aviation Service Platform, which allows you to transmit telegraph flights. This decision by May 2025 uses 56 airports, 12 Russian and 13 foreign carriers. Since its launch, more than 70 million messages have been processed, said the deputy head of the Ministry of Transport.

Among the successful Russian developments, he also mentioned the transportation management systems to which the railway is switching: ASU Express (allows you to buy tickets) and ETRAN (exchange of electronic transportation documents).

Speaking about the plans for the digitalization of the transport industry, Bakanov said in mid-May 2024 that within two years it is planned to create the GosLog National Digital Transport and Logistics Platform, which should remove paper documents from the market, which will allow for end-to-end traceability with multimodal transportation of all goods.

Another project is a single passenger platform, which will consist of control systems for the state of city electric transport, management of preferential transportation, the Federal Navigation Information System for online monitoring of traffic and arrival of transport, control of passenger interregional transportation and their legality.[1]

Russia is creating a single window platform that will unite all GIS in the field of transport and logistics

In early April 2024, it became known that a national digital transport and logistics platform GosLog and an electronic register of notifications about the transportation of goods were being created in Russia. The goals of the project are the formation of legal conditions and mechanisms that ensure the protection of the interests of consumers of transport services, as well as improving the quality and safety of cargo transportation by road.

Chernyshenko: 19 transport digitalization projects for 27.2 billion rubles are being implemented in Russia

In Russia, there are four industrial competence centers (ICCs) engaged in the development of digital solutions for the transport industries. As part of these initiatives, 19 projects are being implemented in the amount of 27.2 billion rubles. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko spoke about this on November 15, 2023.

An important component of such a transformation is the digitalization of the transport sector. The updated digital transformation strategy of the transport industry has been supplemented with a new project to ensure information security at critical information infrastructure facilities. In it, we pay key attention to the introduction of artificial intelligence, - said the Deputy Prime Minister.

Dmitry Chernyshenko

Chernyshenko called the creation of the National Digital Transport and Logistics Platform one of Russia's key international projects in the field of digitalization of transport. Thanks to the platform, the average delivery speed of goods is expected to increase to 15%, and the volume of cargo transportation will grow to 12%.

The Deputy Prime Minister also said that Russian IT developments in the field of transport have high export potential. As an example of a successful project, he named the domestic reservation system Leonarod, which by November 2023 operates in Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Belarus, and from 2024 will be introduced by the largest air carrier in Venezuela.

In addition, according to Chernyshenko, it is planned to conduct an experiment to abandon paper document management when importing and exporting cargo with sea containers on the Vladivostok - Moscow route. According to forecasts, by the end of 2024 the number of electronic transportation documents will reach 10 million units.

Dmitry Chernyshenko also noted that the list of transport services for citizens is expanding. For example, automation of 50 services in the field of transport is provided, 31 of which have already been launched on the portal of public services. The most popular services were vehicle registration and obtaining a driver's license.[2]

Mishustin approved the strategy for the digital transformation of the transport industry until 2030

Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin signed a decree approving the strategy for the digital transformation of the transport industry in Russia until 2030. The corresponding document was published in early November 2023.

According to the order, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, together with interested departments, was instructed to ensure the implementation of the strategic direction in the field of digital transformation of the transport industry. Its goals are named:

provision of high-quality public services to the population;

improving the quality of transport and logistics services (increasing their availability, speed and cost);

development of ""seamless"" domestic and international transportation;

ensuring the safety and reliability of these transportations;

reduced load on the environment.

Mikhail Mishustin approved the strategy of digital transformation of the transport industry

According to the plans of the authors of the strategy, by 2030, minimizing the human factor on the roads will lead to a reduction in road accidents by at least 2%. The cargo traffic of unmanned vehicles will grow at least three times. It is also expected that traffic of highly automated vehicles on the Neva M-11 highway will amount to 11,000 units in 2024, and commercial cargo turnover - 143.16 cubic meters. m per km.

The document also predicts that the number of transport infrastructure facilities using biometrics to admit passengers will reach 150 units by 2027, and by 2030 they plan to increase the number to 700 (this plan is laid down in the direction of the ""Green Digital Passenger Corridor"").

The digital transformation strategy for the transport industry also says that unmanned cargo delivery will be available on 48 routes in 2024. In addition, the document notes that 2024 year Russia will be allowed to operate 16 unmanned aerial systems, and 2035 year the export of Russian civilian drones may begin.

According to the press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, commenting on the adoption of a new strategy, within the framework of updating the strategic direction, taking into account the analysis of the main trends and restrictions of the industry, the list of projects and initiatives for the digital transformation of the transport industry has been clarified.

The department also noted that as part of the renewal of the strategic direction, current digital projects of the transport industry have been preserved, while already implemented ones have been excluded. At the same time, the strategic direction is supplemented by a new project related to ensuring information security at critical information infrastructure facilities.

Special attention in the strategic direction is paid to the introduction of artificial intelligence in the transport industry

Special attention in the strategic direction is paid to the introduction of artificial intelligence in the transport industry. The use of AI is provided for in most of the projects included in the strategic direction, such as Unmanned Logistics Corridors, Autonomous Navigation, Unmanned Aviation Systems, Green Digital Passenger Corridor, Seamless Cargo Logistics.

It follows from the strategy that the result of the implementation of the Autonomous Navigation project should be a new look of the transport industry in the field of navigation through the development and introduction of innovative technologies. So, according to the document, it is planned to create an autonomous port fleet of one unit in 2024 and three in 2025.

In 2024, it is also envisaged to introduce elements of the coastal infrastructure for autonomous navigation and domestic samples of ship equipment for autonomous navigation. For this, research (development) work will be carried out.

The 8 main IT trends of the transport industry are named

In August 2023, the team of the Intersectoral Center for Technology Transfer and the Research Center in the Field of IIUnnivalence Innopolis prepared an open patent and marketing report ""Application of artificial intelligence in priority sectors of the economy."" This document, among other things, lists trends in terms of digitalization of the transport industry. Special emphasis is placed on the possibilities of artificial intelligence.

Unmanned vehicles

AI systems are used to ensure safety, monitor the road situation and identify possible emergencies. AI-driven vehicles are programmed to respond more quickly, including braking in emergency situations. The systems communicate with each other wirelessly, which allows you to avoid driving along the same routes, occupy the roadway, and avoid collisions and congestion. They can also predict bottlenecks and adjust routes accordingly. Also, unmanned vehicles are used in taxis.

AI systems are used to ensure safety, monitor the road situation and identify possible emergency situations

Sustainable transport

Electric vehicles or solar-powered machines reduce their environmental impact. While these technologies are possible without AI, they work more efficiently when energy expenditure is controlled by artificial intelligence, which can predict traffic on roads to offer better solutions for cars, including self-driving ones.

Keyless vessels

AI is also being introduced into the shipping industry to make it more efficient and cost-effective, including one option to reduce costs - the creation of keyless vessels. Thus, Rolls-Royce entered into a partnership agreement with Google to integrate AI into ships.

Projections of delays

In air transport, an acute problem is associated with flight delays. This not only leads to financial losses, but also negatively affects the impression of customers. Using computer vision and data analysis, aviation can improve customers' flight experiences by reducing wait times and offering better services. With AI, aviation companies can track delays in real time and inform passengers in advance.

Traffic control systems are one of the applications of AI in transport

Traffic management

Traffic control systems are one of the applications of AI in transport. Artificial intelligence can help in traffic management by offering optimal routes, can offer time when more free traffic is expected to plan the most profitable routes for any mode of transport. AI is capable of controlling traffic lights and parking lots, it can be used to monitor traffic in the area of ​ ​ construction sites or accidents so that drivers are informed and can avoid possible delays.

Vehicle Fleet Management

The AI system will help you manage the company: for example, control the location of drivers using GPS, assess the driver's condition, predict various situations and car breakdowns. The system is capable of transmitting real-time updates to fleet managers for prompt response.

Recognizing license plates and objects

automated identification of license plates includes systems of cameras based on computer vision, attached to street poles, overpasses and highways to fix the license plate and the location of the car. The technology is good for the police.

Document Management Optimization

The transport industry is associated with a large number of documents, the work with which digital technologies help to optimize. In particular, it provides text recognition, digitization and transfer of data to online systems.

According to the head of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, in the conditions of sanctions pressure, the department has taken measures in an accelerated mode to transfer the industry to domestic digital solutions. Particular attention is paid to increasing the competitiveness and attractiveness of services in the field of passenger and cargo transportation, he stressed.

Vladimir Putin and Minister of Transport of the Russian Federation Vitaly Savelyev

In terms of road transport, the minister spoke about the state information system of electronic transportation documents (GIS EPD), which has been operating since the fall of 2022. The Federal Tax Service, the Ministry of Digital Industry and the Ministry of Digital Development Affairs of Russia participated in the development of the system.

The system allows you to draw up 6 types of transport documents in electronic form, among them the most massive - a waybill and a waybill. The system will remove about 5 billion paper documents from circulation annually, - said Vitaly Savelyev.

He also mentioned the state system of toll collection on the federal highways ""Plato,"" launched in the fall of 2015. During the work, more than 1.7 million vehicles were registered in the system, more than 200 billion rubles were transferred to the road fund (by June 2023). With these funds, 1.1 thousand km of roads in the regions of Russia were repaired in 2022 alone.

It also follows from Savelyev's report that in 2023 the interface was completed and constant information interaction of the state automated information system ERA-GLONASS"""" with Systems-112 EMERCOM of Russia in 85 regions was ensured. The number of machines with ERA-GLONASS devices exceeded 9 million units.

In the last [2022] year alone, the number of emergency calls that ensured the arrival of services at the so-called ""golden hour"" exceeded 12 million, which is 40% more than in 2021. This directly affects the safety and safety of lives on the roads, - said the head of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation.

Vitaly Savelyev reported to the head of state on the work on the digitalization of the country's transport complex

According to the Minister of Transport of the Russian Federation, the projects ""Unmanned Trains,"" ""Virtual Coupling"" are being implemented on railway transport, until 2023 the EPD GIS will be linked with the ETRAN railway transportation document processing system, and the Autonomous Navigation project is being implemented on sea transport.

Digitalization projects are being implemented at checkpoints across the state border. Since March 2020, an electronic navigation seal has been used for the transportation of certain groups of goods. Significant unloading of border points will be facilitated by the project on the introduction of an electronic queue, which is being implemented for the first time in Russia. It will be launched gradually: for trucks by the end of 2023, it will work at the Zabaikalsk, Chernyshevskoye and Bugristoe automobile checkpoints.

Speaking about promising technologies of the industry, the minister recalled that on June 14, 2023, the movement of KamAZ unmanned trucks along the M-11 highway was launched. By June 2023, in accordance with the provisions of the experimental legal regime, unmanned traffic is carried out with a tester in the cabin of a truck, by analogy with passenger car drones.

During the duration of the experimental legal regime, we will go to full unmanned control, the minister added.

Another result of the project will be the development of a business model of unmanned movement of trucks, which will make it possible to scale the market for such transportation due to its commercial viability.

The Ministry of Transport of Russia is digitalizing transport at the level of the best global trends and technologies. We have tremendous potential in this area, and I am absolutely sure that our specialists will continue to demonstrate high professionalism and level of competence, - concluded Vitaly Savelyev.[3]

2022: Chernyshenko: 20 billion rubles are allocated for import substitution of software in the transport industry

In mid-November 2022, Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Chernyshenko spoke about the costs of import substitution of information technologies in transport.

The transport industry itself allocates almost 20 billion rubles to create, replace, import software, - said Chernyshenko on November 15, 2022.

Dmitry Chernyshenko

According to him, large industrial companies spent about 200 billion rubles only on licenses for foreign software per year.

Chernyshenko noted that the first results of import substitution are already there. So, by the end of October 2022, all Russian airlines switched to the domestic booking systems ""Leonardo"" and TAIS.

Many projects that we actually had in a high degree of functionality are able to replace foreign software, they are already with the foreseeable horizons of the release of this software, the Deputy Prime Minister added.

Chernyshenko noted that in the future it is planned, in particular, the development of a domestic inventory system, control of ship traffic in port waters and a digital system for operational control of port operations.

The Deputy Prime Minister separately noted Russian Railways, which is the locomotive for the development of domestic solutions. A national competence center for import substitution of foreign ERP systems has already been created on the basis of the company.

Dmitry Chernyshenko added that the transport industry is one of the most advanced in terms of the use of artificial intelligence: 18% of companies already use AI in their work, about 38% plan to do this in the near future.

He also noted that the number of digital services for passengers and drivers is expanding. In particular, the Ministry of Transport is implementing the project ""Green Digital Passenger Corridor."" Within its framework, convenient services are created for road users, transport connectivity of regions is ensured.[4]

Transport Industry Ready for Digital Transformation

On May 6, 2020, the Ministry of Telecom and Mass Communications of Russia reported that in accordance with the task of transforming priority sectors of the economy and social sphere, established by the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation dated 07.05.2018 No. 204 ""On National Goals and Strategic Objectives of the Development of the Russian Federation for the Period until 2024,"" as well as within the framework of the implementation of the measures of the national program ""Digital Economy,"" aimed at promoting the digital transformation of priority sectors of the economy, the Ministry of Communications of Russia with the participation of the Department of Digital Transformation of the Ministry of Transport of Russia, key industry associations and expert organizations launched a study to assess readiness for digital transformation of the transport and logistics industries.

The purpose of the study is to assess the level of readiness of industries, determine the best solutions and practices in this area, as well as identify segments of industries and companies that can primarily become drivers of a successful digital transformation of the economy.

The study analyzes data from Russian and international statistical sources, analyzes international experience in digitalization of transport and logistics, as well as strategies for digital transformation of a number of Russian companies with state participation.

The study also pays attention to the selection of key state transport and logistics corporations, which will test KPIs for digital transformation, as well as assess their digital readiness.

The Ministry of Communications of Russia, with the assistance of the Department of Digital Transformation of the Ministry of Transport of Russia, initiated a survey of a wide range of specialized companies on readiness for digital transformation, and as of May 6, 2020, leading market players took part in it, forming about 50% of the industry output: companies in the fields of passenger and freight transportation, postal and courier services, as well as logistics companies.

To solve the problems of digital transformation of business processes, expert diagnostics of the company's readiness for digital transformation, acquaintance with the best international and Russian practices of the transport and logistics industries, companies can also take part in a confidential survey.[7]

The results of this work will identify sectors with a high level of digital readiness, identify deterrents, as well as formulate solutions to eliminate emerging barriers to digitalization, including proposals for measures to publicly stimulate the digital transformation of these industries and direct representatives of these areas.

SITA: How 5G rollout will impact the air transport industry

On March 4, 2020, SITA shared six projections of how ultra-fast 5G networks will change the service process for airports, airlines and passengers. With a download speed of up to 400 MB per second, 5G will make a real breakthrough, according to SITA.

As noted in SITA, the potential for innovation is huge: airports, airlines and passengers will discover the possibilities of the 5G network in different ways. SITA's forecasts are based on information technology and new trends in the air transport industry. The assumptions are formed after 5G tests, including the recently conducted Gatwick Airport in London, as well as a trial of new services at Daxing International Airport in Beijing. Both mean a transition to an era of super-connected air travel systems.

""5G is already improving existing programs at airports, for aviation communications, air harbor activities, baggage management and, of course, for passenger data processing. It is a mistake to talk about 5G without mentioning the ""Internet of Things"" (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI) and other applications of the network. For several programs, we have already implemented 4G for IoT, with the aim of biometric screening of passengers. Among these technologies are Smart Path and luggage management. However, the use of 5G will provide much more options, ""

noted Gilles Bloch-Morhange, ATS Products & Solutions, head of SITA Plate

The 5G era is coming fast. According to CSS Insight, there will be 340 million 5G connections globally by 2021, and 2.7 billion by 2025, predominantly in developed markets. In monetary terms, in the aviation industry, the cost of introducing 5G amounted to only $0.2 billion in 2019, but according to forecasts, by 2026 the amount will reach $4.2 billion.

Perspective on the future from SITA: How 5G will be used in 2025:

5G will be the driving force behind IoT technology

5G will soon become commonplace at airports, and the idea of universal intellectual connectivity will prove viable. The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to manage more and more objects and therefore data. 4G technology is capable of supporting 10,000 devices per square kilometer; 5G network can ""cope"" with a million. Several facilities at airports will interact with people, and some will interact with each other.

Thanks to the use of 5G, the connection will be much faster. The new networks will enable massive data streams to be delivered, providing secure and predictable real-time surveillance of airport activities. This will increase the effectiveness of cooperation between airports, airlines, air traffic controllers, ground handling operators and contractors.

The result will be intelligent monitoring of queues throughout the airport, as well as tracking and managing autonomous vehicles that assist passengers in their movement. Vehicles equipped with ramps will be serviced by aircraft or baggage tugs. Wheelchairs, mobile kiosks and robot assistants will be remotely controlled.

It's not just about bandwidth. The short wait times will make autonomous vehicles much safer. With the 5G network, the speed of exchange of digital teams in an emergency situation is much faster, which will allow you to instantly take the necessary security measures.

5G will improve the application of artificial intelligence technologies

Algorithmic intelligence (AI) is the key to solving major problems at airports. For example, biometric identification of passengers and their luggage will become familiar and simple. AI will be able to recognize the abrasions, folds and characteristics of the material in order to distinguish similar bags and compare them with the owner.

Computer, or technical vision using artificial intelligence, will constantly scan the exit areas, reasonably predict problems with the capacity of hand luggage on flights and allow staff to take appropriate measures before boarding.

5G will increase operational efficiency, increase additional revenues and reduce costs

Combining IoT and 5G will provide airlines and airports with ample opportunities to gain tangible business benefits. All airport resources will be connected and connected, making it much easier to monitor efficiency and optimize usage. Such technology, for example, will offer tools to improve the efficiency of vehicles at the airport. As a result, the cost of fuel and resources in general, including labor, will decrease.

5G exploits the potential of ""flying data centers""

5G will give next-generation aircraft the ability to share huge amounts of data at the airport and gate. Instant data transfer and analysis will allow preventive maintenance, speed up the airliner turn, carry out more timely departures and, most importantly, improve the quality of customer service.

The merger of 5G and the satellite system will present a solid approach to solving the problem thanks to a flying IoT device that will connect the aircraft with all the necessary systems.

Airports will monitor the quality of Wi-Fi connections and establish fault management

SITA sees the solution in the licensed and unlicensed 5G frequency spectrum thanks to new network standards. Airports will monitor the quality of service in private and public areas, combining 5G with Wi-Fi networks with the aim of making the connection continuous and ""seamless.""

5G is likely to replace the common digital trunking service, which communications TETRA only supports voice messaging among operational and vital services to secure the connection. Airport staff will receive timely live updates to video and data channels based on location changes. In addition, video surveillances computer channels for vision analysis will be available for staff to support a number of options, including remote. identification

5G to provide automated services for ""digital travellers""

For passengers, the possibilities of augmented reality and personalized mobile services will open up, combining all data from various applications and interaction with virtual reality objects. The airport will provide passengers with up-to-date and timely information, as well as the necessary services in order to provide assistance or entertainment.

HD movies can be downloaded in a few seconds, entire episodes will immediately become available for offline viewing. In addition, passengers will be able to broadcast live sports events in high quality, regardless of the ""congestion"" of the airport network at a particular moment.

Digitization in transport logistics and combined transport,https://www.scs.fraunhofer.de/en/research/digitization-transport-logistics.html,N/A,"The solution to the problems in transport logistics lies in a better use of data. This requires a combination of the following:

Technology

Applications-based data analytics

Sector-wide connectivity of relevant data

Genuine value is created only when there is a swift transfer of data between actors and individual carriers, ideally in real time. This ensures, for example, that information such as consignment data does not go missing during transport. It is only through such measures that transport logistics can be gradually transformed into its digital twin: Transportlogistik 4.0.





Fully connected and digitalized transport processes for Transportlogistik 4.0

By Transportlogistik 4.0, we mean – by analogy with Industrie 4.0 – the use of cyberphysical systems to enhance the management, self-organization and optimization of intercompany transport. Using the latest technology, data is recorded and analyzed during loading, unloading and other transport-related processes. This data enables the creation of a near-real-time digital twin. Following enrichment with further data from IT systems, camera systems or sensors, we then use data analytics to further analyze and optimize this information. On this basis, we are able to derive measures to boost the real-time efficiency of intercompany connectivity and then, for example, set up individual self-managing subsystems or automate various transport handling and invoicing processes.

For this purpose, we are looking at how data from within the transport operation can best be combined with externally available information so as to then provide valid and relevant data, automatically and in real time.",trucking logistics digital transformations

The future is digitalization

The world became digital - a truth not only for logistics but for all parts of life.Â

Many trends have been initiated before the pandemic and peaked in the last months due to global lockdowns. Daily life shifted to virtual working and learning and pushed e-commerce to a new level.Â

A digital life needs digital solutions for the industry to cope with the increasing demands in global trade and rising customer expectations.Â

Why do logistics companies need digital transformation?

Due to the numerous stakeholders in different countries within the supply chain, the digital transformation of businesses and operations is vital.Â

To enhance end-to-end visibility and efficiency, shipping processes and back-office operations have to become digital.Â Real-time freight rates, paperless bills of lading, and automation improve operational efficiency notably.Â

Even though digitalization is not the objective of the business itself, it is needed to enable more transparent and efficient solutions.Â

For a long time, the technology used in the industry like AS400 green screens had not made great leaps.

This has now changed drastically. Most of the important big players within the logistics industry have migrated their systems to more efficient and automated ones.

Digitalization allows them to process e.g. generate inquiries or receive quotes much faster.

According to a Forbes Insights survey, 65 percent of logistics companies recognize switching to the digital business model to survive in the digital age.

âCost and time efficiency through automation

Time is one of the most valuable goods in the logistics industry. Every step and process has to be timed perfectly to guarantee an on-time delivery without any disruption within the supply chain.Â

Very short shipping times let shippers struggle to meet their delivery goals. Delays often cause extra costs like detention and demurrage charges. The very complex operations overall in the maritime supply chain can be enhanced by automation through digitalization.Â

The use of very limited human resources can be optimized by the automation of back-office operations such as emails or faxes or making calls to track freight, get rates, or get the paperwork done.Â

With Freightify, you can easily transform your digital platform as an efficient rate management system which can reduce your time for generating an inquiry from 15 minutes to 15 seconds, with greater transparency and speed for both your team and the customers.

With digitalization, not only does time efficiency increase notably, but the error ratio also drops significantly.Â

End-to-End visibility - real-time tracking

Track and Trace vessels by Getting their Latest Milestone Location - Freightify

Digitalization does not make back-office operations more efficient but also allows a flexible reaction of disruption within the supply chain.Â

In this context, real-time tracking helps to understand possible delays and therefore to plan accurate ETAs, which can be given to customers.Â

This results in happy customers and also reduces customer service call-ins from unsatisfied clients due to delays.Â

Another important advantage of end-to-end visibility is dynamic routing.Â Through permanent data sharing, it is possible to avoid upcoming delays through route optimization. This saves time in case of disruptions like a maritime bottleneck due to port congestion or blank sailing.Â

Receiving constant updates of the route and the ETA, shippers, and forwarders can re-route the shipment to ensure on-time delivery and customer satisfaction.Â

The promising chances of interoperability through digitalization

Digitalization helps companies not only to streamline data flowing through their operations but also gain data-based insights that can help with improving efficiencies.Â

But becoming digital as a company can do much more than that. Digitalization and data usage is the precondition to a global interoperability system between the different stakeholders.Â

Interoperability means the active exchange of data between different parties.Â This interaction would take the logistics industry and operations to a new, more transparent, efficient, and sustainable level. It would allow true end-to-end visibility and capture efficiencies that were never tapped before due to the absence of interoperable systems.

Interoperability is still a vision of the future because it is only possible if stakeholders follow data standards to ensure cross-company data interaction.Â

However, the business transformation to a digital system is the first step into a brighter future with new opportunities.

The Internet of Things (IoT)

An important requirement for end-to-end visibility within the supply chain is to have IoT devices at nodal points across the value chain.Â

These devices help the company to enable real-time tracking of their containers, measure the temperature and humidity to ensure quality standards of sensitive goods, and be able to comprehend any problem or disruption in the shipping process.



IoT devices collect data that help optimize processes and improve efficiency and costs and push them to the cloud.Â

With 4G LTE-based sensors, data transmission is faster, data latency is less and insights are more in âreal-time'.Â The development shows how fast technologies evolve.Â For instance, 4G is going to be the new status quo as 3G will shut down by 2022.Â

This stresses the importance of the adaption of digital systems in the future.

Digitalization as a basic requirement for Blockchain

Blockchain is one of the greatest developments in the digital age.

It offers companies an end-to-end solution for more efficient operations. It is a decentralized public ledger system that allows for community ownership of data, with the records being immutable without explicit approval from all the stakeholders within the network.

For the maritime industry, this would mean more visibility into the network and helping eliminate unnecessary intermediaries from within the supply chain. It can reduce bottlenecks and clerical order, while smart contracts would increase transparency.



To leverage blockchain technology, digitalization is key. Coupled with big data and artificial intelligence, blockchain can bring extraordinary gains in the context of supply chain interoperability.

Business optimization through data analytics

Most logistics stakeholders would agree to the benefits of storing data arising from operations. However, data is often just siloed without any purpose or use. Data is only useful when it is used.

For making data utilitarian, it is critical to ensure the collected data is streamlined - for instance, data should be digitized to be accessible.

This access is not only for all team members but also for different software that analyzes data and helps optimize internal and external processes. The right data usage would impact the workflows within the company, improve operations, and create the foundation of the implementation of blockchain and interoperability.

Optimization of Internal Operations

The logistics industry, and especially the maritime industry, rely on complex operations between numerous stakeholders. The need for fast and on-time delivery forces companies to adapt their often outdated business operations to the digital era.Â

Companies are often lacking inefficient back-office operations and visibility within the company. Teams don't have the needed transparency to operate in a fast and efficient way. The cutthroat competition within the market of logistics providers is increasing the pressure for all involved companies to optimize time, costs, and operations. The maritime bottlenecks due to the pandemic are especially hard to cope with for companies that donât have enough cohesion within their operations.

Time and cost efficiency through data comparison - quoting

One of the greatest achievements of digitalization is the time and cost-efficiency for the company using the new technology. Back-office operations can be automated and monitored with the same software and be accessible from any place in the world for all team members.Â

One advantage for the inside operations of the company is that data is available for all members of all the departments in the organization.

Aside from making data ubiquitously available across the organization, redundant processes such as sending or receiving documents - like invoices and bills of lading - can be automated.

Human resources can be used in a much more efficient way while administrative operations run automatically in the back.Â

White-labeled solutions like that of Freightify, guarantees you the best rates in real-time and increases your time efficiency by almost 450 times - reducing your quoting time to less than 30 seconds instead of 4 hours!

Customer satisfaction

Since the advent of Amazon within e-commerce, customer expectations have reached a completely new level. End-to-end visibility through real-time tracking lets customers be part of a new consumer experience.

Tracking the product and knowing where the order is at any time during its transit, is the new standard.

Furthermore, Amazon changed the industry with its incomparable flexible delivery options and efficiency to ramp up fulfillment to meet customer needs.Â

These rapidly evolving customer expectations have set the standard for a new, digitized industry where transparency and efficiency are key to prevail against competitors.

The retail industry is a customer-facing industry - their success crests and troughs with customer satisfaction. For a lasting and successful business, it is important to align operations with customer needs and goals.

As the retail consumer increasingly tilts towards the digital experience, digitalization within logistics becomes crucial for companies to sustain their position in the market and stay competitive in the future.

Conclusion

There are many reasons why digitalization became an integral part of a successful business. The main advantage is the efficiency gain.Â

Automating back-office operations enables companies to track and monitor complex business activities with relative ease. The increased time and cost efficiencies allow workers to focus the business and not on time-consuming paperwork or redundant tasks.

Digitalization also brings in data streamlining, optimizing internal and external operations, and ensuring they meet customer and business goals. In essence, digitalization is a helpful tool that gets the best out of the company and assures its lasting success.

What is Order Management? | Process & Cycle,https://www.zoho.com/inventory/guides/basic-guide-to-order-management.html,N/A,"Reading Time: 5 minutes

Every time you place an order with a store, there is a process that runs in the background until you finally receive your purchase. This process is called order management, which is basically keeping track of customers’ orders and handling the steps involved with fulfilling them. The process generally consists of accepting the order; picking, packing, and shipping the items mentioned in the order; and finally tracking them until they get delivered.

Read on to learn more about how order management works and how an efficient order management technique can help your business.

How does order management work: Order Management Process

Order management processes start right after a customer places their order and pays for it. The details of the order are sent to the store’s inventory, where warehouse workers manage the picking, packing, and shipping. The process ends with the store checking in with the customer to figure out if they were happy with their purchase. Here are the steps of a typical process.

Most order management processes can be broken down into 3 stages: receiving a customer’s order, fulfilling the order, and then handling the after-sales processes. Let’s see how each stage works in detail:

Stage 1 – Receiving the customer’s order

The first stage of any order management process begins when a customer places an order with your business. Receiving includes accepting the order from the customer and collecting payment for it. After this is done, the details of the purchase are forwarded to your warehouse so your staff can start working on getting the products ready for shipment.

Stage 2 – Fulfilling the customer’s order

In the second stage, you actually fulfill your customer’s order. This stage can be split into 3 different steps:

Step 1 – Picking

Fulfilling an order starts with the picking process, in which the items are retrieved from the warehouse. Warehouses are usually lined with shelves that are each stocked with different types of products, so warehouse workers need to be able to pick the right items for an order quickly and accurately. Once the items have been picked, they are sent to a packing station to be packed.

Step 2 – Packing

The packing station has more responsibilities than just packing items and sending them off for shipping. They are also in charge of using the right packaging materials for each product so that it reaches the customer intact and in good condition, while also using resources efficiently. For example, extremely fragile items like glassware need to be packed with bubble wrap or air pillows, and in a properly-sized box to avoid wasting packing material.

Step 3 – Shipping

After you’ve picked and packed the correct order, the next step is to ship it. The warehouse employees working at the shipping station typically take care of 3 tasks:

Attaching the applicable shipping label and invoice to the order Marking the order as shipped in all of your sales channels Sending out shipping confirmation and order tracking emails to the customer

Picking, packing, and shipping can only happen in that order if your business has the necessary products in stock. So what do you do when a customer places an order for a certain product, but you’re out of stock? In cases like this, businesses are left with two choices: they can either turn the customer away or postpone the order delivery to a later date using backordering or dropshipping.

For backordering, the business places a purchase order with their supplier for the product that is out of stock. The supplier will give the business a date when they will receive the new stock, and in turn the business gives their customer a tentative date to expect to receive their order. With dropshipping, the business forwards the customer’s order to the supplier, who delivers the product directly to the customer without sending it to the business first.

Stage 3 – Handling the post-sales processes

The last stage of order management is handling the after-sales processes. This is where businesses follow up with customers to receive feedback and make sure that they are satisfied with their purchase, and to manage any returns and refunds if they are not.

All three stages together make up a typical order management process. Some businesses like to customize their order management strategy to suit their needs better. Order management is also applicable for businesses that offer services instead of goods, although the process is slightly different. For instance, consider a mobile network provider. Instead of having to pick, pack, and ship products, a mobile network company has to receive each customer’s request to activate a network, and then set it up on the customer’s mobile phone.

What makes order management essential for businesses?

An organized and well-planned process for managing orders can do wonders for a business’ cashflow and inventory. It can save time and money, tell you whether the different parts of your company are working together well, and help you forecast the demand your business will receive. Let’s take a look at each of these reasons.

Since every order management process is itself made up of several individual processes that need to coordinate with each other from start to finish, it can help give you an idea of whether the different parts of your business are working together or not. This is important so that you keep your business running like clockwork and deliver orders quickly, accurately, and efficiently with minimal chances of error. Therefore, a streamlined process can be translated into higher customer satisfaction.

Another benefit of using an order management process is that it can help you learn to predict the level of demand you will receive. Predicting your demand will help you avoid overstocking and understocking, because you will know just how much of each product you’ll need to supply to your customers. This keeps you ready to sell your customers the products they want, when they want them. Since forecasting your demand gives you an outline of your business’ requirements and expenses, you can also use this information to chalk out a budget to follow. Over time, sticking to this budget will help your business’ cashflow too, so predicting your demand is good for your inventory, customer retention, and profitability.

Everything from accepting orders and keeping track of them to fulfilling them and taking care of the after-sales activity is part of an order management process. A proper order management technique that helps each process follow a fixed budget, keeps the inventory well-organized, and saves time and money should be at the top of every warehouse’s list of priorities. If you haven’t already, analyze your business and see if you can benefit from an order management process.",parcel tracking tech startups
Crypto-Agility Is Key For AI And Post-Quantum Tech Digital ...,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2024/06/10/as-ai-and-post-quantum-technologies-threaten-digital-trust-crypto-agility-is-essential/,3 дня назад,"Jason Sabin, CTO of DigiCert Inc. Passionate about digital trust, including digital certificate management for web, device & user identity.

Generative AI has come into its own, and early adopters are enthusiastically experimenting with the technology—creating a massive wave of audio, video, text and other content. As more people become comfortable with generative AI, its use is expected to continue to soar.

AI is revolutionizing business tasks, powering new levels of efficiency in knowledge work and innovative service models. However, according to Harvard Business Review, 79% of senior IT leaders reported concerns that generative AI brings potential security risks.

We're already seeing how generative AI can open up new opportunities for bad actors. Threats like AI deepfakes are showing up on social media, and they pose a serious threat in an election year. In today's fast-moving media landscape, a well-placed deepfake could have a major impact before it's debunked.

One thing is clear: AI threatens to compromise trust in our media and communications as well as key technologies and systems. To avoid the consequences, we need to start planning for action now.

Strengthening Security And Identity With Content Provenance

Establishing content provenance is key to identifying deepfakes and other deceptive AI content. Content provenance embeds identity into photographs, videos and other content ""at birth"" the instant it is generated or once the piece of content has Wi-Fi access. Any time the content is manipulated or edited, the changes are recorded—making identifying deepfakes and other altered content easier.

Companies like Meta and OpenAI began introducing metadata tagging to help better identify images and other content created with AI tools. Although this type of digital watermarking method can provide some assurance, it's not enough. To be effective, content provenance must be backed by cryptographically secure methods that embed identity into the content, sign it and certify its authenticity.

Although content provenance can help address the generative AI challenge, post-quantum cryptography (PQC) puts it at risk. Over the last two years, we've seen breakthroughs in quantum computing performance and accuracy. The Global Risk Institute (via Spiceworks) predicts these technologies will crack the leading cryptographic security schemes in use today by 2033.

Content provenance requires PQC in a post-quantum landscape. Organizations need to swap out their old crypto algorithms for new ones rapidly. During the transition period, they will be digitally signing twice—once with today's algorithms and again with the latest PQC algorithms.

It's important to note that PQC planning won't be limited to common assets like web certificates for most enterprises. Vulnerable code can reside in every aspect of business processes, and products and components span the entire supply chain. Cryptography may lurk in IoT devices, semiconductor chips, software and code signing, document signing and more. Organizations will also need to fully understand the security posture of OEM components that might be incorporated into their products.

Industry Leaders Coming Together To Make Progress

Top industry leaders are already taking steps to support improved content provenance. For example, the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA)—which DigiCert is a member of—is introducing a new ""icon of transparency"" mark to make it easier for consumers, creators and marketers to identify trusted digital content.

This standard uses public key infrastructure (PKI) to produce a tamper-evident record, helping users differentiate between real and fake media. Plans are underway for adoption by major brands like Adobe, Microsoft, Nikon and Leica. For example, a Nikon DSLR could digitally sign an image as it is created and then track and record any subsequent manipulation.

The new Supply Chain Integrity, Transparency and Trust (SCITT) standard is also coming into play. Under this system, images are tracked continually and updated on a general virtual ledger similar to a blockchain. Using a publicly accessible digital ledger enables anyone to look at and review the history of changes to any piece of content, providing transparency for everyone. The SCITT standard was originally devised for IoT and is now being adapted to track modifications to content.

To Prepare, Crypto-Agility Is Critical

How can you prepare to adapt to these transformative shifts in technology? An effective strategy should start with crypto-agility—which means having the ability to quickly switch out obsolete crypto assets without disrupting critical business processes and infrastructure operations. You'll need visibility into where you're using encryption such as certificates, algorithms, protocols and libraries. You'll also need to understand how these technologies have been deployed.

A Thorough Inventory Is Fundamental

Start with a complete inventory, identifying all of the cryptographic assets in use across your organization and their processes. Some elements such as web certificates and digital signatures will be easy to track. Others may be less obvious, hiding deep within your organization, products, services and third-party vendors.

As you evaluate all of your infrastructure, processes and devices, you need to track all documents, servers, users and devices that use cryptography. You'll also need to evaluate your DevOps processes to discover steps that require code signing.

Automate Crypto Management

Many organizations are already taking steps to prepare for the PQC era, implementing key encapsulation methods (KEM) and testing PQC digital signatures. Cloudflare expects NIST to finalize PQC standards in mid-2024, so it's important to start preparing for updates now by implementing automated management systems for your cryptographic assets. Scalability is especially important since massive re-signing will likely be required as new, post-quantum algorithms are issued.

Test To Prepare For Updates

Next, you'll need to thoroughly test your processes so you're ready to identify and remediate cryptography issues as they arise. For example, for a process like server-to-server communication, you need to have each server confirm that it can communicate with the other using a PQC algorithm.

Early Preparation Is Key

It’s clear that generative AI and PQC are wrapped together in their challenges and opportunities, and they will dramatically disrupt the way we ensure trust in digital communications. It's not too late to get proactive about cryptography. Start with the inventory and testing processes you have in place today, then expand them to include cryptographic assets. With the right approach and scalable, automated management solutions, you'll be fully prepared when these new technology waves arrive.

Samsung unveils chip technology road map to win AI ...,https://www.scmp.com/tech/big-tech/article/3266402/samsung-unveils-chip-technology-road-map-win-ai-business,12 часов назад,"Samsung’s share in the foundry market slid to 11 per cent in the first quarter of this year from 11.3 per cent in the previous quarter, while TSMC’s share climbed to 61.7 per cent from 61.2 per cent during the same period, according to TrendForce.

Though Samsung is the world’s No. 1 memory-chip maker, it has been trying to catch up with rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) in the foundry market, where companies manufacture customer-designed chips. Samsung laid out its chipmaking road map and outlined its vision for the AI era at its annual foundry forum Wednesday at its US chip headquarters in San Jose, California.

Samsung Electronics unveiled a number of forthcoming advancements to its technology aimed at luring makers of artificial intelligence (AI) chips to its manufacturing business.

The South Korean chipmaker’s earnings are recovering, helped by demand for components used in AI computing systems. That is bolstering its main memory chip division and also providing opportunities to win outsourcing orders.

But Samsung has to prove its production is advanced and reliable enough to attract bigger commitments from demanding customers such as Nvidia, which produces AI accelerators that are a must-have for all large technology companies. Samsung also faces a nascent challenge from Intel, which is opening its plants in an attempt to win orders from former rivals.

Advances in production technology, usually signified by smaller and smaller transistor dimensions, helps improve the performance of the electronic components. The race to smaller dimensions is key to winning orders for AI processors, some of the highest performing and most expensive chips in use.

The advanced process introduced by Samsung uses so-called backside power delivery network technology, which places power rails on the backside of a silicon wafer. Such technology enhances power, performance and area while significantly reducing the drop in voltage, compared with its first-generation 2-nanometre process, the company said.

Samsung also argues its ability to offer logic, memory and advanced packaging will help it make rapid progress in winning outsourced semiconductor manufacturing orders for AI-related chips.

The company predicted on Wednesday that its AI-related customer list will expand fivefold and revenue will increase by nine times over current levels by 2028. The company announced several new types of production technology and a layout for future AI-related chips that it said will help it win customers.

Samsung executives declined to comment on the status of its attempts to supply the latest advanced memory chips to Nvidia or respond to reports that it has not yet been able to achieve qualification of such chips at the US company.

Samsung also touted its gate-all-around – or GAA – technology, which is key for AI products. The company plans to mass produce its second-generation 3-nm process in the second half of this year and deliver GAA on its upcoming 2-nm process. In 2022, Samsung became the first in the industry to begin GAA-based 3-nm mass production.

The chip maker affirmed that its preparations for 1.4-nm are progressing smoothly, with performance and yield targets on track for mass production in 2027.",parcel tracking tech startups

Food delivery,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_delivery,N/A,"Courier service in which food is delivered to a customer

Deliveroo driver in Manchester, UK

Food delivery is a courier service in which a restaurant, store, or independent food-delivery company delivers food to a customer. An order is typically made either by telephone, through the supplier's website or mobile app, or through a third party food ordering service. The delivered items can include entrees, sides, drinks, desserts, or grocery items and are typically delivered in boxes or bags. The delivery person will normally drive a car, but in bigger cities where homes and restaurants are closer together, they may use bikes or motorized scooters.

Recently, online food delivery through third-party companies has become a growing industry and caused a ""delivery revolution.""[1] Nascent technologies, such as autonomous vehicles have also been used to complete deliveries.

Customers can, depending on the delivery company, choose to pay online or in person, with cash or card. A flat rate delivery fee is often charged with what the customer has bought. Sometimes no delivery fees are charged depending upon the situation.[2] Tips are often customary for food delivery service. Contactless delivery may also be an option.[3]

Other aspects of food delivery include catering and wholesale food service deliveries to restaurants, cafeterias, health care facilities, and caterers by foodservice distributors.

History [ edit ]

The first food delivery service was for naengmyeon (cold noodle) in Korea, recorded in 1768. Haejang-guk (hangover soup) was also delivered for the yangban in the 1800s. Advertisement for food delivery and catering also appeared in the newspaper in 1906.[4][5]

In 1962, an Edinburgh fish and chip shop started delivering fish suppers, chicken and hamburgers by car within the Edinburgh metropolitan area. The food was delivered in a stainless steel insulated pot to keep it warm.[6]

Types [ edit ]

Meal delivery [ edit ]

A meal delivery service sends customers fresh or frozen[7] prepared meals delivered to their home[8] or office,[9] perhaps in the form of cooked, individually pre-portioned meals. Meals may come in small tupperware containers and are often labeled with nutritional information. Some providers offer many options for specific diet types like vegetarian and vegan. These services often operate on a subscription business model rather than by individual order as in pizza delivery or with the broader category of online food ordering.

An alternative type of meal delivery service[10] is a meal kit, which distributes ingredients and recipes that customers prepare themselves.[11]

Meal delivery orders are typically on demand, intended to be eaten right away, and include hot, already-prepared food. While some service providers offer subscription services, ordering for delivery usually involves contacting a local restaurant or chain by telephone or online. Online ordering is available in many countries, where some stores offer online menus and ordering. Since 1995, companies such as Waiter.com have their own interfaces where customers order food from nearby restaurants that have partnered with the service. Meal delivery requires special technology and care, since the food items are already cooked and prepared, and can be easily damaged if dropped, tilted, or left out for long periods of time. Hotbags are often used to keep food warm. They are thermal bags, typically made of vinyl, nylon, or Cordura, that passively retain heat.[12]

In Mumbai, dabbawalas deliver hundreds of thousands of lunches (tiffin) to paying subscribers every workday through a system of rail and bicycle links. The lunches are sent in tiffin carriers, and are prepared in the late morning by either a restaurant or family member (typically a wife for a working husband, since many families still follow traditional asymmetrical gender roles). The tiffins are then returned either in the afternoon or the next day by the same system.

In the Philippines, most commonly delivered meals are from fast food chains like Jollibee, McDonald's, Pizza Hut, Shakey's, KFC, etc. Orders are being done through their delivery websites, mobile apps, or by phone. Time of delivery usually takes around 30 to 45 minutes.

In China, consumers mainly place food delivery orders via smartphone apps, with the number of users approaching 500 million people as of 2020.[13] The transaction scale of China's food delivery market is expected to eventually surpass US $129.17 billion, an increase of 14.8% year-on-year.[14]

Delivery of ingredients [ edit ]

Community-supported agriculture schemes work on a subscription box model, where a box of vegetables, dairy product, fish, or meat is delivered periodically from a local vendor.

Various meal kit delivery subscription services have started in Europe and North America since 2007. These typically have pre-measured ingredients designed for accompanying recipes.

Grocery delivery [ edit ]

Grocery delivery companies will deliver groceries, pre-prep or pre-made meals, and more to customers. The companies work with brick and mortar stores[15] or their own line of grocery items. These orders are typically larger and more expensive than normal meal deliveries, and are often not meant to be eaten right away, rather they are to replace items someone has run out of, like flour or milk. They are almost always done online, and typically take at least one day to deliver, though some companies offer same-day delivery. Many delivery services are required to offer delivery within two hours because frozen and fresh foods must be delivered before they spoil.

Grocery delivery differs greatly from meal delivery in the sense that it is usually sent as a parcel through common mailing services like USPS or FedEx, if it is only non-perishables. Since non-perishable items are normally packaged before arriving at grocery stores, they can easily be repackaged and delivered to customers without any special care. Sometimes, dry ice is added to keep perishable items fresh. Fresh and frozen foods complicate delivery which is done, usually by store/provider employees or third party services.

The grocery delivery business emerged, with hundreds of niche delivery companies springing up offering a variety of different services from weekly grocery restock to pre-planned, pre-measured family meals to simplify cooking. Online retailer giants have hopped on board too. Amazon.com, for example, offers AmazonFresh delivery service. Amazon purchased Whole Foods Market in 2017,[16] and by 2018 Amazon had added Whole Foods items to its Prime Now service, for 2-hour delivery in certain markets.[17]

According to Forbes,[18] grocery stores should deliver their own groceries to help prevent third party, part-time, non-store deliverers from becoming the 'face' or brand image of their local grocer. Limitations of having to pick and deliver groceries within a short period of time need to be remedied to allow for more flexibility to enable more deliveries to be more efficiently routed. Frozen and fresh food refrigeration units inside the store and the delivery vehicle, as well as lockable, consumer refrigeration boxes at the consumers home will be a solution that allows the groceries to be delivered at any time, further relieving delivery issues. This scenario will allow more local grocers to deliver with employees vs outside delivery services.

Associated fees [ edit ]

In addition to paying for the food, customers will often have to pay a delivery fee. The delivery fee will cover the cost of gas or other transportation costs, but usually does not go to the delivery person.[19] For meal delivery, it is common to give the deliverer an optional tip upon paying for the order.[citation needed] In Canada and the United States, tipping for delivery is customary. Opinions on appropriate amounts vary widely.[20] In addition, grocery stores may charge more for the foods that are ordered online for delivery than they charge for the same items off-the-shelf.

In restaurant delivery, if the delivery service is provided by a third party, such as Uber Eats or Deliveroo, the delivery fee, which can be as much as 25 or 30 percent of the value of the order, is paid by the restaurant to the service provider. In addition to the delivery fees, the service companies charge the restaurants a fee to set up the account, further cutting into the restaurants' margins.[21] Due to intense competition between the service providers wishing to sign up restaurants to use their services, restaurants have been able to negotiate lower delivery fees. McDonald's negotiated the delivery fees charged by Uber Eats from nearly 20 percent to ""around 15 percent,"" according to a report in The Wall Street Journal.[21]

In October 2020, Montgomery County, Maryland County Executive Marc Elrich announced that he and the Montgomery County Council (Maryland) were investigating the county’s ability to force lower fees charged to restaurants by food delivery apps.[22]

Service providers [ edit ]

In the United States, the first restaurant food delivery service in the world began in 1995 with World Wide Waiter[23][24] and still operates today as Waiter.com. The top three restaurant food delivery services are DoorDash,[25] GrubHub, and Uber Eats,[26] which together account for some 80 percent of the sector's revenue. The remainder is accounted for by smaller services.[27] From 2018 to 2021, global revenues for the online food delivery sector rose from $90 billion to $294 billion.[1]

In Canada, Canuck Eats, launched in 2020, specifically caters to smaller communities in Canada, beginning with Merritt, BC. It directly collaborates with local restaurants and drivers, offering a model that sidesteps the high fees and operational hurdles of larger competitors. Expanding into Nanaimo, Oshawa, and Edmonton through a franchise approach, Canuck Eats adapts to local needs while boosting regional economies and diversifying the Canadian food delivery landscape.[28]

In Europe, major restaurant delivery services include Deliveroo, Delivery Hero/Food Panda, Just Eat Takeaway, Uber Eats, and Wolt.

In South America, food delivery services include Uber Eats, DoorDash, Grubhub, DiDi, the dominant ride-hailing company in China, and Rappi, based in Colombia. Both Didi and Rappi are funded by SoftBank, the Japanese investment fund that is also a major investor in Uber.[29]

In China, food delivery services include Alibaba-acquired Ele.me and Tencent-backed Meituan. Users can order restaurant food, supermarket products, vegetables and fruit, cakes and flowers for delivery on these platforms.[30] China's food delivery market is expected to cross $21 billion in 2021.[31]

Some Japanese deliveries require recycling of food containers.

In India, the food delivery services include Zomato and Swiggy. Indian online food delivery is expected to become an $8 billion industry by 2020.[32]

In Africa, the food delivery services include Uber Eats currently operating in South Africa and Nairobi, Glovo currently available in Kenya,[33] Jumia Food currently operating in Kenya, Nigeria, Algeria, Ghana, Morocco, Tunisia, Ivory Coast, and Uganda, Mr D Food currently available in South Africa, OrderIn available in South Africa, Ayazona currently available in Nairobi, Delivery Yo currently available in Uganda and Yum Deliveries available in Kenya. Online food delivery in Africa is an emerging market that has seen a soaring growth in 2020 with new competitive market entries.[34] Online food delivery in Africa is slowly starting to take off, with multiple niche local delivery companies springing up offering a variety of different services ranging from food deliveries to groceries and house amenities delivery.

In Korea, the food delivery services include Baedal Minjok, Yogiyo, Uber Eats, and CoupangEats. Korea online food delivery industry is expected to reach $10 billion by 2020.[35]

In the Gulf Cooperation Council Region, after Uber Eats decided to close its operations in Middle Eastern markets, major food delivery services include now Careem Now, Deliveroo, Talabat and Noon Food since 2021.[36][37]

Software platforms [ edit ]

As the number of restaurant food delivery systems has increased, so have the logistical challenges of tracking online orders—restaurants using delivery services usually must have each service's tablet or iPad to receive orders, which then must be transferred into the restaurant's own point-of-sales system.[38] To streamline this, software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies have emerged to integrate the online ordering, billing and dispatching of restaurant food orders.[39][40] In addition to providing online ordering software for restaurant chains (e.g. Applebee’s, Cheesecake Factory, Chipotle, Shake Shack), these SaaS companies' digital platforms also provide data analysis that these restaurants use for medium- and long-term planning.[39][40] The application created for food delivery have positive influences on the performance and profits of the restaurant. Besides, it also can help to save money and time for both restaurant and customers.[41]

Moreover, COVID-19 has brought food delivery service to another level. The demand for online food delivery services increased significantly before the COVID-19 pandemic, which amounts to the US$31 billion.[42] Researcher Ahn also mentions that the revenue in the online food delivery segment increased from $76.195 billion in 2017 and aims to achieve $136.431 billion in 2022; the population of food delivery application users is expected to reach 965.8 million people by 2024.[43]

Working conditions [ edit ]

In May 2022, workers in two of the biggest GCC food-delivery service providers, Deliveroo and Talabat staged a mass walk out from their workplace in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. They demanded for better pay and working conditions through one of the rare industrial acts witnessed by the country. In the first walk out, the Deliveroo workers demanded better pay from their employers, while in the second strike foreign workers pushed Talabat to suspend their plans to cut pay by refusing to make deliveries in the emirate. The Gulf monarchy prohibits the formation of independent trade unions, industrial actions of the sort, and public protests. Reportedly, Talabat drivers in UAE received 3,500 dirhams ($953) per month, without the mention of the number of working hours involved, whereas, Deliveroo drivers earned $2.79 for each delivery made. Post petrol charges, the drivers for Talabat complained that they were left with a total monthly earning of 2,500 dirhams a month, after working seven days a week for about 12 to 14 hours a day. The drivers warned of continuing protests until their demands were met. The UAE authorities remained unavailable for immediate comments. The human rights groups have criticized the emirate and other Gulf nations for committing labor abuse by paying low wages to the migrant workers.[44]

Gnosis Freight employs low-code/no-code development tools to provide container visibility information for shippers. The context for this particular case includes the U.S. supply chains that are still reeling from the impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. Shipping costs have sky-rocketed with shippers facing huge uncertainties as shipments are marooned on container ships or in container port yards. Accustomed to reliable pick-up and delivery forecasts at reasonable rates, supply chains find themselves burdened with unreliable delivery forecasts or the inability to track shipments. Gnosis Freight, by combining data from several sources, provides logistics and transportation managers with near real-time information on their shipments. Gnosis solutions engineers, armed with low-code and no-code development tools, are able to quickly install customer-tailored container visibility portals with little adverse effects on the customer’s existing work processes and data flows. The implementation speed of these edge development tools provides Gnosis Freight with a strategic advantage over competitive offerings that require major changes in a customer’s supply chain operations. But the company also faces issues with its own data supplier, giving students a specific ""make vs buy"" problem to analyze.",cargo visibility solutions
The Impact of Data Visibility in the Supply Chain,https://witrac.io/en/recursos/the-impact-of-data-visibility-in-the-supply-chain/,N/A,"The Impact of Data Visibility in the Supply Chain

One of the conflicts today is in knowing the information at the moment that allows agile and effective decisions to be made.

The supply chain is characterized by its complexity in the management of each of its stages involving the production of raw materials, manufacturing, distribution and final delivery to the consumer. Each point in the network is focused on a market that demands quality, agility in processes and lower prices. So what is the key to achieving visibility, efficiency and profitability in supply chain management?

The pandemic has had a major impact on the supply chain, resulting in the modification and transformation of many of its core processes due to disruptions, delays, complete fleet losses and uncertainty.

Supply Chain Challenges 2022

In the past, the coordination and synchronization of the entities was sufficient to fulfill the entire route on time; however, today, interruptions and unforeseen events are increasingly constant, which has generated a volatile scenario of global logistics after the pandemic of COVID-19, the delicate situation with Russia and Ukraine, as well as the closures of China, a manufacturer of key raw materials for many sectors. Large global retailers, companies and consumers are the most affected. This whole situation is triggering stock problems, price rises and dissatisfaction among the participants in the chain who are struggling to meet the needs of demand.

The dependence of the markets that circulate goods between Europe, Southeast Asia and India with China, South Korea and the United States has been clearly visible, leaving important economic traces, breakage in the value chain and price increases in fuel, energy, gas, raw materials and labor.

The domino effect has already impacted fleets, causing traffic diversions and, consequently, slowing down the commercial flow of products, including oversaturation of warehouses with undelivered products and inventory conflicts.

According to a survey published by the Aberdeen Group, 19% of manufacturers and distributors report delays in decision-making due to a lack of accurate information.

Finding the problem could involve the investment of at least 500 man-hours due to lack of documentation and siloed data, leading to further delays and cost overruns.

The need to redesign alternative flows that enable immediate information and real-time monitoring to enable shipment flexibility would open up new possibilities in the ability to store and manage inventory and help find new ways to reduce costs while controlling deliveries.

Visibility in the supply chain and logistics

This is where end-to-end supply chain visibility tools are needed. More than ERP, full value chain visibility allows managers to take control of what happens to their assets.

Real-time visibility tools minimize the risk of bottlenecks, increase the likelihood of improved quality and clarity of service, and ensure that the distribution of goods and assets remains in optimal condition.

According to Gartner, by 2023, more than 50% of leading companies will have invested in real-time transportation visibility solutions.

Benefits of real-time visibility for the supply chain

Working with a complete supply chain visibility tool helps to detect incidents, stock-outs, delays and delay cost overruns, as well as to predict any failures that may occur in order to solve problems with greater accuracy and agility.

Helps to reduce costs, avoids expenses due to delays and late deliveries.

Enables location control and delivery fulfillment.

Enables reduction of CO2 emissions with route planning

Provides solutions for customer satisfaction with delivery on-time performance

Facilitates digitization of information and process automation

Encourages situation analysis and prediction with data provided by artificial intelligence

AIoT-powered technology is one of the most widely used technologies to achieve effectiveness because it allows organizations to get a much broader view of what is happening in real time and at any point in the supply chain.

Through the IoT infrastructure, powered with artificial intelligence algorithms, key elements can be managed such as:

Geolocation of assets, merchandise or transportation.

Monitoring the status of the goods by detecting humidity, temperature, machinery pressure level, voltage, among many other variables.

Alert of failures, breakdowns, losses or deviations.

Detection and traceability at points of interest

Route prediction

Control and visibility of the supply chain ecosystem

One of the current conflicts is to know the information at the moment that allows agile and effective decision making. That is why the generation of data provided by IoT, combined with Artificial Intelligence, becomes a powerful tool that facilitates the process of capturing and processing data to convert it into relevant information.

At WITRAC we help organizations and companies to control the entire supply chain with real-time data management and visualization from a single no-code platform.

Supply Chain Optimization | 7 Questions of Visibility,https://transportationinsight.com/resources/supply-chain-network-optimization/,N/A,,cargo visibility solutions
Visibility vs. Visualization: What's the difference?,https://blog.shippabo.com/supply-chain-visibility-vs-supply-chain-visualization,N/A,"Logistics professionals face countless challenges that can impact their supply chain. Most of the time, the reason for these mishaps is due to unclear, uncentralized visibility into data, insights, and communication.

Supply chain visualization solutions are helping to bridge the gap and give logistics teams the clarity needed for scenario planning and risk management.

But how do supply chain visualization solutions differ from all the supply chain visibility solutions in market?

In this article, we’ll explain why visibility data is only half the story regarding getting a complete picture of your supply chain and how supply chain visibility goes beyond data to deliver real-time insights that help you identify and anticipate problems.

Visibility Data is Only Half the Story



Many software products available to the logistics market provide importers with data about their shipments. They typically use a combination of GPS and map-based tracking data to give importers location information for their shipment, container and even a specific SKU.

This visibility data is used as a standard tool to give logistics managers an accurate snapshot of where their shipment is located and provides an approximate ETA, but it is typically available only to teams dedicated to managing the technical details of a shipment.

Without an end-to-end view of the entire supply chain, it's difficult to deliver high master-quality data that’s usable by all business teams. And without context, it is simply static information that the data logistics manager can use in the course of his or her analysis, but doesn’t deliver actionable insights.



Visualization and Decision Intelligence is the Other Half



Supply Chain Visualization software not only delivers an end-to-end view of the supply chain, but goes beyond data to deliver real-time insights that help you identify and anticipate problems.

These insights bring the clarity you need for scenario planning and risk management in the wider context of your supply chain; logistics, operations and finance teams can quickly make informed business decisions.

With this approach, your visualization solution does the heavy data-lifting and processing, so that you can free your logistics team from the labor-intensive work they often perform to manipulate and analyze often-scattered data. With a shared, single source of truth, teams can translate insights into action.



The Shippado Platform: Designed for Your Business



Shippabo delivers a unified platform based on a single, shared source of truth. Generated insights leverage historical and current real-time data to deliver a dynamic portrait of the shipment lifecycle as a whole, from milestone-level updates to product delivery - one that can be viewed in context by each team, and lets global teams work together based on a shared understanding.

By fully integrating mail-handling functions with our cargo operations and expertise, our innovative new mail solution provides a sophisticated suite of tools and facilities to support our postal partners.”

Cathay Cargo’s refreshed “mail as cargo” solution integrates mail-handling data with air cargo systems using the PAWB – the postal air waybill. This use of electronic data interchange (EDI) technology removes much of the previous shipment paperwork and gives both origin and destination post offices, and designated operators, more visibility of shipments down to mail bag (or “receptacle”) level, allowing them to offer package-level track-and-trace visibility to e-commerce shippers.

The information also enables Cathay Cargo to manage capacity against actual volumes of mail on flights, so it can make allowances for surges in ad hoc demand, or make unused space available for other cargo.

There is an additional benefit for mail heading to Europe where, by making the information available in advance, mail shipments will be compliant with the European Union’s new ICS2 customs requirements, which are being introduced this year.

Thanks to the digital data available from the PAWB, it is now easier not only to reconcile shipments for billing, but also to measure performance. Cathay Cargo will be adding KPIs to its mail performance monitoring suite, which is accessible on the EzyPost platform. Indices such as on-time delivery and visibility performance will be accessible and updated from live data.

Cathay Cargo will aim to outperform the 95% industry “visibility performance” standard, and will set its own stretch targets to ensure it exceeds contractual standards. The EzyPost platform will also produce monthly reports that will be available to post office customers. This accessible and more accurate data will simplify the measurement of contractual performance.

Cathay Mail also enables efficient operational recovery should an aircraft be grounded at an intermediate stop. Staff will be able to identify and segregate express mail shipments for priority uplift, and this will be visible in the system.

“This new investment in our mail-handling capability increases the attractiveness of Hong Kong as a global mail hub, giving post offices the confidence to move mail more seamlessly to, from and through Hong Kong,” added Owen.

In the India market, Cathay Cargo offers the Cathay Mail solution to India Post. Cathay Cargo helps India Post to convert CARDIT messages into a PAWB to create an online booking in CX-Cargospot, which is completely automated. The partnership offers high engagement and coordination between the two organizations to deliver the best service standards, timely uplift, smooth transit transfers, and on-time delivery with high real-time transportation visibility.

“During the pandemic, we collaborated with India Post to provide uninterrupted connectivity, uplifting mail bags from Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, and Kolkata. Currently, we serve around 14 destinations on our network. Our commitment to delivering exceptional service has resulted in strong growth in tonnage and revenue. Through Cathay Mail, we look forward to expanding our partnership and serve more destinations in the future,” said Rajesh Menon, Regional Head of Cargo – South Asia, Middle East & Africa.

Supplementary information

How the PAWB and EDI work

Ordinarily, airlines have little visibility of mail shipments. Mail is prepared in sealed bags at origin postal terminals and delivered to air cargo terminals for loading. Airlines are given conveyance instructions via a CARDIT (CARrier/Documents International Transport advice) message, and in return they send a RESDIT (RESponse to Documents International Transport advice) to acknowledge receipt.

Cathay Mail uses electronic data interchange (EDI) technology to integrate this limited messaging into Cathay Cargo’s own system. Now when a post office customer issues a CARDIT, Cathay Cargo will issue a PAWB (postal air waybill). This gives post offices visibility of the bags in each CARDIT and, therefore, the location of individual packages in each bag on their own systems.

Ongoing updates to the devices and apps that scan mail bags have delivered increased visibility and efficiency since the programme began. Bags can now “nest” in a Unit Load Device (ULD), which simplifies the scanning process and boosts efficiency. When the ULD is scanned, it captures the check-in status of the shipment and makes handling the shipment for onward flights or delivery more straightforward.",cargo visibility solutions

Demand of Supply Chain Visibility in 2024,https://www.qodenext.com/blog/supply-chain-visibility-2/,N/A,"Companies need to track and monitor their products, materials and information as they ,ove through supply chains. That is supply chain visibility. This includes sourcing of the raw materials till the final product reaches the consumer.

This entire process encompasses the gathering and analysing of real-time data and information. They are all of the movement, status, and location of the foods and the processes and actions that occur in production and transportation.

Need for Visibility in Supply Chains

Achieving visibility in the supply chain means having a clear and accurate understanding of the entire supply chain network. This helps organisations to make informed decisions, optimise their operations, and respond effectively to disruption or any demand changes.

This allows the companies to have more control and transparency over the supply chain. It leads to improved efficiency, reduced costs, enhanced customer service and increased supply chain performance.

Achieving real-time supply chain visibility offers companies a host of benefits. However, implementing it also means quite a few challenges.

But is this visibility important? Let’s see.

Why is Supply Chain Visibility So Important

When you have end-to-end visibility on your supply chain network, every time there is a blockage or something goes wrong, you can easily identify and resolve the issue. You can address the unforeseen problems and offer a certain level of flexibility.

Due to the complexity of supply chains, companies may face a major issue. That is the ability to access relevant information in one place in a format that facilitates easy understanding. You can have true clarity only when each person in the organisation is involved in the supply chain and has access to the same information.

Companies are always asking the question, “How to increase supply chain visibility?”

They must start by implementing robust tracking technologies like RFID or IoT sensors to monitor goods in transit.

Integrate data from suppliers, logistics partners and manufacturers into a central system for real-time insights.

Companies can also use advanced analytics to identify patterns, optimise inventory levels and predict disruptions.

Encourage collaboration among stakeholders and invest in cloud-based platforms for seamless communication.

The key is to continuously adapt to the systems to meet the evolving demands and have effective risk mitigation. All these technologies have benefits for companies.

Supply Chain Visibility Benefits

Here are a few of the advantages that organisations have when their supply chains practise transparency and visibility:

1. Enhancing Operational Efficiency

Visible supply chains offer real-time insights into their inventory transportation and production operations. This can help companies to optimise operations and streamline workflows. Such measures reduce inefficiencies.

They can identify bottlenecks. This may help businesses to enhance their operational efficiency and ensure more effective delivery of products or services. This ultimately boosts their profitability.

2. Improving Risk Management

Disruptions in supply chains can occur due to various factors. From natural disasters to political instability or even supplier issues- any of these can significantly impact businesses.

With visibility in supply chains, companies can proactively identify any risks. They may develop contingency plans in case of such risks and disruptions. This aids in mitigating such disruptions, and also saving time and money, minimising downtime and most importantly maintaining customer satisfaction.

3. Cultivating Trust and Transparency

Supply chain visibility software bridges the gap between businesses and their customers. This fosters transparency and trust.

As they give real-time information on order status, delivery dates and product availability, businesses can keep the customers updated. It helps them to effectively manage expectations.

Such transparency is what builds trust and makes the customer experience better. It leads to better satisfaction.

As you know, satisfied customers are more likely to become loyal partners of businesses and even recommend it to others. This is what drives revenue and sales growth.

Also, supply chains encourage collaboration and communication across the entire ecosystem. With real-time data, businesses work seamlessly with suppliers, manufacturers, retailers and distributors.

It strengthens relationships with partners and enables quick response to market changes.

Visibility in supply chains is a win-win situation- building trust with customers and optimising operations with the help of collaboration.

Companies opting for streamlined supply chains can enjoy all of these benefits. But they also have to adapt to the latest changes in the system. Why not see what they are?

Supply Chain Visibility Trends

Here are a few waves of changes that are already starting to change the way the global supply chain functions.

1. Rise of Data Aggregators

A problem that the industry will face in the next few years is the rise of data aggregators. These types of software will collect data from various sources. Then with the help of new algorithms, it will help logistic experts with contingency resolving their daily decision-making.

Some of these could feature predictive data that AI generates to improve the customer’s knowledge regarding the estimated time of arrival of the package.

The aggregation process gets integrated and mixes information from all sources, cross-checking it against various communication systems.

If a specific vessel does not depart on its scheduled timeline, aggregators will send alerts to the users. This allows time for any change of plans.

The aggregation process will seamlessly integrate data from vessels, cross-referencing it with weather updates, communication systems, and more.

Should a vessel deviate from its schedule, aggregators will promptly notify users, enabling timely adjustments for optimal visibility.

Collaboration between software firms and logistics providers will emerge, aiming to harmonise knowledge, expertise, and operational efficiency. This synergy promises to deliver superior visibility solutions, setting new standards within the industry.

2. Increased Outsourcing

As per Allied Market Research, the valuation of the global fourth-party logistics market was $ 57.9 billion in 2021. It has a projection of $111.71 billion in 2031 with a CAGr of 6.7% from 2022 to 2031.

This is a clear sign that more companies will move to logistics outsourcing. They want to leave their logistics in the hands of experts. Amongst these initiatives, there are one- 4PL models, where visibility is at the centre.

Supply chains are becoming increasingly complex and must improve to better navigate their intricacies.

The preferred approach to tackle future complexities and unforeseen obstacles will be through a “control room” model, shaping the future of visibility solutions.

3. Logistics as a Strategy

In the coming years, there will be a change in the mentality of supply chains. This will also change the importance of visibility. Logistics will emerge as a strategic asset for companies. It is going to generate an advantage in sectors like financial performance, customer experience and ESG deliverables.

Companies will increasingly view their supply chain as a vital component of their overall business strategy, moving beyond the domain of logistics teams. Instead, it will be integrated into the company’s strategic framework, optimised, designed, and adjusted to drive revenue growth, facilitate expansion, and fortify resilience against market fluctuations.

4. Rising Tech Pressure

E-commerce and its rising relevance along with omnichannel logistics will prompt closer inbound management of raw materials. The companies can extend their visibility to such parts of supply chains.

This connection will prevent any production shortages and ensure the availability of raw materials. Supply chain visibility tools like AI will also extend the visibility in this sector, making data public.

Current supply chain visibility and risk management techs use artificial intelligence and real-time data collection. This helps them to forecast any anomalies and prevent bottlenecks and losses.

FAQs: Demand for Supply Chain Visibility in 2024

What does the future of supply chain 2025 look like?

By the next few years, players in the supply chains may shift gears towards regional and local buyers and suppliers. This will reduce global supply chain bottlenecks, providing economy and profit to the locals.

What are the latest AI techs in the supply chain?

Machine learning is a prominent one that learns machine algorithms and applies them to, assess operational data feeds. This helps to predict supply chain disruptions.

What is a supply chain visibility example?

Visibility means tracking the product’s journey from when it is raw materials to production progress and distribution in real-time.

Conclusion

Supply chain visibility is enhancing transparency and real-time access to data. This helps organisations to optimise their processes, reduce costs, mitigate risks and improve customer satisfaction.

Selecting the appropriate software for your supply chain operations is crucial. It can effectively support your visibility initiatives. Seeking advice from experts in supply chain management, such as Qodenext, ensures that your supply chain runs smoothly without any hiccups.",cargo visibility solutions
ITCO publishes “best practice guideline for overseas ...,https://bulk-distributor.com/2023/07/itco-publishes-best-practice-guideline-for-overseas-transport-visibility-for-bulk-liquids/,N/A,"ITCO has published a new guidance document focusing on the topic of shipment tracking and automated milestone messaging.

The guideline has been developed and produced with the assistance and support of the European Chemical Transport Association.

The goal of this guideline is to define a standard definition framework with transport milestone events and ETx updates within a chemical multimodal door-to-door product movement.

Once such milestone events are predefined and agreed amongst each of the supply chain actors, and a standard offering is achieved, the challenging and time-consuming discussions which arise from creating tailor-made milestone information frameworks for each customer – or for each individual trade lane – may be avoided.

The aim is to create an “ITCO Standard” for supply chain milestones occurring from start to finish of an overseas shipment, which can be offered to every customer as the market norm. Such a framework is an important precursor before companies start deploying individual telematics and truck/equipment tracking solutions and it forms the basis towards transport visibility, interoperability and real-time information exchange across all logistics actors in the chemical supply chain.

Why complete supply chain visibility is essential for e- ...,https://sprintlogistics.com/why-complete-supply-chain-visibility-is-essential-for-e-commerce-retailers/,N/A,"A key part of effective supply chain management (SCM) is ensuring total visibility across your supply chain. Clear supply chain visibility empowers manufacturers, wholesalers and distributors to streamline processes, reduce costs and eradicate any inefficiencies, wherever they may appear.

Modern businesses rely on extensive and often multi-layered networks of suppliers, trading partners and customers, resulting in complex supply chains incorporating vast amounts of information from a range of sources. In an omnichannel world, supply chains are no longer a linear process. Effectively managing your networks, and therefore visibility, is essential for replacing inventory.

With many organisations reporting as little as 20% visibility into their supply chains, it’s no surprise that 84% of Chief Supply Chain Officers identify supply chain visibility as their biggest hurdle (Sana-Commerce).

Supply chain visibility and e-commerce

For e-commerce retailers, effective supply chain management is crucial. Optimising processes, from improving communications with manufacturers to forecasting demand levels, can impact your entire e-commerce strategy. A well-managed supply chain and clear, accurate data enables you to offer your customers a better service (through improved transparency and contact) whilst also cutting costs for your business and boosting revenue.

Visibility is more important than ever for your customers; today’s online shoppers want reliable updates and tracking services that allow them a clear view of delivery stages, transit method and the condition of their product, with the option to amend and alter their delivery as required. Providing these services is guaranteed to build customer trust and ensure shoppers return to your store again and again.

How to overcome the barriers to global shipment visibility,https://www.orkestrascs.com/blogs/5-tips-to-overcome-barriers-to-supply-chain-and-shipment-visibility,N/A,"Many supply chain leaders still consider supply chain visibility as a buzz phrase and donât understand how supply chain visibility works. Traditional methods of executing and managing global logistics and supply chains have inherent limitations, and the business of supply chain has been traditionally dependent on manual processes involving spreadsheets or legacy systems such as ERP systems which are riddled with these limitations. Currently, a shocking 6% of supply chains have full visibility into their supply chains, with a whopping 88% experiencing shipping issues. Companies cannot achieve end-to-end visibility of their shipments and supply chain with such limitations as it is impossible to track and trace the various activities involved with manual processes and an outdated, disconnected system landscape.

While this harsh reality has plagued supply chain leaders for decades, it has also highlighted the need for radical change that lies ahead to achieve forward growth in the future. While it may seem like an impossible task, shipment visibility isnât as out of reach as you may think. Studies find that 40% of supply chain leaders plan to invest in real-time supply chain visibility, with that number steadily rising. Supply chain leaders are putting measures in place to increase their shipment visibility today, and those who stay on the same tired path will surely be left behind.

What is supply chain and shipment visibility?

Shipment Visibility allows for a compressive view into a shipmentâs lifecycle, from manufacturer to consumer. Shipment visibility encompasses three main buckets: port to port, port to door and door to door. Whether at the raw material stage, production stage orâ¯shipment executionâ¯stage, visibility allows supply chain leaders and their teams a complete picture of the global flow of goods and all of its moving parts. Running a global supply chain with full shipment visibility helps companies collate invaluable data relating to consumer demand and patterns, remove redundancies, and improve the efficiency of all supply chain processes.

What are the benefits of shipment visibility?

Shipment visibilityâ¯is vital in ensuring robust supply chain operations. As we know, we cannot improve what we canât see, and shipment visibility proves just that. Whether itâs port to port, port to door or other modes of shipment, you as a supply chain leader must ensure a firm grip on operations at all stages of the process. Weâve outlined below the three main benefits of supply chain visibility when implemented correctly and to its fullest potential.

Cost-effectiveness isâ¯one of the major benefits of real-time supply chain visibility, as it allows the company to identify the flow of goods and have a clear view of the location of each order. This allows a reduction in stock levels, inventory costs, operational costs, as well as insight into the entire lifecycle of the product. Having supply chain visibility can ultimately result in a higher ROI for the company.

The provision of exceptionalâ¯customer experienceâ¯has become critical toâ¯achieving customer satisfaction in supply chains. Customers expect faster, more reliable, and better services. This can be achieved only through using modern technologies providing full visibility into all your global shipments.

Supply chain visibility can help in mitigating the many risks that supply chain operations face, including cargo theft, misplaced or lost inventory, and shortage of inventory. Through predictiveâ¯data analytics that most modern technologies offer, companies can identify risks before it poses a serious threat to the business and take corrective measures if required.

Barriers to shipment visibility

With all the knowledge of how vital supply chain visibility is to organizations, why are there still barriers to achieving it? Many supply chain leaders find themselves stuck in outdated mindsets and outdated systems. Whether this be out of comfort or fear of change, it stops their supply chain from realizing its true potential and results in increased cost, inefficiencies, and roadblocks.

Lack of understanding of what kind of shipment visibility is needed. When looking at your supply chain, you must identify what kind of shipment visibility is lacking so you know the next steps to take to achieve complete visibility. Identify between the following options you need in your specific supply chain:

Port to port. Port to port visibility is the journey a shipment takes from the port of dissension to its destination. Along the path, many things can go wrong. Shipments filled with tons of goods are left at sea for months on end, damaged, and sometimes fall off the shipment vessel completely due to turbulent weather/ conditions. Disruptions and roadblocks are inevitable, making visibility into this process essential. Port to door. Port to door visibility refers the process of transporting a shipment from its destination port to the consumers door. This process sounds easy enough; you may be picturing a truck parked and ready for a cargo boat to unload your specific container neatly and have it delivered to the end customer within a matter of hours. Door to door. In door to door visibility, your shipment is essentially travelling on one mode of transport throughout its journey. While door to door visibility generally leaves less room for errors due to its nature, there are always possibilities for roadblocks.

Not understanding the return on investment. Despite popular belief, supply chain leaders realize extraordinary ROI after implementing increased visibility into their supply chain, as many of those money eating roadblocks are resolved by increased visibility. Whatâs more, most real-time supply chain visibility platforms do not require you to own, operate and maintain their own digital assets, but merely require access to the cloud-based platform provided by the service provider. A new reality of saving time knowing where shipments are at stages, having predictive ETA`s allowing you to act before issues arise, faster decision making based on real time data, and much more is immediately realized. Whatâs more, all parties within your global supply chain network are working on one platform, allowing for full transparency, making way for inefficiencies to be spotted very fast through performance visibility and corrected in a timely way.

Perception of the timeline of implementing shipment visibility. Many companies have been working under the assumption that implementing end-to-end visibility into their supply chains should happen all at once. However, creating visibility and digitizing processes of supply chains can be done in a phased manner where companies can choose the areas that they need to prioritise and move to the next phases based on the progress and success of the implemented phases. For example, while providing pure port-to-port shipment visibility should take no longer than a few weeks, door-to-door shipment visibility at SKU level with attached order level information may take slightly longer, as setting up data transfer between systems and setting business rules must be defined. Matters become more complex when you set up visibility in other areas like landed cost as it requires a lot of experience, both in logistics and in technology and data management. So, timelines will surely vary across each unique supply chain, as no single plan/ timeline will work for every situation.

Lack of integrated approach. A supply chain involves several stakeholders handling various functions such as procurement, production, packaging, execution, distribution, and last mile all of which require close and timely coordination to work seamlessly. If each of these vendors uses their own siloed systems, there will be serious problems in areas such as collaboration, cooperation, and communication. This siloed approach is a big barrier to supply chain and shipment visibility for many companies as their system is not integrated. With modern technologies like supply chain visibility platforms, this becomes much easier for companies since they have already built up an eco-system that is integrated and provide proven and user-friendly, easily understood dashboards.

As supply chain management becomes increasingly complex and interconnected, it is essential for businesses to be able to monitor and track their operations. To do this effectively, more companies are turning to chain visibility solutions. But what is chain visibility? In this article, we will explore this concept in detail, so that businesses can understand the importance of monitoring their supply chain operations in real-time. We’ll also look at the benefits of using these solutions, such as increased efficiency and cost savings. Read on to learn more about how your business could benefit from utilizing chain visibility.

What is the supply chain?

The supply chain is the network of organizations that are involved in the process of transforming raw materials into finished products. The supply chain includes everything from the suppliers of raw materials to the manufacturers who turn those materials into products, to the retailers who sell those products to consumers.

Chain visibility is the ability to see and track all of the links in the supply chain, from raw materials to finished products. This visibility is essential for managing the flow of goods and ensuring that products are manufactured and delivered on time. It also helps businesses identify potential problems with suppliers or manufacturers and make changes to their supply chains as needed.

What is chain visibility?

The term “chain visibility” has become increasingly popular in recent years, but what does it actually mean? In simple terms, chain visibility is the ability to track and trace items throughout the supply chain from start to finish. This includes understanding where an item is at any given time, who has handled it, and what condition it’s in.

It’s important to have visibility into your supply chain for a number of reasons. First, it allows you to identify potential bottlenecks and areas of improvement. Second, it gives you greater control over your inventory levels and can help you avoid stock-outs. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it helps ensure the quality of your products by allowing you to track them from start to finish.

There are a number of ways to achieve chain visibility, but the most common is through the use of technology like RFID tags and sensors. These tags can be affixed to products and then tracked using special software. This data can then be used to create detailed reports that give insights into the whereabouts and condition of products at any given time.

While chain visibility offers a number of benefits, there are also some challenges that need to be considered. One of the biggest challenges is ensuring that all stakeholders in the supply chain are using compatible systems and technologies. This can be difficult to achieve due to the disparate nature of many supply chains. Another challenge is maintaining accurate data throughout the process; if data isn’

How can chain visibility be used to improve the supply chain?

Chain visibility is the ability to track and trace the movement of goods throughout the supply chain from raw materials to end customers. This information can be used to improve the efficiency of the supply chain and identify areas where improvements can be made.

There are a number of benefits that can be gained from improved chain visibility, including:

– Reduced costs: By tracking and tracing the movement of goods, companies can identify areas where costs can be reduced. This could include reducing inventory levels, streamlining transport routes, or improving supplier relations.

– Improved customer service: Customers expect companies to be able to provide accurate information about the status of their orders. With better visibility of the supply chain, companies can provide more accurate delivery estimates and keep customers updated on any delays.

– Increased efficiency: By understanding where bottlenecks occur in the supply chain, companies can make changes to improve efficiency. This could involve changing supplier contracts, investing in new technology, or redesigning processes.

What are some benefits of using chain visibility?

Chain visibility is a pivotal part of effective supply chain management, providing real-time data and insight into every link of the supply chain from raw materials to end customers. By leveraging chain visibility solutions, businesses can:

– Optimize production schedules and inventories in near-real-time

– Respond quickly and effectively to disruptions

– Make more informed strategic decisions around the entire supply chain

– Improve customer satisfaction through greater transparency and collaboration

– Reduce costs associated with inventory management and product waste

How can chain visibility be implemented?

Chain visibility is the ability to track and trace items throughout the supply chain from point of origin to final destination. This is typically done using a combination of technology and process, such as RFID tags, GPS tracking, and/or barcodes.

There are many benefits of implementing chain visibility, such as improved product quality, better customer service, reduced inventory costs, and decreased theft and fraud. In order to realize these benefits, however, it is important to carefully consider the implementation strategy. Below are a few tips:

1. Define your goals and objectives. What do you hope to achieve by implementing chain visibility? Make sure everyone involved in the project is on the same page and has a clear understanding of the objectives.

2. Assess your current state. Where are you starting from? What technology and processes do you already have in place that can be leveraged? What gaps need to be addressed?

3. Develop a plan. Once you know where you’re going and where you’re starting from, it’s time to develop a plan for how to get there. This should include both short-term and long-term milestones as well as budget considerations.

4. Implement and test. Put your plan into action and test it out! Make sure to collect feedback along the way so you can fine-tune as necessary.

5. Go live! Once everything is up and running smoothly, it

Conclusion

Chain visibility is an important part of supply chain management, as it can help ensure the accuracy and timeliness of the data that is shared between companies. By leveraging technology such as blockchain and IoT solutions, businesses can gain insights into their operations on a much more granular level than ever before.

TOC Europe Day 2 sessions focused on the challenges and opportunities the energy transition and digitalisation bring to the market.

The second day of TOC Europe 2024 was bustling with activity, featuring sessions that delved into the energy transition in the maritime industry, digitalisation, and the increasing importance of AI and automation solutions in port and terminal operations.

Energy transition

Today’s discussions put a spotlight on the urgent need for the sector to adopt sustainable practices holistically. The primary drivers of decarbonisation in both the shipping and port sectors are regulatory pressures, customer demands, and pushes from charterers and financiers. However, numerous challenges remain, the primary ones being cost and return on investment.

Speaking at today’s session A Holistic Approach to Energy Transition, Leticia Astudillo of Drewry Maritime Advisors highlighted the essential role that terminals play in reporting emissions. She pointed out that while many global sustainability initiatives focus on ports or the portfolios of global terminal operators, they often overlook critical terminal-specific analysis.

As explained, quantitative analysis and reporting are minimal in Global Container Terminal Operator (GCTO) sustainability reports, where lack of clarity prevents effective comparison and tracking of progress.

Astudillo also underscored the importance of Just in Time (JIT) arrivals as a vital decarbonisation measure for ports and terminals. This strategy aims to optimise vessel arrival times, reducing idle periods and minimising fuel consumption, thereby contributing significantly to emission reductions. By improving scheduling and coordination, JIT can enhance operational efficiency and support broader energy transition goals.

The industry has made significant progress over the past couple of years when it comes to decarbonisation, according to Sahar Rashidbeigi of APM Terminals.

“The conversations have matured significantly over the past three years, moving from discussions about HVO and energy optimisation levers to electrification and equipment replacement, which remains the toughest nut to crack,” Rashidbeigi noted. She added that there has been an exponential advancement in battery technology outside the industry that the OEMs don’t seem to be leveraging, keeping price premiums very high.

This is where ZEPA (Zero Emission Port Alliance) comes in, one of its main goals being to make the untethered battery/electric container handling terminal affordable and accessible by 2030.

Digitalisation and the Role of AI

Digitalisation and the integration of AI were also major themes of the day. Today’s Digitalising Maritime Trade session explored how digital technologies are transforming port and terminal operations, with AI and automation solutions increasingly adopted to boost operational efficiency, cut costs, and improve safety. These technologies enable precise data analysis, predictive maintenance, and streamlined processes, fostering a smarter, more responsive logistics chain.

The session also pointed out the findings of a recent survey showing the current state of readiness for digitalisation and information submission across maritime supply chains, with 40% of respondents being unaware of this IMO resolution, 64% still using paper and 80% stating they do not have a suitable IT application on board that enables automatic – or semi-automatic – information flows between the parties.

During the session, Laura Bercan, Digital Portfolio Owner Visibility Products, APM Terminals announced the launch of APMT’s Value Chain Innovators Program (VIP), intended for the existing or future APMT’s Shipping Line Dashboard users.

Shipping Line Dashboard is a digital tool providing real-time visibility of berth operations 24/7, containing detailed information right down to moves per hour for individual cranes. VIP, an omni-channel visibility solution for shipping lines, is available as of today.

Lifting operations safety

This demo session featured how implementing RFID technology can enhance safety across the terminal, followed by a discussion exploring the milestones and pitfalls throughout this process.

Stephan Trauth, General Manager, Mi-Jack Europe, said that the proof of concept for the Eurogate terminal has been delayed and is soon to be finalised. It will have a centralised solution through a server, with crane data and GPS as the key technologies.

According to Trauth, the main challenge during the process was the limitation of the radio frequency with only 24 channels available, but this was solved by implementing the rules on the priorities.

Trauth noted that, although competing in the market, terminals cooperate in exchanging experiences on technologies.",cargo visibility solutions

Will AI change the future of fleet management?,https://www.redgps.com/en/blog/ai-fleet-management,N/A,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is based on the concept of creating intelligent systems that can process large amounts of data, recognize patterns, make decisions, and learn from experience. This technology is already being applied in a wide range of sectors and activities, from virtual assistants on mobile devices and recommendation systems in e-commerce platforms to autonomous vehicles, advanced medical diagnostics, and complex data analysis.

With the advent of AI, many industries are experiencing significant transformation. Some technologies that have gained popularity include chatbots, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT or Google's Bard, as well as image-generating AI like Midjourney or Abode's Firefly. In this blog, we wonder to what extent this technology will impact the fleet management industry in the near future.

The Theoretical Impact of AI on Fleet Management in the Future

While AI is disrupting various industries, it's relevant to ask, does this also happen in the fleet management industry? Will AI revolutionize the industry forever? We conducted a small investigation on this, and we found that the information regarding this is still very speculative.

To begin with, the concept of applied Artificial Intelligence is not yet clear, and neither are its limitations and possibilities. It's challenging to precisely verify that a technology effectively involves the use of AI. Some of the features mentioned in different media are promoted as something already present in our days, while others list them as something that the future holds. Some of the attributes attributed to AI in the field of fleet management are:

Advanced Connectivity: AI will provide asset management platforms with all the necessary data for monitoring and diagnosing each unit and the entire fleet with unprecedented precision, in addition to offering significant capabilities for remote diagnostics .





Automation and Autonomous Vehicles: Machine learning algorithms and AI decision-making capabilities will enable heavy vehicles to drive autonomously and perform tasks like loading and unloading of goods.



Advanced Planning: AI will enhance the ability to predict patterns and behaviors in fleet management, such as service demand and personnel needs. For example, it will keep a record of driving habits and estimate route times more efficiently. This will allow for more precise planning and efficient resource allocation .



Enhanced Customer Experience: AI will be used to personalize the user experience , providing services tailored to individual needs. For example, automatic passenger identification and recognition of preferences and behavior patterns will represent a wide range of possibilities for personalizing the onboard experience in terms of safety, assistance, entertainment, and comfort.





Demand Prediction: AI can analyze historical data and external variables to predict future demand for freight transportation services. This helps fleets plan more effectively and allocate resources according to projected demand, resulting in faster order processing, optimized inventory management, and reduced delivery times.



There is no doubt that technology is advancing faster and faster, but there are aspects that require a long process, and its adoption in various areas takes more time than initially thought. In some of these areas, its implementation may not be as necessary or may present more operational challenges than it solves.

Will AI Revolutionize Fleet Management?

We believe this scenario is still distant. While there are hardware solutions that integrate AI, such as dashcams with ADAS/DSM (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems/Driver Monitoring System) technology and facial recognition, applying this type of technology to other aspects is more challenging. At the platform level, data processed by AI from dashcams like these is received and recorded as an event, but AI breaking into other processes is challenging to predict.

While AI focused on fleet management is still in the distant future, there are intelligent algorithms that can optimize delivery routes and save time. Although these are not yet considered artificial intelligence, we could say they are one step closer than other technologies involved in a GPS tracking platform.

We deviate a bit from the current trend of claiming that the future has already arrived, and AI will change all aspects of our lives, at least in fleet management. We believe that making such statements lightly can be counterproductive. However, we are attentive to industry trends and welcome changes with enthusiasm but also caution and reflection.

Fleet Management System - Requirement | Features | Cost -,https://www.igismap.com/fleet-management-system/,N/A,"This blog post describes a detailed overview of fleet management system – Requirement, Time, Technology and functionality. All features of Fleet Management Systems are going to be provided in this post in details.

Fleet Management System:

Fleet Management System is the range of functions which allows transportation companies in business to minimize the risk related with the improving efficiency, proven return on investment, productivity in business and reducing the overall cost.

It is a modular based system that has been developed for the group of transportation or large companies using fleets/vehicles with the sole intention of operating the business in a timely manner and reliable way.

Fleet management includes a range of functions like tracking valuable assets; automate the fleet reports, Management of vehicles and security & control of the fleet.

We provide simple and versatile fleet management system which is backed up by mobile access and live support. We emancipate your fleet with the sharpest technology, outstanding features and 24 hr access.

Now you can have more time to achieve your destination then less time to worry about the fleet operations and route.

Requirement Gathering:

What do client requires? We have an absolute idea of our client’s needs for the Fleet Management System in their business, so here is a list of some main requirements we think that every client would want in their Fleet management system. Reduce fleet management time and cost Integrate fleet planning and execution Real time tracking of fleet which includes vehicle tracking, driver detail and asset details. Fleet scheduling management for on-time deliveries and customer service. Automation of fleet reports. Management of fleet/vehicle Maintenance Fleet utilization management All time fleet monitoring Route tracking Expense tracking Fleet analytics



Hardware requirements: Implementation of fleet management system would require hardware entities for Real time tracking of fleets and driver, which can be listed as: Mobile Phones (iOS/Android/Windows): Any Mobile phone with the driver with GPS enabled in it can be used for the real time tracking of the vehicle and the driver. This provides you the location access to any of the mobile or immobile fleet. GPS Device: Live GPS tracking devices are ideal for most vehicle tracking needs. With live GPS tracking systems in the fleet, you can have access to real-time data about vehicle location, use, driving speed and etc. This can be used to track driving habits, route vehicles more effectively, keep tabs on equipment that is at high risk of theft, and improve your dispatch processes.

You can use both of these for the combine and separate tracking of the fleet and the driver.



Software requirements: These are some software requirements for the implementation of the fleet management system: Server : We can use any server for this management system but we prefer these two servers to be precise that we will be working on: NGINX Server – Nginx is an open source web server which can handle a website with a huge amount of traffic. It is a high performance web server developed with an intention to handle websites with large number of users. Its speciality is that it can run on a minimal amount of resources and handle a large number of requests. Digital Ocean Server – Digital ocean server or ‘droplets’ is a cloud server which is designed to store and server massive amount of data while making it easy and cost effective. Digital ocean server use KVM as hyperviser and can be created in various sizes. It helps in build deploy and scale cloud application faster and more efficient We personally recommend to use Digital Ocean Server, as it is much faster, easy and cost efficient. Socket connection: One of the main software components of the Fleet management system is socket communication server. It is a central server component that communicates with the tracking units. Socket connection is capable of communicating with multiple clients units using multiple threads as it establishes TCP/IP socket connection with the remote hardware units. When the fleet GPS is connected, the server will authenticate the connection and proceed to receive information from the device. RabbitMQ: RabbitMQ is the most used open source message broker software. It originally implemented the Advance message Queuing Protocol, which we will be using in this system. If we add single entries from server multiple times in database it will lock itself. So for preventing that from happening we will use RabbitMQ, which stores a information until a receiving server connects and takes a message off the queue. The receiving server then processes the information in an appropriate manner. So we can insert bulk information in the database in particular time as we want. Database: We will be using any of these two databases for storing the data we collected from the tracking devices of the fleet: PostGIS/PostGreSQL MySQL Mapping Systems: This is the main software component of the Fleet management system. This whole system is dependent on the web mapping of the data or information that the GPS devices provide. For mapping the data we can use any of these two Mapping systems. Google Maps: Google Maps is the tool which is used to display geographical information on a map which is in a widely accepted standard format for digital maps. OSM (Open Street Map): OSM is the software that creates and distributes the open source graphic data of the world. OSM has no restriction of technical or legal type. It allows free access to its map images and underlying map data. Here we can show our tracking data in real time. Features: Managing vehicles: We will provide you all the information regarding the fleet/vehicles in the web portal’s dashboard like vehicles insurances details, vehicle renewable reminders and Maintenance/service reminders for vehicles etc. Our system provides automated reports for every penny you spent on the vehicle and each expense you are going to do in meantime. We provide vehicle orders bar where you can manage orders and get previous order details. GPS Tracking: The tracking unit collects the location information with the help of the GPS (Global Positioning System) device which we used in our system as hardware. Global Positioning System can be used for providing the route to the fleet. GPS formats collected information into the system–specific packet format and sends it to server via socket connection server. Global Positioning System tracking system uses the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) network. This network incorporates a range of satellites that use microwave signals that are transmitted to GPS devices to give information on location, vehicle speed, time and direction by which we can manage Real time tracking of fleet which includes vehicle tracking, driver detail and asset details and Fleet scheduling management for on-time deliveries and customer services. Speed tracking: Driving with excessive speed is one of the main factors in fatal road accidents. Driving at a safe speed can help save lives. Fleet managers have an interest in keeping their drivers on the road and out of the troubles, and they also want to ensure that their fleet is operating in an efficient and timely manner. Speed tracking and reporting is a principal feature in Fleet Management System. In terms of reporting, our systems will report all offences to base in real time (even have the capacity to set an SMS alert). Geofence: Geofence is described as the circular areas which are defined around a particular location. It is set by the client in Fleet Management system by able to define the radius of the area. The GPS location of the center of the circle and the radius define a Geo-fence. If a vehicles GPS location is within the Geofence, then they are in safe area and if any vehicle go outside the area of geofence the client is notified by a text or email alert and the event is recorded.

Automate the fleet report: We surely provide the automated report on each transaction or order. We provide automated report of the previous orders of fleet which you can check any time or download the file. Cost: Contact us at our mail or put a comment below to discuss the expected cost.

Finding the Best Fleet Asset Management

When you work with a fleet management company, you can outsource your fleet management duties to them. They'll have access to the latest software, including being able to lease out various types of equipment.

A lot of this equipment is mobile in nature, giving software a refreshing new spin. In some cases, this means using tools like dashcams and similar video technology to capture footage on the road, or your drivers.

This type of software often integrates with the other platforms being used back at your headquarters. Letting an outsourced fleet management team handle this means you don't have to worry about investing in these technologies right away.

You'll find this a better way to go if you're a startup electrician or plumbing business still trying to find your financial footing.

Mobile Apps for Fleet Management

Some of the best fleet management software is in mobile app form. Using these not only gives more power to you, but also your drivers to make their jobs easier.

As a form of telematics, your drivers can use apps to help find their way to their destinations faster through digital mapping. They can also use these apps to enter their activity logs. No more do they have to write those logs out on paper and turn them in when arriving back to your office.

On your end, using real-time tracking on these mobile apps enables you to keep track of driver behavior. Occasionally, you might experience a fleet driver who attempts to break the rules. The driver may even drive other routes they aren't supposed to.

Being able to scope this out is what makes fleet management so important. However, the type of software you use is going to matter. Working with your fleet management team enables you to use the best possible mobile apps available today.

Software for Tracking Mechanical Problems

When you work with a fleet management service, they'll work closely to help you find vehicles right for your business structure. Some vehicles have internal software to better track any emerging maintenance issues.

Leasing your trucks also give you the ability to use GPS software to help your drivers find the closest repair center while on the road.

Ultimately, lowering your total cost of operations should become a top priority. Thanks to the advancement of fleet management software, you can monitor everything from your gas mileage to vehicle tires, all in real-time.

"Benefits of IoT-enabled, Smart Fleet Management Systems",https://social-innovation.hitachi/en-us/think-ahead/transportation/rule-the-road/,N/A,"When fleet managers leverage IoT, they gain actionable fleet data such as location, driver, vehicle, route, traffic and weather information. This is real-time data, and when combined with masses of historic data, it becomes the fuel to drive predictive and highly prescriptive analytics. With this knowledge on board, fleet managers can save money while improving customer service by reducing fuel usage, reducing downtime, automating maintenance planning and improving safety – and better satisfying insurance requirements.

The best IoT fleet management solutions allow companies to blend both historical business data and real-time machine data. For example, a platform can pull vehicle sensor data such as engine temperature, speed and cargo weight, and combine it with data from contextual sources such as vehicle make and model, GPS location, and maintenance history. By then blending this data with enterprise data from the company’s enterprise resource planning (ERP) and repair management systems, and automating predictive analytics by using machine learning, the solution can deliver actionable insights in real time.

By connecting everything from the field to the back office, an IoT fleet management solution delivers five big benefits: new revenue; improved safety; actionable, real-time data; greater efficiency and sustainability; and new, improved customer experiences.",fleet management software innovations

Fleet Management Technology Improves Winter Driving ...,https://www.contractingbusiness.com/technology/fleet-management/article/20871164/fleet-management-technology-improves-winter-driving-safety-and-field-team-productivity,N/A,"The influx of “no heat” calls and the rise of replacement projects is a clear sign for residential and commercial HVAC contractors that winter is coming. During the winter, HVAC professionals contend with everything from frozen pipes and broken thermostats to clogged heater filters, all while traveling to and from jobs and facing potentially dangerous weather and road conditions along the way. For HVAC businesses, it can be a challenge to dispatch jobs, keep drivers safe and keep tabs on the vehicle health.

Ahead of the winter season, fleet management software can help provide managers with a platform to better assess their individual drivers’ strengths and weaknesses for more hands-on, tailored coaching.

This is where advanced fleet management software comes in. Complete with GPS tracking capabilities, fleet managers can use the technology to monitor their vehicles’ locations in near real time, initiate weather alerts to drivers and make sure that jobs are being completed as efficiently as possible – and it all starts with a plan. With that in mind, see below for three steps fleet managers can take to utilize fleet management software in order to properly prepare their fleet and drivers, and why the technology is worth the investment this winter season.

Step One: Prepare Vehicles

When unpredictable weather hits, the last thing managers should be worrying about is if their vehicles can endure the storm. While there’s no way for an HVAC fleet manager to completely control what happens on the road, GPS tracking technology can help bring them one step closer to a peace of mind with advanced predictive analytics.

GPS tracking technology goes above and beyond manual checks to brakes and tires, it also monitors fuel usage and mileage, which indicates how long a vehicle has been in service and provides alerts for when maintenance is needed. This not only helps boost productivity and time between vehicle maintenance check ups, but also provides fleet managers with increased visibility of individual maintenance issues before the winter season hits and gives them the opportunity to act accordingly.

Step Two: Prepare Drivers

While drivers should always be exhibiting safe driving practices, it is especially important in the winter when icy roads and snow can quickly affect road conditions. Ahead of the season, fleet management software can help provide managers with a platform to better assess their individual drivers’ strengths and weaknesses for more hands-on, tailored coaching. Utilizing the technology’s rich analytics, managers can monitor harsh braking, harsh acceleration, excessive speeding, speeding versus the posted speed limit, and seat belt utilization - all from their offices. Once the data is collected, the software helps determine how to assess an individual’s driving habits with a numerical scoring system, which will permit fleet managers to take extra steps to coach their drivers through unsafe driving behavior. Ultimately, this is helpful for fleet managers to be able to monitor how their contractors and technicians drive when they cannot have eyes on each vehicle, and for the drivers to be as prepared as possible as they face harsh road conditions.

Utilizing the technology’s rich analytics, managers can monitor harsh braking, harsh acceleration, excessive speeding, speeding versus the posted speed limit, and seat belt utilization - all from their offices.



Final Step: Become the Navigator

Today’s fleet manager wears many hats, from tracking job progress and dispatching teams for incoming orders, to scheduling maintenance of business vehicles, but when winter strikes, the job entails more responsibility. With ever-changing road conditions due to winter weather, HVAC contractors may not know what’s in store on the roads. Utilizing GPS tracking technology within fleet management software can provide fleet managers with the ability to play the important role of meteorologist along with their everyday role as navigator.

The technology contains the near-real time location information of all vehicles in their fleet overlaid in the software with traffic and weather condition information, providing a multitude of benefits. During a particularly bad storm, a fleet manager can quickly alert drivers to road conditions while they are on their way to or from a job. This data can also help provide visibility into which roads are plowed, and which ones to route away from with safety and productivity being top of mind.

Overall, companies and drivers who proactively take steps to practice safer driving will be better prepared to take on the winter months. Fleet management technology today can help you keep your contractors and fleets safe this cold-weather season, especially as winters become increasingly unpredictable, no matter the weather forecast.",fleet management software innovations

Smart Logistics and Freight Villages Initiative,https://database.centralbaltic.eu/project/52,N/A,"The main aim with the project “Smart Logistics and Freight Villages Initiative” (SmartLog) was to develop new Internet-of-things (IoT) solution based on block-chain technology, that would help logistics and transportation companies to improve and make their supply chains more efficient.

Companies from Sweden, Finland, Estonia and Latvia were involved in the project along two TEN-T corridors: North Sea – Baltic and Scandinavian – Mediterranean corridor.

In order to test the new IT solution, in total 648 companies were contacted, and thorough communication with detailed analyses was conducted in 151 companies. The aim was initially to gain input to the companies software development, understand and map their processes, get an understanding on the maturity level of hard- and software and their susceptibility to the new technology.

Detailed process maps and simulations were done in 48 companies.

Finally, the developed software was connected to the IT systems of 12 companies and real time data gathered and analysed.

Within the time of the project, not enough companies started to use the new technology in such extent that measuring of the real impact and decreased transportation time on clearly defined routes was allowed. An important reason is that small and medium sized companies lack trust in new technologies due to security and privacy concerns, and they have low maturity level of digitalization.

However, the modelling shows that the improved cargo handling system would decrease transportation time and can be used and measured in every route or corridor. The time reductions along the two targeted corridors, based on process simulations, made up 6.3% and based on data analyses 3.8%. Larger time reductions can be expected when employees get more accustomed to using the benefits of the new software solution.

The new product is now developed and tested, and with relatively little effort companies if interested can take it into use. It can be accessed via:

The rapid development of TX Logistik AG was accompanied by a greater number of service providers, customer locations and of pre- and on-carriages. The main challenge was the clear allocation of orders but also the coordination and monitoring of trucking companies and subcontractors. The consistent, digital integration of container trucking companies ensures an efficient data exchange in real-time, which in turn facilitates the planning for all users. An overview of all orders can be displayed in the catkin status monitor. Planners can use the Web UI to focus on exception management or connect their ERP systems to the catkin platform. Structured order processes allow trucking companies and subcontractors to go through their jobs step by step. The following challenges have been addressed: Modelling continuous workflows along the logistics chain, linking them and integrating service providers and human resources as “end points”, optionally also material resource (i.e. vehicles) . The high level objective was to digitise collaborative processes.

How can the Industrie 4.0 approach be described?

Catkin enables horizontal as well as vertical integration of all parties involved in supply chains. The platform supports any process structure and flexible partner networks. All parties involved are integrated by Web or App. Logistics software and planning systems can be connected easily to the catkin platform via Open API. Smart Devices can be connected as “end points” by the central Web API as well, receiving customized instruction and delivering measurement data to the process. The catkin smart logistics platform can be regarded n different operation scenarios as a CPS.

What could be achieved?

Nowadays, the entire planning of pre- and on-carriages is organized completely digital. Paper-based processes and mail traffic were replaced by sophisticated communication methods. catkin interlinks digitally TX and all transport service providers and covers the entire process. Complex order structures, between receiving the order and delivery, in the combined transport chain and mandatory feedback are mapped digitally to generate end-to-end visibility. Each trucker and subcontractor reports the current work progress back in real-time to the planner at TX Logistik. The planner benefits from the fact that he is able to focus on exception management.

In terms of figures this means: The error rate almost halved, planning efforts were reduced by 12% and simultaneously order processing times were reduced by 25%.

What measures have been taken to achieve the solution?

Transport orders and data from various sources such as forwarding software are synchronized with catkin and are directly visible on the internet platform. The planners at TX assign each order directly by a simple mouse-click to their transport service provider; the container truckers receive their orders in real-time and instruct their truck drivers via app.

Truck drivers receive orders on their smartphone via catkin app and are able to communicate the order status, to scan barcodes, to send pictures and much more directly via app. The recorded data such as GPS positions, progress status and working times are transmitted via mobile internet to the platform in real-time.

What can others learn from it?

Essentially, catkin provides the basis for seamless collaboration of service providers of any kind and size. Recognizing that teamwork divides the task and multiplies the success, catkin is taking the next step: Linking collaborative processes across companies – rapid, universal, flexible, digital – to enable smart logistics.",smart logistics platforms
Henan's Xinzheng to Build Asia's Biggest Smart Logistics ...,https://carrier.huawei.com/en/success-stories/Industries-5G/Logistics,N/A,"On April 7, 2019, Transfar Zhilian, the Department of Industry and Information Technology of Henan Province, China Telecom Henan, and Huawei Technologies signed the Agreement on Building a 5G-enabled Smart Logistics Park, in an effort to build Asia's biggest smart logistics town in Xinzheng.

Xinzheng, Henan province, is known as the birthplace of China's legendary hero the Yellow Emperor and the birthplace of Chinese civilization. The town is now trying to define itself in another way: by building a world-leading smart logistics town.

The smart logistics town is part of China's ""specialty town"" initiative where local governments are asked to identify what makes their area unique and create an overarching theme by combining industry, tourist attractions, and the local lifestyle. Xinzheng selected logistics. Positioned as the interface between manufacturers and consumers, logistics is a fast growing industry, benefiting from the rise of e-commerce and new retail.

The signing ceremony was attended by representatives from the four involved parties and witnessed by top officials from the Henan provincial government, as well as the general manager of China Telecom Henan.

This move will accelerate the application of 5G in the logistics industry, marking an important step in Henan's digitization and innovation initiatives.

Leveraging higher bandwidth provided by the 5G network, the Xinzheng Smart Logistics Town will deploy HD video surveillance, AR-enabled security robots, and unmanned forklifts. 5G enables better network quality and more efficient network traffic in the logistics park, as well as lower cost of use and cheaper maintenance on a simplified network architecture. The widespread use of 5G in the administration and security of the logistics park will ensure the park stands as a leading example of the benefits of 5G.

The logistics park will use China Telecom's eCloud services to digitize the logistics industry, using artificial intelligence and automation to sort goods more efficiently. Working with partners on joint innovation projects, the park seeks to position itself as the benchmark for China's new logistics, building lighthouse projects to be replicated.

While 4G has changed lives, 5G will transform the world. 5G will help spark the digital economy, enabling the rapid development of emerging industries, like connected cars, Industrial Internet, virtual reality, and mobile healthcare, creating new growth drivers worth trillions of yuan.

Leveraging the high speed, low latency, and high capacity provided by 5G, the park will serve as a demonstration of how 5G can be used in the logistics industry, as well as in smart industrial park management.

The park will be more than a simple logistics industry cluster. Combining a strong logistics industry and rapidly evolving technologies, the park will provide a wide range of services that help businesses grow and prosper, boost the local economy, and improve the region's competitiveness. In addition, the use of 5G will usher in a bright future for the smart logistics town and a new era for Xinzheng.",smart logistics platforms

How to develop smart logistics industrialization？-Hannover,https://cemat-asia.com/industrynews/shownews.php?lang=en&id=3274,N/A,"Focusing on the status quo of smart logistics development, first, the synergy of manufacturing logistics resources needs to be improved. Since the manufacturing industry involves many links such as raw material supply, procurement, inventory, production, sales, and distribution, the decentralized and modular approach to resource integration is not conducive to the overall efficiency of the supply chain. Second, there is huge room for innovation in the supply of logistics in the consumer industry. In view of the fact that the service tentacles of consumer logistics have penetrated into individual consumers, their personalized, customized and diversified features are prominent, which has high requirements for logistics supply innovation, and thus becomes an important force to promote supply-side reform.





With the mission of a strong logistics country and meeting the people's growing demand for logistics services, the industrialization of smart logistics needs to focus on improving the supply capacity of logistics services, promoting the scale drive of the logistics industry to drive innovation, strengthening industry standardization, data linking and platform. Integration.





Industry standardization. Based on the business characteristics of the actual operation of the logistics industry, the diversification of market entities and the characteristics of small, scattered and chaotic business lead to the lack of docking of internal standards and industry standards, and become the mode of restricting the upstream and downstream links of the industry chain, container transportation and multimodal transport. Innovative short board. The industrialization of smart logistics first needs to lay the foundation foundation for the definition, division and coding of the standardized modules of the logistics industry. According to the business types, the standards of the sub-sectors, special lines, express delivery, express delivery, and city distribution are started. Pattern normalization can be performed from one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, and the like. Through the promotion and continuous improvement of the industry's leading enterprise standards, the company has achieved the standard of industry development in dynamic adjustment.





Data linking. With the maturity of the Internet of Things, cloud computing, blockchain and big data technology, the “Internet of Everything” in the entire network of logistics will show an exponential growth momentum. The relevant report shows that the degree of dataization of the logistics industry in China is relatively good. Due to the difficulty in obtaining cross-border logistics data and the poor cooperation, the cross-border logistics completion rate index is only 13.5. Therefore, the intelligent logistics industrialization needs to fill in the shortcomings of data infrastructure construction, and through the collection of information on the basic state of the logistics infrastructure network, transportation tools, and transportation organization dynamics, it forms a smart logistics operation with dynamic perception, comprehensive coverage and interconnection. system. Open up data links between domestic and foreign logistics, promote the seamless connection between road logistics, aviation logistics and water logistics, and break the “information island” between enterprise data and industry data.





Platform integration. The shared logistics platform organically integrates service scenarios, logistics elements and business models. It is derived from the expansion of the crowdsourcing and sharing model in the logistics division and cooperation. With the advantage of deepening the user's edge, the industry chain resources integration and platform are forced by the user demand. The superposition effect of the economic model, and the transformation of the logistics business and the transformation of production and circulation will become a trend. The wisdom and materialization practice based on the subdivided business scenarios such as warehousing, transportation and distribution needs to rely on the power of the platform to promote the vertical integration of the upstream and downstream of the logistics industry chain and even the horizontal integration of the logistics industry with other industries, so that the space for the growth of smart logistics industrialization is fully released.





In general, as a systematic project, the industrialization of smart logistics needs to be based on industry standardization, data linkage as a necessary condition, platform integration as an effective path, and ultimately promote resource integration and efficiency improvement in the logistics industry.

A Definition Approach to Smart Logistics,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-85500-2_28,Автор: D Uckelmann,"Having the right product at the right time at the right place and in the right condition – these are the well-known requirements for logistics and transportation in general. But fulfilling these requirements is getting more and more complex in a dynamically changing logistic environment. There is a shift from traditional supply chains to open supply networks. Long-lasting business relationships are overrun by short-term business connections. The highly dynamic logistic markets and the advancing complexity of logistic networks require new methods, products and services. Aspects such as flexibility, adaptability and proactivity gain importance and can only be achieved by integration of new technologies. While problem initiated approaches usually only lead to minor improvements, technology driven approaches can evoke more radical changes. The technology driven approach that is used to define Smart Products and Smart Services is utilized and extended to define “Smart Logistics”.

[Stay on top of transportation news: Get TTNews in your inbox.]

FedEx Corp. plans to cut as many as 2,000 jobs in Europe, the latest move by the package delivery giant to streamline its global workforce and rein in costs.

The courier plans to remove and consolidate roles across its back-office and commercial operations, according to a statement June 12. The changes won’t impact customers or delivery service, FedEx said.

The plan will generate annual savings of up to $175 million beginning in fiscal 2027, FedEx said. The company anticipates pretax costs of as much as $375 million from severance and related expenses from the layoffs.

The moves, subject to country-level consultations, add to sweeping workforce reductions since FedEx revealed a plan last year to restructure its delivery networks and save billions in costs. The company in March of this year acknowledged that head count had shrunk by almost 22,000 jobs over the prior year through attrition and cuts.

FedEx ranks No. 2 on the Transport Topics Top 100 list of the largest for-hire carriers in North America.

FedEx shares were little changed as of 7:35 a.m. before regular trading in New York.

Gaw Capital Partners Forms Smart Logistics Properties JV ...,https://www.gawcapital.com/news/pressrelease/gaw-capital-partners-forms-smart-logistics-properties-jv-platform-with-manbang-group/,N/A,"October 23, 2020, Nanjing – Real estate private equity firm Gaw Capital Partners announced today that the firm, through a fund under its management, has reached an agreement with Manbang Group to form a smart logistics properties JV platform to innovate and develop smart logistics properties and facilities across China.

Manbang Group was the result of a merger of two leading domestic truck-matching platforms, Huochebang and Yunmanman, in 2017 and has become one of the top unicorn companies in the Chinese logistics industry. The group has committed to creating a one-stop logistics portal and full chain closed-loop service. It provides freight services to match truck drivers with shippers online through its mobile app platform, which has transformed and optimized the highly segmented Chinese market, realizing its strong dual-end scale and network benefits. Manbang Group has also extended its business services to finance, energy, insurance and truck sales, etc. Currently, Manbang Group has over 5 million certified cargo owners and 9 million certified truck drivers, contributing total GMV of over RMB 700 billion annually.

According to the management consulting firm McKinsey, the current Chinese logistics market accounts for about 20% of the industry globally. The firm expects that China will retain its position as the world’s largest road transportation market in the next five years. In 2019, the scale of truckload transportation amounted to RMB 3 trillion. As the largest truck-load matching platform, Manbang leverages its large client base, dominant position in the industry, strong government endorsement, big logistics data and direct access to tenants, which enables it to provide strong support and guarantees on site identification and subsequent operation management. Gaw Capital Partners will leverage its expertise in investment underwriting, financing and development management capabilities to support the development and expansion of the JV platform.

Humbert Pang, Managing Principal and Head of China for Gaw Capital Partners, said, “Gaw Capital Partners is honored to form a JV partnership with Manbang Group, a market leader in the logistics industry. The ongoing rise of the consumer class – helped by increasing disposable incomes, in addition to continued upgrades of telecommunication technology like 5G – are leading to a new wave of demand for logistics, not only in Tier 1 cities, but also in emerging cities in China. Given the long-term market inefficiencies and segmentation characteristics of China’s logistics industry, Manbang acts as an innovative pioneer that has built a data-backed ecosystem using artificial intelligence algorithm for comprehensive freight services that make the logistics industry more intelligent and efficient. The tech-supported smart logistics platform will further strengthen Gaw Capital’s competitiveness in China’s logistics market. The first project of the platform will be implemented and constructed in the near future.”

Zhang Hui, CEO of Manbang Group, said, “Manbang Group will rely on its own technological advantages to empower the JV platform to better serve the various demands of small- to medium-sized enterprises in the logistics industry. Manbang inspires to be a builder and pioneer of new logistics infrastructure, connecting more partners to build a unique ecosystem.”

Gaw Capital has over 15 years of experience investing in and turning around various mixed-use and commercial properties in Greater China, including Hong Kong. The firm successfully transformed and repositioned properties such as Pacific Century Place in Beijing, which has become an industry benchmark in refurbishment project. In recent years, the firm also purchased 29 local Hong Kong shopping malls from Link REIT through funds under management, which it intends to reposition and revitalize into attractive hubs of community life. Gaw Capital has also successfully developed a sizable logistics platform, and has proactively invested in new economy related sectors including IDC platforms, prop tech platforms such as Beike, medical tech platforms such as Tencent Trusted Doctors, as well as premium outlet malls such as Florentia Village and education-related platforms in recent years to help support the growth and management of these assets.

MRL chief executive officer (CEO) Datuk Seri Darwis Abdul Razak said upon ECRL’s operationalisation in January 2027, MRL has set its target objective to devise and provide efficient and reliable transportation solutions tailored to Perodua’s needs, potentially reducing logistics costs through a more efficient transportation system.

MRL is the project owner of the 665-kilometre (km) ECRL, which will traverse the East Coast states of Kelantan, Terengganu, and Pahang before linking the Klang Valley on the West Coast.

""ECRL will pioneer the transportation of Perodua vehicles by rail to the East Coast states of Kelantan, Terengganu, and Pahang, aligning with Perodua’s commitment to modernising its logistics through more efficient and green rail transportation,” he said in his speech following the MoU signing and exchange ceremony between Perodua and MRL.

The ceremony was witnessed by Minister of Transport Anthony Loke Siew Fook.

Perodua president and CEO Datuk Seri Zainal Abidin Ahmad said the company will capitalise on ECRL to transport its cars from its plant in Serendah, Selangor to the East Coast, Sabah, and Sarawak.

""We will start with Perodua cars and then move on to spare parts, which are mostly spare parts from Japan, and by utilising Kuantan Port, it is actually closer than Port Klang,” he added.

The ECRL rail alignment from Kota Bharu to Gombak Integrated Terminal is expected to be completed by December 2026 and operational by January 2027.

The rail network’s alignment between Gombak and Port Klang is scheduled for completion in December 2027, with full operations to commence from January 2028 onwards.

Previously, it was revealed that the construction cost of the ECRL project from Kota Baru to Port Klang along 665 km and 20 stations in Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang and Selangor remains at RM50.27 billion. - Bernama",smart logistics platforms

VIDEO: Pilotless eVTOL air-taxi completes test flight in ...,https://www.traffictechnologytoday.com/news/multimodal-systems/video-pilotless-evtol-air-taxi-completes-test-flight-in-mecca-ahead-of-hajj-pilgrimage.html,23 часа назад,"Saudi Arabia has successfully conducted its first air taxi trial in Mecca, setting the stage for deployment in the coming years and transforming Hajj transportation for pilgrims. The annual Hajj pilgrimage to the holy city, takes place Friday June 14 – Wednesday June 19, 2024.

Led by the General Authority of Civil Aviation (GACA), in collaboration with the Ministry of Transport and Logistics Services, the Ministry of Hajj, the Ministry of Interior, and Front End Limited Company, the trial featured an EHang EH216-S pilotless eVTOL aircraft.

Conducted in a low-risk area with protected airspace, this initiative is set to redefine the Hajj experience by enhancing mobility, reducing congestion, and promoting sustainability.

The EHang craft has been fully certified for use in China, making it the first such vehicle in the world to be theoretically ready for public services.

“This groundbreaking trial is a pivotal step towards a faster, more efficient, and sustainable Hajj travel. Saudi Arabia is leveraging pioneering technologies to empower pilgrims with a seamless and sustainable pilgrimage experience,” says His Excellency Saleh Al-Jasser, Minister of Transport and Logistics Services.

The trial provides invaluable insights and technical data to support GACA’s development of an Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) Roadmap, including a robust regulatory framework tailored to provide safe and sustainable air transport solutions for Hajj pilgrims. By significantly reducing travel and delivery times, air taxis can accelerate the mobility of pilgrims and goods and improve emergency medical services during Hajj. AAM solutions are projected to support tens of thousands of pilgrims and generate tens of millions in revenue by 2030.

“This Air Taxi Trial marks a major advancement in integrating Advanced Air Mobility solutions into Saudi Arabia’s aviation landscape. GACA is committed to enabling new safe and sustainable forms of air transport, elevating travel for pilgrims and passengers across Saudi Arabia,” says His Excellency Abdulaziz Al-Duailej, President of GACA. “This trial acts as a proof of concept for multiple use cases and contributes to the advancement of mobility solutions across the Kingdom.”

Saudi Arabia has invested hundreds of millions into AAM solutions to scale the sector, as the Saudi Aviation Strategy (SAS) transforms the Kingdom into the Middle East’s leading aviation hub by 2030. The strategy is unlocking more than $100 billion of investment, with passenger numbers growing by 26% in 2023 to 112 million.

As a faculty member, I am interested in learning how to make supply chains function more effectively in today’s global business community. Clearly, supply chains have been in existence since the first manufacturer discovered it was more effective to buy components and raw materials rather than make their own. Supply chains then expanded into distribution channels when manufacturers learned that independent intermediaries could often facilitate the movement of goods and services from their factories to the end users and ultimately consumers.

Now, supply chains are complex entities, and many of the analytical tools used in system optimization can be directly applied to improving the efficiency and functionality of the supply chain. This results in higher profits for supply chain members and lower total costs for end users and consumers. When done correctly, everyone in the economy comes out ahead.

The best way to describe my scholarship in this field is through an example of my research projects. By studying and then testing various procedures with a leading manufacturer of transport refrigeration equipment, I can illustrate how advanced process models are used to integrate the supply chain.

BackgroundThe company was concerned that poor inventory management processes, leading to inaccurate stock records, were adversely affecting bottom-line profits and customerservice levels. Inaccurate stock records resulted in stock-outs and lost sales or overstock and excess carrying costs. Failure to incorporate variability in procurement lead times also produced shortages that negatively affected customer service and satisfaction.

After examining the company’s processes, I proposed an integrated approach to improve customer service, reduce costs through improved inventory and operational management techniques, and address improvements in the overall supply chain rather than focus on individual business operations. The approaches outlined below involve adapting advanced process models to accurately address complex operational dynamics across the supply chain.

Moving from problem to solutionPreliminary analysis revealed that the source of inventory errors was primarily data entry. The manufacturer had no formal procedures to identify and correct these errors. By creating a parity checking procedure based on material conservation concepts, “out of range” entries could be immediately flagged and rechecked at the time of data entry, minimizing downstream effects of uncorrectederrors.

Adding an Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) network between the manufacturer and its suppliers allowed lot sizes and inventories to be reduced without affecting ordering costs and lead times. Orders that did not correspond to standards triggered automatic calculation of the penalties that would result from incorrectly placed orders.

Similarly, at the “downstream” end of the distribution channel, expensive and low demand items were serviced directly by the manufacturer, while other items were distributed through dealers. The existing division of the items was subjective. The company believed that dealers should keep shelf inventory for more items, but if an item was not profitable, dealers would not inventory it. I identified a process model that provides aneconomic rationale for subsidizing dealers for maintaining optimal levels of key items, thereby encouraging them to keep appropriate shelf inventories of those items. The subsidization is justified to increase market share and profitability.

As is typical in any parts inventory system, many items in inventory were fully interchangeable. No procedures existed to control the proliferation of parts. The valid point for controlling this proliferation was the design department. To help them minimize component proliferation, I devised a framework that uses a three-level decision-making hierarchy. Level one represented standardization of system modules; level two represented capacity decisions for a product line; and level three incorporated thermodynamic optimization for control systems to keep the system dynamically balanced in changing environments.

Key lessons learned: Serve your supply chain, not just operations Using the models and process originally developed for one manufacturer, a pilot study was carried out to improve planning and fulfillment process for a manufacturer of highpressure positive displacement plunger pumps. The study validates the holistic perspective of parts management described above.

Several findings are notable:• A synchronized system from source to consumption can significantly improve operations; however, systemwide changes require a cross-functional team focused on reducing waste and investment in inventory.• Traditional measures of manufacturing efficiency and utilization were compared to proposed measurements of throughput, investment in inventory and operating expense. Although traditional measures indicated profitability would decline, the new measures show improvement and increased profitability of 200 percent for this product line.• Improved capacity management is achieved by sharing information between suppliers and customers.• Finally, for all the world’s complex problems, there are simple answers, but they are often wrong.

By adapting widely used concepts in industrial engineering and management science, it is possible to transfer these practices to new venues, such as the growing field of supply chain management, to produce cost savings and service improvements that benefit all members of the supply chain.

We first identify the operational problem, then adapt and test the model that offers a solution, and then bring the results into the classroom. Companies benefit, students benefit and the academic community benefits from this development and exchange of knowledge.",integrated supply chain systems

Integrated supply chain management (ISCM) is the proactive and reactive coordination of all aspects of the supply chain—including suppliers, manufacturing, distribution, and customers—to create a seamless flow of goods and services from concept to customer.

The goal of ISCM is to optimize the entire supply chain by integrating planning, execution, and delivery into a single system. This allows businesses to respond quickly and efficiently to changes in customer demand while reducing inventory costs.

ISCM requires close collaboration between all members of the supply chain, from suppliers to customers. To be successful, businesses must have visibility into all aspects of the supply chain and be able to share information seamlessly between different departments and partners.

Technology plays a vital role in ISCM, as it enables businesses to collect data from across the supply chain and make real-time decisions based on that data. The use of technology can help businesses reduce costs, improve communication, and increase efficiency throughout the entire supply chain.",integrated supply chain systems

The architecture starts with individual supply chain participants and derives insights into the complex and abstract concept of green-field integration design. The paper presented a conceptual system for depicting the interactions between business and supply chain strategy engineering. The system examines the decisions made when engineering the business strategy, with regards to the supply chain design. The system derived with a new understanding of how strategies are integrated, and what are the implications for engineering successful strategies. The study revealed that supply chain design is not considered in great detail before architecting the business strategies. Thus, companies consequentially experience supply chain problems that are likely to be detrimental to the growth potentials. The paper also derived with the findings that proactive and pre-emptive involvement of supply chain participants in the strategy engineering process, would lead to a more robust strategic design.

This paper contributes to fill the gap between practitioners and researchers about the needs of both systems. This paper found that transportation and warehousing are two inherently linked systems. However, the current practice lacks substantial improvements in data collection and modeling of these systems. Future directions point towards the use of big data and the implementation of econometric concepts (i.e. choice models), together with a spatial understanding of the impact of warehousing locations (i.e. accessibility concept) in transport costs.

Abstract The Internet of things (IoT) is a next generation of Internet connected embedded ICT systems in a digital environment to seamlessly integrate supply chain and logistics processes. Integrating emerging IoT into the current ICT systems can be unique because of its intelligence, autonomous and pervasive applications. However, research on the IoT adoption in supply chain domain is scarce and acceptance of the IoT into the retail services in specific has been overly rhetoric. This study is drawn upon the organisational capability theory for developing an empirical model considering the effect of IoT capabilities on multiple dimensions of supply chain process integration, and in turn improves supply chain performance as well as organisational performance. Cross-sectional survey data from 227 Australian retail firms was analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results indicate that IoT capability has a positive and significant effect on internal, customer-, and supplier-related process integration that in turn positively affects supply chain performance and organisational performance. Theoretically, the study contributes to a body of knowledge that integrates information systems research into supply chain integration by establishing an empirical evidence of how IoT-enabled process integration can enhance the performance at both supply chain and organisational level. Practically, the results inform the managers of the likely investment on IoT that can lead to chain’s performance outcome.",integrated supply chain systems
Maximize Supply Chain Management Collaboration with an ...,https://www.soltius.co.id/blog/maximize-supply-chain-management-collaboration-with-an-integrated-system,N/A,"Supply Chain Management collaboration - This collaboration is divided into four, the first is collaboration transactions, the goal is to achieve more effective and efficient transactions. This type of collaboration does not require a long-term strategic understanding. The second is cooperative collaboration, which requires commitment between supply chains to share information on forecasting, inventory, procurement, delivery of goods, including production capacity.

The third is coordinated collaboration which requires a two-way flow of information and this planning and execution process is harmonious and between parties in the supply chain. The fourth is synchronized collaboration where the components in the supply chain work together in research and product development, various assets, capacities, performance, and so on.

Example of Collaboration

To be able to make this collaboration management work effectively, it is important for you to use the right and accurate collaboration Supply Chain Management software or system. By using the Supply Chain Management Collaboration system, it is easy for companies to ensure efficiency, determine goods and their quantity, besides that a good collaboration SCM will help you make better decisions and also respond to new opportunities faster to make you one step ahead in business competition. .

An example of this supply chain collaboration is a silica sand supplier being able to see an opportunity to integrate logistics or distribution processes with a limestone supply mill because of the same location. These two suppliers deliver their products to cement factories. With this collaboration, efficiency in terms of transportation costs and this strategy is called horizontal collaboration.

The level of collaboration does not stop there where cement factories want to be effective in determining demand and distribution systems so that inventory levels can be reduced. The factory began to integrate the system with its distributors. This is called advanced integration, which is to collaborate with parties in the next process to get closer to consumers.

To ensure the quantity and quality of this supply, cement factories buy a large part of the supply companies' shares in order to make it easier to integrate their production systems with the integration in the previous process. The integration of all entities in the supply chain system will reduce uncertainty in the amount of supply, make supply more timely, ensure quality and quantity of supply of goods.

SCM collaboration systems are also beneficial in terms of production. You can easily determine the demand, capacity planning and quality of each entity. This system will also facilitate distribution and transportation.

Disadvantages of Companies Without an SCM Collaboration System

When supply involves several parties, it is time for the company to implement a collaborative Supply Chain Management system. There will be many losses that can be obtained by companies that have not implemented this system where the first loss is from its operations.

When all the suppliers involved in the supply chain are not connected, delays in distribution operations can occur and there is no guarantee of quality and quantity of goods. This will make the company unable to satisfy customers so that it has an impact on the company's performance.

To achieve this goal, real-time supply chain systems decisions are needed to address the inherent production, operations, and market uncertainties. Machine failures impact the producers’ ability to meet their scheduled demand. Logistics delays are a significant source of uncertainty, especially when perishable items are transported with direct consequences on delivery time and quality. Real-time condition monitoring for in-transit perishable items requires an adequate infrastructure system available. Two relatively new technologies for the production and logistics domain, RFID and wireless sensor networks, provide the needed sensing, processing, and data storing and communication capabilities. When integrated, the resulting monitoring and control system may allow producers and logistics companies to considerably improve their operations by gaining more visibility for the product movement across their supply chains. This work proposes a framework for the design and implementation of a monitoring and control system for production and transportation operations.

The customer-oriented approach is actively developing within the global trend of the modern industrial revolution that is Industry 4.0. The focus on customer interests has led to cooperation and integration in supply chains, improving their efficiency and increasing transparency, awareness, and trust. However, an issue emerging in this scenario is that conventional supply chain management (SCM) procedures are unable to identify the potential proposal for a particular user. Modern businesses need to build integrated supply chains, which require well-developed infrastructure and easily available complementary services, relying on logistics as a networking technology. Supply chains of this generation grow from traditional individual desynchronized economic relations (linear models with some feedback and the simplest network configurations) to scalable, adaptable, harmonized partner networks. The logistics potential allows additional income by reducing the total costs of participants in the network, thus increasing the competitiveness of companies; this can be implemented based on new models of interaction in the current digital environment through, firstly, system integration. Our goal consists of identifying the essential characteristics of system integration and substantiating the methods for its implementation in the digital economy.

Abstract

The study investigated the effect of supply chain integration on the performance of supply chains.



Specifically, the study investigated the effect of information, operational and relational integration of supply chains and how they affect the overall performance of the supply chain. The study administered 1500 questionnaires to some selected supply chain and information systems specialists and based on the responses received, 400 questionnaires were fully completed and which was used in the analysis of the study.



Based on the findings, it was found that information and operation integration had a positive effect on supply chain performance whiles relational integration has a negative effect on supply chain performance. The result implies that within the Ghanaian context managers should invest more in information and operation integration in order to achieve positive outcomes in their supply chain whiles relationship integration should be done with more caution because of its underlying elements of trust and long-term commitments.",integrated supply chain systems
Lucent SCN : leveraging the fully integrated supply chain,https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/28519,Автор: DML Scholtz,"(cont.) in the success of Lucent's turnaround and, from the patterns that emerge, a basis for a new holistic framework for designing and leveraging an integrated supply chain is offered. This framework suggests that attaining competitive advantage from supply chain capabilities lies in a firm's ability to incorporate corporate culture, leadership style, organization structure and both inter and intra tier governance methods into it's supply chain design in order to enable an integrated and extended organization where the channel expert can be identified and engaged in decision making in a natural, real-time and organic process.Over the past three years, in response to dramatic changes in the telecommunications industry, Lucent Technologies has realigned its corporate strategy from being a provider of manufacturing excellence to one of supply chain excellence. Supported by this realignment, Lucent has recently returned to profitability after eleven consecutive losing quarters, and has posted dramatic improvements in financial, operational and customer satisfaction metrics. Lucent's new strategy is focused on leveraging its supply chain capabilities to create a new extended enterprise that is both customer and supplier intimate, and operates as a broad reaching cross-functional Supply Chain Networks (SCN) organization. Pivotal to the success of this realignment was extending the scope of Lucent's supply chain activities, both internally and externally to the company. Internally, Lucent integrated such non-traditional SCM activities as sales, product design, and margin management into its newly created SCN organization. Externally, by outsourcing virtually all of its manufacturing, and much of the associated supplier management, to Electronics Manufacturing Services (EMS) partners, Lucent became responsible for the orchestration of an extended multi-tier supply chain that integrated abilities and expertise of functional teams within Lucent and within its EMS partners, raw component suppliers and customers. In this thesis, the Supply Chain Networks transformation at Lucent is examined in the broader context of the changes that took place in Lucent's: organizational model; leadership team; corporate culture; customer and supplier relationships; operations; and market space. The change that was effected in each of these areas is reviewed for its role",integrated supply chain systems

Integrated Supply Chain Management | Principles of Marketing,https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-marketing-spring2016/chapter/reading-integrated-supply-chain-management/,N/A,"Learning Objectives Define integrated supply chain management

As the importance of managing the supply chain well has increased, companies have acknowledged that they must manage the supply chain as a complete system and treat it as an integrated function. When an organization takes an integrated approach, it is recognizing that it cannot manage each part of the supply chain as an independent function, but instead needs to understand and manage the connections and interdependencies.

Within the supply chain organization, this means that sourcing, demand planning, inventory planning, warehousing, logistics, and order-fulfillment functions must work together. The rise of supply chain software tools that bring this data and information together in one place is just one indicator of an increasingly integrated focus. Also, many organizations previously had these functions spread between different organizations with little opportunity to interact. Today, most large organizations have an integrated supply chain function with a common management team and common objectives.

Beyond the work occurring within the supply chain organization, there are important connections to marketing, finance, and manufacturing. Marketing plays a direct role in creating the demand forecast and defining the product and delivery expectations for customers. These must be reviewed with the supply chain team so that everyone knows what needs to be achieved, and when that isn’t possible, adjustments can be made and communicated to customers early. The integration with finance is necessary to ensure that investments are budgeted correctly and inventory is accounted for accurately. Manufacturing is often most heavily affected by decisions and requirements of the supply chain team, as they are counting on having an adequate supply and must meet delivery time lines to keep customer commitments.

As with many complex organizational challenges, this integration works best when there are clear objectives that are set across the organizations, a common view of the data (which identify opportunities for improved performance), and clear, frequent communication about potential issues and needs. This enables all of the organizations to focus on delivering value to customers and achieving the company mission.",integrated supply chain systems
Importance of Integrated Supply Chain Management | Quloi,https://quloi.com/mx/recursos/blog/importance-of-integrated-supply-chain-management/,N/A,"Horizontal integration

Horizontal Integration involves buying or cooperating horizontally with different parts of the supply chain, such as suppliers, manufacturers, and retailers. This integration allows for better stakeholder communication and streamlines the process by reducing operational redundancies. For example, a chocolate manufacturer can coordinate with packaging suppliers about upcoming orders or changes in demand so that they can adjust their production schedules accordingly. This ensures that the availability of packaging materials aligns with production requirements – minimizing delays and maintaining a continuous manufacturing flow.

Vertical Integration

Vertical integration in the supply chain involves the same product’s upstream (suppliers) and downstream (customers) activities. This integration allows companies to exert more control in the manufacturing and selling of their products and services. Let’s take an example of a successful tech giant and the biggest orchestrator, Apple, following a vertically integrated business model. The successful company controls a lot of elements in supply chain like software designing, marketing, etc. – resulting in user-friendly and visually appealing high-quality products.

Why Integrate Your Supply Chains?

According to a study by Ehtisham Ali et al. (2023), “integration practices are significantly associated with supply chain performance. The study featured that both external and internal integration influence supply chain performance and confirms the mediating role of organizational antecedents between integration practices and supply chain performance.” Whether you plan to expand vertically or horizontally, integrating your supply chain isn’t an option anymore to stay competitive in a globalized marketplace. Understanding ‘why integrate supply chains’ is important to ensure a supply chain company makes reliable choices in a high-stakes environment.

Integrated supply chains:

Facilitate faster product development and quicker time-to-market with fewer links in the supply chain.

Respond faster to market shifts and seize growth opportunities.

Minimize intermediaries and eliminate waste for cost-efficiency.",integrated supply chain systems
Why Manufacturers Should Embrace Supply Chain Integration ...,https://connectedmanufacturing.wbresearch.com/blog/why-manufacturers-embrace-supply-chain-integration-2023,N/A,"The global COVID-19 crisis had significant impacts on the global supply chains we rely on to move materials and completed products around the world. And, even though the worst days of the pandemic are now behind us, supply chain recovery has been slower than expected.

What’s more, subsequent geopolitical events such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the UK’s exit from the European Union (Brexit) have compounded these difficulties by adding extra complexity to any supply chain which has links in the affected countries.

This means 2023 is the year when manufacturers and all other stakeholders in these supply chains must seek to establish new practices and processes which will make them better able to operate in this increasingly challenging environment and more resilient in the face of future disruptive events.

Supply Chain Integration

The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine defines supply chain integration as, ""an association of customers and suppliers who, using management techniques, work together to optimize their collective performance in the creation, distribution, and support of an end product.”

Integrated supply chains bring all stakeholders together – raw materials procurement, product design, manufacturing, warehousing, and distribution – and synchronize their operations in a manner which promotes product traceability and communication. This promotes resilience as disruptions can be identified earlier meaning up-chain links can respond with agility and act on previously agreed upon contingencies.

Supply chain integration is typically achieved through the acquisition or merging of other companies, meaning that more of the supply chain is operating as a single entity, and/or the development of an increased number of business lines which act in various stage of the chain. These strategies are typically applied through one of two methods:

Horizontal integration: the acquisition or development of capabilities in the same link of the supply chain. An example of horizontal integration would be a car manufacturer that acquires a regional competitor to expand its market and have more control over prices.

the acquisition or development of capabilities in the same link of the supply chain. An example of horizontal integration would be a car manufacturer that acquires a regional competitor to expand its market and have more control over prices. Vertical integration: the acquisition or merger process involving several levels within the supply chain. In other words, vertical integration entails purchasing another business or developing in-house capabilities within the company to expand the scope of its services. For example, a manufacturer may merge with a logistics company which offers them greater insight into and control over what happens with products once they leave the factory.

Resilience and Robustness

2022 research published in the Journal of Global Operations and Strategic Sourcing examined the relationship between supply chain integration and firm performance during the COVID-19 crisis, and the mediating role of resilience and robustness.

The results of the research heavily suggested that supply chain integration is highly effective as an underlying mechanism which can facilitate the development of resilience and robustness as two dynamic capabilities during global crises such as the coronavirus pandemic.

""The results support the positive effect of three SCI dimensions of internal, product and process integration on operational and financial performance during the coronavirus pandemic,” report the research authors, Rosa Hendijani, and Mahdis Norouzi. ""Furthermore, internal and process integration have positive effects on resilience. Internal, product and process integration have positive effects on robustness. In addition, resilience mediates the effects of internal and product integration on both operational and financial performance, whereas robustness mediates the effect of internal and product integration on financial performance.”

Barriers

Supply chain integration is not without its challenges and there are several factors which can act as barriers to achieving it. A lack of IT solutions and knowledge, poor working relationships with other links in the chain, communication issues, prohibitive costs, conflicting goals, and difficulties achieving leadership buy-in can all contribute to difficulties achieving supply chain integration.

Of all of these, leadership buy-in may be the most critical. As we discussed in a previous article in this series, enthusiasm and resource availability for these kinds of initiatives tends to trickle down from the top – i.e., if your leaders are on board, everyone will be on board. Therefore, making the case to the c-suite should be your top priority.

""Building a superior supply chain within an organization requires all its stakeholders to work together efficiently,” writes GEP. ""Gone are the days when organizations had no choice but to rely on one-way communication and lag in handling supply chain operations. Businesses now must achieve supply chain integration where all parties are integrated into a single communication system.”

Final Thoughts

Supply chain integration is essential for those manufacturers which wish to be more resilient and robust in the face of future crises. It seems highly likely that more challenges are on the horizon for our industry, so acting now is far preferrable to a wait and see approach.

Supply chain integration is certain to be part of the conversation at Connected Manufacturing Forum 2023, being held in June at the Westin Buckhead Atlanta.

a) Customer service management process :

Customer service provides the source of customer information. It also provides the customer with real-time information on promising dates and product availability through interfaces with the company's production and distribution operations.



b) Procurement process :

Strategic plans are developed with suppliers to support the manufacturing flow management process and development of new products. In firms where operations extend globally, sourcing should be managed on a global basis. The desired outcome is a win-win relationship, where both parties benefit, and reduction times in the design cycle and product development is achieved. Also, the purchasing function develops rapid communication systems, such as electronic data interchange (EDI) and Internet linkages to transfer possible requirements more rapidly. Activities related to obtaining products and materials from outside suppliers. This requires performing resource planning, supply sourcing, negotiation, order placement, inbound transportation, storage and handling and quality assurance. Also, includes the responsibility to coordinate with suppliers in scheduling, supply continuity, hedging, and research to new sources or programmers. c) Product development and commercialization :

Here, customers and suppliers must be united into the product development process, thus to reduce time to market. As product life cycles shorten, the appropriate products must be developed and successfully launched in ever shorter time-schedules to remain competitive. According to Lambert and Cooper (2000), managers of the product development and commercialization process must :

1. coordinate with customer relationship management to identify customer-articulated needs;

2. select materials and suppliers in conjunction with procurement, and

3. develop production technology in manufacturing flow to manufacture and integrate into the best supply chain flow for the product / market combination.



d) Manufacturing flow management process :

The manufacturing process is produced and supplies products to the distribution channels based on past forecasts. Manufacturing processes must be flexible to respond to market changes, and must accommodate mass customization. Orders are processes operating on a just-in-time (JIT) basis in minimum lot sizes. Also, changes in the manufacturing flow process lead to shorter cycle times, meaning improved responsiveness and efficiency of demand to customers. Activities related to planning, scheduling and supporting manufacturing operations, such as work-in-process storage, handling, transportation, and time phasing of components, inventory at manufacturing sites and maximum flexibility in the coordination of geographic and final assemblies postponement of physical distribution operations.



e) Physical Distribution :

This concerns movement of a finished product/service to customers. In physical distribution, the customer is the final destination of a marketing channel, and the availability of the product/service is a vital part of each channel participant's marketing effort. It is also through the physical distribution process that the time and space of customer service become an integral part of marketing, thus it links a marketing channel with its customers (e.g. links manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers). f) Outsourcing/Partnerships :

This is not just outsourcing the procurement of materials and components, but also outsourcing of services that traditionally have been provided in-house. The logic of this trend is that the company will increasingly focus on those activities in the value chain where it has a distinctive advantage and everything else it will outsource. This movement has been particularly evident in logistics where the provision of transport, warehousing and inventory control is increasingly subcontracted to specialists or logistics partners. Also, to manage and control this network of partners and suppliers requires a blend of both central and local involvement. Hence, strategic decisions need to be taken centrally with the monitoring and control of supplier performance and day-to-day liaison with logistics partners being best managed at a local level.



g) Performance Measurement :

Experts found a strong relationship from the largest arcs of supplier and customer integration to market share and profitability. By taking advantage of supplier capabilities and emphasizing a long-term supply chain perspective in customer relationships can be both correlated with firm performance. As logistics competency becomes a more critical factor in creating and maintaining competitive advantage, logistics measurement becomes increasingly important because the difference between profitable and unprofitable operations becomes more narrow. A.T. Kearney Consultants (1985) noted that firms engaging in comprehensive performance measurement realized improvements in overall productivity. According to experts internal measures are generally collected and analyzed by the firm including :

1. Cost

2. Customer Service

3. Productivity measures

4. Asset measurement, and

5. Quality External performance measurement is examined through customer perception measures and ""best practice"" benchmarking, and includes :

Abstract It is increasingly being argued that in today’s competitive marketplace, an important way of securing strategic advantage for companies or original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) is the use of highly integrated supply chains. In such chains, the OEM, its key suppliers, and distributors operate as one integrated unit to effectively serve the customer. Integrated supply chains are expected to enhance productivity, lower costs, reduce response times, and lead to the development of superior new products. More and more OEMs are either already implementing or are planning to embrace such integrated Web-based Supply chains (Teach, 2002). The main responsibility for the creation of an integrated supply chain falls on OEMs. They decide which of their suppliers should become the primary or main partners in the chain and which will be secondary suppliers. The trend is to have few key suppliers for a particular part or material. Thus, suppliers who are included in the supply chain get a large share of the OEM’s business. However, OEMs, in turn, expect quite a bit from these suppliers by way of technological infrastructure, commitment, and identification with the supply chain. Generally such suppliers are expected to install sophisticated Web-based supply chain systems that are compatible with the OEM’s systems and provide open access to the OEM to their information systems, databases, drawings, and documents.

7 Building Partnerships | Surviving Supply Chain Integration,https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/6369/chapter/9,N/A,"want to look ahead, anticipate potential problems or hazards, and find ways to relieve these conditions by providing for them in the contract (or, more generally, in the overall supply chain relationship).

High levels of supply chain integration are more likely to be achieved with ""win/win"" contract approaches than with win-lose approaches. A long-term view is important for integrated supply chains in which the parties have a substantial bilateral stake in the relationship and contractual breakdowns can be costly. The typical intent of a partnership is to establish a relationship with increasing interdependency that will outlive the term of the contract. A farsighted view, although it may be difficult to implement, can increase benefits for all parties.

Contract as a Framework

Contracts consisting of rules and contracts that serve as an operating framework for a relationship are very different. Lawyers and accountants often relate to the former, whereas business is more often conducted in the spirit of the latter. Contracts that serve as frameworks for relationships are based on four key ideas: (1) the objective of the contract is to serve the goals and desires of the parties, rather than those of the lawyers; (2) contracts that attempt to define complex relationships are unavoidably incomplete; (3) give and take by all parties is necessary to work through gaps, errors, and unanticipated situations; and (4) informal and formal features of the contract and of the organization are all part of the exercise. This is not to say that the letter of the contract is unimportant. If, despite their best efforts, the parties are unable to work through a contractual impasse, the contract can be useful for purposes of ultimate appeal.

There is every reason, therefore, for contracts to be written and negotiated carefully, although this does not mean being legalistic. Because providing for every possible contingency is impossible, information disclosure and adaptive mechanisms must be included to assist the parties when difficulties arise and the formal terms of the contract take on added importance. Contracts are legal documents, after all, and relationships should be defined precisely in case the contract becomes the ultimate reference for resolving disputes. Mainly, however, contracts should be thought of as frameworks to aid the parties in realizing their collective purposes and mutual gains.

Neither party, especially not an SME, can unilaterally decide that a framework is the correct approach to define a supply chain relationship. Both parties must subscribe to the concept for it to be successful. If one party adopts a myopic, legalistic view and the other views the contract as a framework, both parties will be frustrated. It is important, therefore, that they agree on the nature of the relationship and recognize that each",integrated supply chain systems
"Supply Chain - Integration, Visibility and Collaboration",https://www.tpsynergy.com/supply-chain-integration-visibility-and-collaboration/%20,N/A,"Supply Chain Integration leads to Visibility and Visibility leads to Collaboration. Collaboration leads to success. Let us try to define each of these components and see how they play together in a supply chain.

Supply Chain Integration

Integration in a Supply chain is the process of bringing together People, Systems and Process into one common platform. Integration is the starting point in a collaborative supply chain. Let us consider the nodes in a supply chain. A supply chain has the typical nodes as below

Customer Customer

Supplier

Warehouses

Transportation Provider

Each of these nodes plays a key role in the supply chain. Each of these nodes also use their own system. For example, customers use their ERP to create orders and suppliers use their ERP to process the orders. These two systems should be talking to each other in real time to get the benefit of Integration. That is system to system integration. We also need people on the supply chain to be integrated on the process. For example, Buyer might be interested in expediting a specific order, but supplier may be prioritizing some other order. This needs to be integrated

Supply Chain Visibility

Visibility is the availability of information at the right level and the right time. In supply chain, visibility is needed in different areas as seen below

Order Visibility

What are the orders are open, what needs to be executed on priority, has suppliers received and confirmed the order, is the order on track? All these aspects are under order visibilit

Order Status Visibility

This is more applicable in the contract manufacturing scenario. As the order progresses through various stages like Design, Development, Manufacturing etc. Order status visibility is needed to the Buying organization.

Shipments Visibility

Shipments status visibility is to view what orders are currently being shipped, where are they in the transit now, when it will be expected to arrive.

Receipts Visibility

Receipts visibility is needed for the suppliers to ensure that the material they shipped has been received and accounted for. This will avoid future issues when the invoices are paid.

Quality Visibility

Quality visibility will tell the suppliers if there were any quality problems on the shipments. Were all the material they shipped got accepted. What were the quality issues on the shipments?

Demand Visibility

This is also the forecast visibility. What is the expected demand in the near future. These demands are not firm orders yet, but supply chain needs to have the visibility of what to expect.

Supply Chain Collaboration

A basketball team in action is a good example of collaboration. There is a clear signal from the player what he intends to do with the ball and the team members will know what to do to get the ball. In Supply chain also, this kind of collaboration is needed.

Each member in the Supply chain clearly communicates what they need from the other members of the chain. For example, the buyer clearly communicates what they need and when they need. Supplier communicates what they can do and when they will do. Once communicated, each member executes what they communicated. Suppliers deliver what they promised to deliver

Right Tool for the Right Job

Only a correct tool should be used for the correct job. It is not possible to achieve Integrated supply chain by using Email, Phone collaboration only. Companies need a true supply chain visibility and integration tool to achieve this. Supply chain collaboration portals like that of TPSynergy should be used to manage the Supply chain collaboration.",integrated supply chain systems

In this paper, an integrated supply chain framework is developed that considers three main dimensions of information: customer demand, transportation, and inventory data. These dynamic supply chain data are integrated in an algorithm capable of producing high-quality, minimal cost solutions for the integrated supply chain system. The integrated supply chain model's primary goal is to react effectively and quickly to supply chain disruptions and changes, thereby adding unique flexibility to current supply chain decision support systems. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested in a dynamic environment by embedding it in the decision-making framework of a supply chain simulation model. Model results demonstrate the algorithm's ability both to improve system performance and to reduce total supply chain costs.

Supply Chain Integration: Levels and Barriers - Fashinza,https://fashinza.com/supply-chain/management/supply-chain-integration-levels-barriers/,N/A,"Summary: As fashion brands move out of their locations to source materials and suppliers and sell their products, supply chain integration has become essential to make such a vast network of resources productive and effective. But it is not an easy task given the many hurdles. Here are the different barriers and the levels in supply chain integration .

Supply Chain Integration is a complex amalgamation of business processes with automated communication channels. For large-scale clothing manufacturers, especially for those with a large number of partners and sourcing locations, supply chain integration is inevitable. Setting it up effectively requires a lot of effort on the part of different parties spread over a vast and diverse geographical spread. This integration, therefore, runs into barriers that need to be removed and tackled.

To avoid unnecessary time and effort, different levels of supply chain integration streamline the internal processes and help in their alignment with those of the stakeholders in the supply chain. Before we take a look at the different levels and barriers in implementation, let us find out what supply chain integration is.

What is supply chain integration?

Supply chain management is a multi-layered process. To be effective, you need to have multiple departments from various departments working in close cooperation like cogs synced in a perfect alignment. Supply chain management makes sure that all departments in a business are working together in perfect harmony.

Supply chain integration is about making an organization's supply chain more effective and efficient with cross-functional communication and monitoring channels. It is about making sure that the supply chain aligns with the business strategy and can allow modification in procurement and shipping in real-time to optimize business operations for better ROI.

Levels of supply chain integration and what they entail

Primarily, supply chain integration has three different levels. These three levels subsume the other phases critical to integration.

Strategic: Supply chain integration is a managerial call. As a policy-level decision, it would necessarily involve business management. This is where the outline for the integration gets ready. The business managers have to decide on the scale of integration based on the cost it would incur. They will consider market trends, customer preferences, and moves by the competition to design their integration process. This involves long-term planning and resource allocation.

Tactical: This is the level where the action plan gets drafted. This is the middle tier of an organization that heads the vast procurement, communication, and logistics channels of a fashion brand. The managers bring their expertise and experience into the picture to make the policy doable. They introduce the integration processes and coordinate with each other for the alignment of roles and responsibilities.

Operational: This is the final level or the level of implementation. These are the operational heads who make the employees, suppliers, and other stakeholders aware of the changes in a clothing organization for them to fully participate in the process. This necessarily involves a feedback system which is used to finetune the supply chain integration for predictive and prescriptive analysis and follow-ups.

What barriers do you need to overcome?

Supply chain integration can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive task for companies. But lack of such integration will result in highly isolated companies that are unable to take advantage of economies of scale or better business practices that are being employed by competitors. Here are a few of the most commonly faced barriers to the integration process.

1. Lack of knowledge or access to technology

Technology plays a major role in supply chain integration . Global fashion brands are using AI and fully-automated communication and tracking systems . Smaller businesses may not have access to such technologies. They can hire resourceful aggregator platforms that can deliver on the integration at optimized costs.

2. Cost of integration

Supply chain integration is cost-intensive. It requires capital investment and recurring managerial costs. Affordability has to be pictured before committing to an integration process.

3. Lack of information sharing

Supply chain integration requires the cooperation of both the supply-side businesses along with internal departments. But suppliers can be wary of being monitored or sharing information that can be crucial to their business staying competitive.

4. Demand distortion-bullwhip

A bullwhip effect sets in when the procurement is based on inaccurate data that is inconsistent with consumer demands. This results in distorted information sharing which can negate the whole process of supply chain integration .

5. Lack of inclusivity

Most businesses including clothing labels make the mistake of focusing on their internal growth and end up sidelining the customers and suppliers. This results in an information gap and mistrust which can be addressed by making the supply chain transparent and inclusive.

Supply chain integration isn't easy, but it's worth it

Earlier, there used to be logistics, but now there is supply chain integration , which is logistics 2.0: an evolved form of inventorying, warehousing, and shipping, which now clubs the whole procurement and last-mile delivery processes into one automated communication and monitoring platform. Connecting supply chains is not an easy task. From picking reliable suppliers to mitigating the impact of disruptions and making last-mile deliveries, supply chain integration makes it possible through a robust communication network.

Fashinza can help new clothing companies grow and large-scale businesses consolidate their operations by offering integrated solutions for supply chain management.

Auto-ID Application in the Supply Chain

This research project has several facets and sub-projects, some of which are described in the spreadsheet list of student projects. In general, the projects include:

Smart Objects Study: This project entails several studies that examine the benefits of unit-level traceability in the manufacturing and logistics processes. Several specific studies on-site are being conducted. Each one will contribute to a broader study being done with Stanford University to understand the potential long-term and disruptive impact of RFID on the supply chain.

Study of RFID application across leading practitioners and early adopters.

Study of RFID application in the logistics processes at consumer products manufacturers, including the linkage through to the trade customer.



Clockspeed – Supply Chain Design in the Internet Age

This research project entails applying and further developing the analytical supply chain design processes and principles presented in the book Clockspeed by Professor Charles Fine. He will make site visits to ISCM sponsors to apply and advance these supply chain design concepts. To date, Prof. Fine has conducted five Clockspeed sessions with ISCM sponsors. Much of the focus is on how new technologies and information systems integration are affecting business and supply chain design, including outsourcing and strategy.

Network Master and Multi-Tier Supply Chain Coordination

Led by Jim Rice, this project studies how companies could coordinate flows across the supply network (see the project site for downloads, including “Supply Chain versus Supply Chain: The Hype and the Reality,” an article published in Supply Chain Management Review, September–October 2001).



The work entailed developing a vision of possible structures, including one possibility as a “Network Master” (click here for a white paper on this subject). However. this role may be played by multiple parties as opposed to the single, most powerful “channel master” that many describe today.

Creating Lasting Values in Supply Chain Collaboration

This project was conducted by the MIT Integrated Supply Chain Management Program in collaboration with the Stanford Global Supply Chain Management Forum under the direction of Stanford Prof. Hau Lee.

This research project seeks to gain a deeper understanding of how to develop collaborative efforts, measure and value their impacts, and maintain and improve ongoing relationships. The research will be based on the case studies of a few collaborative efforts between selected sponsors from different industries and their respective key customer and supplier partners. These case studies will help us to gain insights and to develop hypotheses on strategies that can create lasting value in supply chain collaboration.

Supply Chain Visualization

This project entails the development of an interactive supply chain learning and design tool with a tangible user interface, a process knowledge database, and a system dynamics model to allow users to visualize the supply chain across multiple companies. The work is focused on developing the system to enable multiple users to simultaneously build, adjust, exercise, and assess the performance of various supply chain designs. Prof. Thomas Malone of the Center for Coordination Science, Prof. Hiroshi Ishii of the Media Lab Tangible Media Group, Dr. Jim Hines of the System Dynamics Group, and Jim Rice of the Center for Transportation & Logistics are collaborating on this project to develop what we refer to as “the magic table.”

The Supply Chain Process Handbook

This project involves ongoing work with the MIT Sloan School Center for Coordination Science (CCS) in developing the Supply Chain Process Handbook (SCPH). A proprietary web-based tool, the SCPH serves a practical purpose as a supply chain knowledge repository and a high-level purpose as a supply chain process redesign tool (see the attached page for additional information about the SCPH project). This includes sponsor access to the proprietary knowledge and an active plan to develop ISCM cases that illustrate the supply chain process redesign capabilities of the SCPH (see the attached page for additional information about the SCPH project).",integrated supply chain systems

Research on the Impact of Supply Chain Integration of Startups,https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=84250,Автор: H Lin,"Research on the Impact of Supply Chain Integration of Startups: Service Supply Chain Perspective ()

As the potential power of social economic development, the importance of startups has attracted more and more attention from academia. The service supply chain, led by the service integrator, can help the startups to improve the performance of the enterprise, achieve better supply chain integration, and go through their “infancy” period successfully. However, the research about the factors that influence the integration of service supply chain and how these factors affect the supply chain integration of startups remains to be explored. Based on the practical problems and theoretical research status above, this study constructs a theoretical hypothesis model of the relationship between interaction, supply chain finance and supply chain integration, and we take the survey data of 65 startups in Pearl River Delta of China as samples and use hierarchical regression analysis to carry out hypothesis testing. The result shows that, from the perspective of startups, interaction has a positive impact on supplier integration, internal integration and customer integration, and supply chain finance has a positive impact on internal integration. The main significance of this study is to make up for the vacancy on this part of the academic community in the service supply chain, and help provide some reference basis for start-up enterprises’ supply chain integration.

1. Introduction

With the transformation and upgrading of the world economic structure, the old mode of production is now seeking new breakthroughs. For the traditional product manufacturing supply chain, its marginal benefit shows a decreasing trend, and the feature of replicability also increases the operational risk of manufacturing enterprises. Therefore, more and more manufacturing enterprises are gradually transforming from “product-centric” to “service-oriented”, which means that the focus will be extended from manufacturing sector to the entire product life cycle. As a result, service outsourcing has become an important strategy for service-oriented enterprises to pursue industrial upgrading, which also promotes the traditional product manufacturing supply chain gradually transformed into a service supply chain.

Supported by the development of internet technology and internet economy, the global wave of entrepreneurship is rising, and that is especially remarkable in China under the vigorous promotion and support of Chinese government. However, most of the startups are faced with many problems, where limited funds and poor social relations are the most troublesome ones. Many startups spend a lot of effort on non-core aspects such as obtaining liquidity, seeking partners and building social relations, which distract their concentration on the core business and hinder the development of enterprises. As a result, according to statistics in [1] , China now has an average of 150,000 private-owned enterprises newly added each year, but at the same time more than 100,000 private-owned enterprises go bankrupt. Besides, about 60% of the private-owned enterprises cannot hold up for five years and the average life expectancy of them are only 2.9 years. Aimed at solving the problems above, supply chain service enterprises emerge as the times require and open up a new market. The supply chain service enterprises integrate various resources and build up a platform, where service request of startups (customers) are decomposed and outsourced to appropriate service providers (suppliers) on the platform. In that progress, the supply chain service enterprises are responsible for customer demand decomposition, service factor matching, information transfer, partnership maintenance and so on. Thanks to that, startups can focus on their core business.

Startups are not only a new power to stimulate national economic growth, but also an important force to stimulate domestic demand and create jobs. Therefore, how to help startups grow better is an issue of particular concern to all sectors of society. Considering the difficulties encountered in the early development of startups, this paper discusses the impact of supply chain finance and interaction on the supply chain integration of startups from the perspective of service supply chain. The main significance of this study is to make up for the vacancy on this part of the academic community in the service supply chain, and help provide some reference basis for start-up enterprises’ supply chain integration.

2. Theoretical background

2.1. Supply Chain Integration

Increasing the level of supply chain integration among supply chain members has become a necessity for the improving of the performance of the supply chain system. Despite the abundant research on unidimensional supply chain relationships, the SCI construct is a relatively new as an area of research [2] . Supply chain integration is defined as “the degree to which a firm can strategically collaborate with its supply chain partners and collaboratively manage the intra- and inter-organization processes to achieve effective and efficient flows of product and services, information, money and decisions with the objective of providing maximum value to customers at low cost and high speed” [2] . Vickery et al. state that the challenge of supply chain integration is the managerial capacity for combining resources and competencies from various supply chain members and business units, and directing all relevant parties towards an expanded resource base and competitive advantage [3] , which means that it should be strategically managed as an integrated system as opposed to individually optimized fragmented subsystems. Maloni and Benton report that in order to provide customers with greater value and gain competitive advantage, a higher level of cooperation is required for supply chain partners, which leads to integration of the supply chain [4] .

Some researchers characterize integration as interaction, in which communication in form of and information flows and meetings are employed to unite firms on supply chains [5] [6] [7] . Another type of researches characterize integration as collaboration, where firms on a supply chain or departments within a firm work collectively under common objectives [8] [9] . Others put forth a composite view which characterize integration as information sharing and involvement [10] [11] , while empirical work by these researches fail to delineate clearly between information sharing and involvement. This study build upon previous research on the SCI construct, arguing that the diverse dimensions of SCI being collapsed into three dimensions, supplier integration, internal integration and customer integration. In which supplier and customer integration are commonly referred to as external integration.

2.2. Resource-Based Theory

In 1984, Wernerfelt put forward “The Resource-Based Theory of the Firm”, and it symbolized the formal generation of the resource-based theory [12] . After that, the theory has been continually supplemented and improved by Barney Peterafand many other scholars through theoretical and empirical research [13] [14] . Nowadays, the resourced-based theory can be roughly divided into three schools---traditional resource theory, enterprise competence theory and enterprise knowledge-based theory. 1) The traditional resource theory, represented by Wernerfelt’s “The Resource-Based Theory of the Firm”, believes that an enterprise is a unique collection of all resources. In order to stand out in the competition, enterprises must acquire the valuable, scarce, heterogeneous, inimitable and irreplaceable resources. The focus of supply chain integration is to integrate the decisive resources with the features above, especially the internal resources that are difficult to obtain from external transactions. 2) The enterprise competence theory defines the enterprise competence as the capability to allocate resources reasonably and efficiently [15] , which is crucial to gain competitive advantage. What’s more, most scholars consider that the allocation of resources is a dynamic process. Only when the enterprise can adjust, configure and integrate the internal and external resources according to the change of the market environment can it occupy the favorable position of the market. 3) The knowledge-based theory considers that enterprise is the aggregation of knowledge which is summed up during the long-term practice and operation. Hence, enterprise needs to maintain long-term and continuous learning to expand the field of knowledge and keep competitive advantage.

In the field of supply chain management, the application of the resource-based theory emphasizes the integration and utilization of the internal and external resources of the enterprise. For startups, capital is one of the scarcest resources for survival and development. Accordingly, supply chain finance, as an effective way for startups to obtain funds, becomes an important direction to study supply chain integration. Meanwhile, interactions can help startups to establish and strengthen social relations and partnership, and get better external resources that they themselves cannot access. Therefore, from the perspective of resource-based theory, this paper discusses the impact of supply chain finance and interaction on achieving higher levels of supply chain integration in startups.

2.3. Transaction Cost Theory

The Transaction Cost Theory was proposed by Ronald Coase in 1937 when he put forward the famous Coase Theorem. According to the theory, enterprises acquire external resources in the process of market trading, but at the same time, it also produce transaction costs which may have negative impact on enterprise performance. Hence, rational allocation of resources is the key to reduce transaction costs. Williamson enriched the transaction cost theory on the basis of Coase’s research and proposed that asset specificity, transaction uncertainty and transaction frequency were three characteristics in the business process [16] . Besides, he concluded six factors that that could affect the transaction cost of an enterprise: opportunism behavior, bounded rationality, uncertainty, small numbers, information asymmetry and atmosphere. After that, the transaction cost theory has been widely used in social science reseach, including supply chain integration. In fact,the transaction cost theory can explain the formation mechanism of supply chain integration well. For example, Frohlich et al. and Flynn et al. suggest that enterprises that adopt the supply chain integration strategy will invest in specific assets according to their business needs [17] [18] . If an enterprise makes a separate investment in a specific asset, once the business needs to be replaced by the change in the market, that enterprise may have to take an expensive cost. Conversely, if supply chain partners can take a joint investment based on certain agreement, there will be a chance to reduce the risk.

The essence of supply chain is that enterprises can work synergetically to reduce overall transaction cost through the establishment of great partnerships. Interaction, as the essential feature of the service supply chain, can help promote the establishment, consolidation and expansion of relationships. Based on the analysis above, this paper will study the relationship between interaction and supply chain integration on the basis of transaction cost theory in startups.

3. Literature Review and Hypothesis Development

At present, the definition of service supply chain in the academic circles can be divided into three categories. The first one considers the service supply chain as the service-related links in the supply chain, and the second one describes the service supply chain as the supply chain of the service industry or the service sector. Based on the limitations of the two definitions above, this paper agrees with the third definition that defines the service supply chain as an integrated supply chain which is service oriented [19] . In this supply chain, the supply chain service enterprise occupies a leading position. once the downstream customer makes a service request, the service integrator will respond immediately, and then decompose and assign it to service providers at different service positions to meet requirements step by step. through this process, service providers cooperate with each other and constitute a supply relationship, and the integration and management of various elements in the whole supply chain is undertaken by the service integrator. Hence, in summary, the service supply chain discussed in this study refers to the third type of definition above, which is a supply chain oriented by the integration of resources and service. Besides, scholars have divided the supply chain integration into several dimensions from different angles and structures [2] [5] [6] . Based on previous research, this paper divides the supply chain integration into supplier integration, customer integration and internal integration.

3.1. Relationship between Interaction and Supply Chain Integration

Interaction is a typical feature of the service supply chain and it emphasizes the active and conscious mutual influence among the supply chain members. The concept of interaction is different from information exchange and communication. Information exchange is the basis of interaction and communication, while communication means that two parties negotiate and fulfill their commitments in an agreed framework. By contrast, interaction is a process of mutual learning and value co-creation under non-constraint conditions. Hakansson proposed the basic framework of the interactive model, describing interaction using interactive process, interactive subject, environment and atmosphere [20] . In service supply chain, the elements of interaction include all kinds of internal and external resources, such as products, information, funds, service brands and so on. Based on our research objects, this paper discusses the interaction between the startups and the service integrator.

With the rise of service outsourcing, the interaction has become a key link to improve performance of the service supply chain members. Edvardsson and Cova believe that the enterprise connections in the service supply chain is no longer a simple supply-demand relationship in upstream and downstream, but an interdependent relationship, which is resulted from the joint action of both parties [21] . Therefore, the interaction in the service supply chain can promote the overall integration of supply chain. Song Hua considers that in current economic context, customer consumption is more and more personalized [19] . The interaction between supply and demand can help deepen the understanding of customer requests, while technological advances make that process much more efficient. More importantly, through supply chain interaction, enterprises can effectively explore partners’ resources and capabilities, so as to better cooperate with other supply chain members in terms of strategy, operation and process. At the same time, startups are mostly technology-oriented enterprises who adopt differentiation strategy, and for them interaction can make the capability and effectiveness of resource integration substantially enhanced. Yu et al. propose that interaction is a typical feature of the service supply chain, and it will have an significant impact on cooperation performance [22] . It is considered that it is possible to study in this area [23] . Besides, through empirical research on logistics service supply chain, Gao et al. find that interaction can promote cooperation between supply chain members in upper and lower stream, reduce overall cost of supply chain, and achieve higher level of value co-creation [24] . Hence, we argue that interaction is a capability for supply chain enterprises to gain competitive advantage. Thus, we propose:

H1a: interaction is positively related to supplier integration

H1b: interaction is positively related to customer integration

H1c: interaction is positively related to internal integration

3.2. Relationship between Supply Chain Finance and Supply Chain Integration

Supply chain finance, as an important means to deal with financing difficulties, has effectively solved the fund problem of many small and medium-sized enterprises since the launch of the market. The traditional enterprise financing service is provided by the bank, while the current supply chain finance is now making the capital suppliers more diversified. In order to build a more competitive service supply chain platform and serve customers better, many supply chain service integrators have started to provide supply chain finance service. Unlike the traditional “1+N” model of the bank and also different from the internet financial model based on big data such as Alibaba and Tencent, the supply chain service integrators make use of their good credit qualifications, sufficient cash flow and other resource advantages to get credit from the bank, and then provide funds for customers who cannot get financing from banks or other channels. Facts have proved that supply chain finance is quite helpful for startups. In entrepreneurial stage, startups do not have strong ability to resist risks and gain stable returns, which leads to the failure of the startups to obtain a higher credit rating, so it is hard for them to get bank loans. By the help of supply chain finance, startups can timely get valuable funds through the supply chain service integrator as an intermediary.

Tang et al. research on the financial service in the logistic supply chain by analyzing the small and medium-sized enterprises through the game model, and they draw the conclusion that the development of logistics finance can strengthen the overall integration of supply chain [25] . Peng et al. study and demonstrate that the supply chain finance model of iron and steel industry has a positive impact on the performance of its supply chain integration [26] . Yu et al. put forward the function mechanism of supply chain finance to supply chain integration, and demonstrate that supply chain finance can not only promote the supply chain integration through the flow of funds, but also through information flow and logistics [22] . Thus, based on the theoretical basis above we propose:

H2a: supply chain finance is positively related to supplier integration

H2b: supply chain finance is positively related to customer integration

H2c: supply chain finance is positively related to internal integration

3.3. Theoretical Model

Based on the theoretical research basis and hypothesis above, the overall research model is shown in Figure 1. To be mentioned that, due to space constraints, the relationship between supply chain finance and interaction, as well as the indirect effect of interaction on supply chain integration as the intervening variable, will be further studied in the future.

4. Method

4.1. Questionnaire Design and Measure

The purpose of this paper is to study the impact of interaction and supply chain finance on supply chain integration in the service supply chain. To ensure the reliability and validity of the test scale, most of the questionnaire items used for the measurement of the constructs were adopted from previous studies in the field of supply chain management. The questionnaire is shown in Appendix A.

Items for the interaction variable were selected from Song et al. and Gao et al. which includes seven questions [19] [24] . Items for the supply chain finance variable were selected from Song et al. including seven questions also [19] . Supply chain integration was divided into three parts: supplier integration, internal integration, and customer integration, in which supplier integration included four questions, internal integration included three questions, and customer integration included four questions, all of which were selected from Flynn et al. [2] . All constructs were measured using a five?point Likert scale. All questionnaire items were marked between strongly disagree (= 1) and strongly agree (= 5) except for information sharing items, which are marked between totally not (= 1) and quite extensively (= 5). Since the initial questionnaire drawn from English, the items were translated into Chinese by one person, the Chinese version was then

translated back into English by another one, and the translated version was checked against the original one, and no discrepancy was found.

4.2. Sampling and Data Collection

Different from previous empirical researches on supply chain integration which are based on Western economies, this study focuses on China. Using a large scale empirical study, 65 startups located in Pearl River Delta area, Guangdong Province were investigated. To obtain a representative sample, enterprise yellow pages were used. Besides, relation resources of MBA and EMBA also contribute to our sampling pool. For each randomly selected respondent, we identified a key informant, only those with a title such as president or CEO, vice president, manager, or director that were knowledgeable enough about the firm and its supply chain’s internal and external processes were accepted. A profile of the respondents is presented in Table 1 and Table 2, from which we can see that the respondent firms represent a variety of industries, and most of the respondents have been in their position for at least 3 years which indicates that they should be knowledgeable enough about the information requested.

To assess potential late response bias, early and late responses were compared in terms of number of employees, physical assets and annual sales, with a t-test showing no significant differences. Besides, the potential for common method bias was assessed since there was one informant each organization.

4.3. Reliability and Validity

The reliability and validity of the data must be tested when the data are used to verify the structural equation. The reliability test of this study uses the Cronbach’s α coefficient test and the results are shown in Table 3. It can be seen that the Cronbach’s α values of all the variables are greater than 0.75, which means that the data has good reliability.

Then we use confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) method to test the structural validity and discriminate validity for the data, and the results are shown in Table 4-6.

From the tables it can be seen that, the model fit indices were χ2 /df = 1.935, CFI = 0.981, RMSEA = 0.021, RMR = 0.006, PNFI = 0.580, PCFI = 0.632. Thus, the model was acceptable, revealing convergent validity [27] . Furthermore, all the standardized estimates of the measurement items were great than 0.5, and the t-values were all greater than 2.0, and each item’s coefficient is greater than twice its standard error. While Bagozzi and Yi suggested that each factor loading should be greater than 0.50 and all of our 33 items are greater than 0.5, thus we satisfied the more detailed criteria set by several other studies as indicated above.

Table 6. Discriminant validity test results.

Note: ***means p < 0.001; **means p < 0.05(two-tailed).

Therefore, our constructs have convergent validity. Since all modification indices provided by AMOS revealed no parameters that could be released to improve model fit significantly, the discriminant validity was verified. Furthermore, the average variance extracted (AVE) for each construct was greater than the squared correlation [28] , as shown in Table 6.

4.4. Analysis and Results

This study intended to assess the relationship of the 5 variables: interaction, supply chain finance, supplier integration, internal integration, and customer integration using SPSS 19.0 and the hierarchical regression analysis method and maximum Pseudo-Likehood method is used to estimate the value of model indices and path coefficients.

The hypothesis test results are shown in Table 7, and it shows that there is a positive correlation between interaction and supplier integration (β H 1a = 0.423, P < 0.001), internal integration (β H 1b = 0.403, P < 0.001) and customer integration (β H 1c = 0.326, P < 0.001), and supply chain finance also has as significant positive influence on internal integration of startups (β H 2b = 0.326, P < 0.001). However,

Note: ***means p < 0.001; **means p < 0.05(two-tailed).

there is no significant correlation between supply chain finance, supplier integration (β H 2a = 0.009, P < 0.05) and customer integration (β H 2c = 0.004, P < 0.05). To sum up, the hypothesis H1a, H1b, H1c and H2b are supported, while H2a and H2c are rejected. The overall results are shown in Table 8.

5. Discussion and Management Inspiration

5.1. Discussion

1) Influence of Interaction on Supply Chain Integration.

The key significance between the interaction and supply chain integration has been widely recognized by the theoretical community, but empirical research targeting the special group of start-up companies is very scarce. Through the study of the relationship between interaction and supply chain integration, we found that interaction has positive impacts on supplier integration (p < 0.001), internal integration (p < 0.001) and customer integration (p < 0.001), that is, H1a, H1b and H1c get support. This means that startups can enhance the profundity and level of supply chain integration by enhancing their interaction with service integrators and using service integrators as the medium.

In the service supply chain, the relationship between supply and demand is no longer a simple upstream-downstream relationship, but a mutually dependent commercial-ecology. For startups, from the process of interaction, they not only regard supply chain service integrators as service providers, but also collaborators who help their partners acquire difficult-to-acquire capabilities, knowledge and resources, and build social networks. Correspondingly, supply chain service integrators can learn more about the development pain points of startups, excavate market demand, and innovate service products in this process. Therefore, through interactions, service integrators and startups can share their own experiences, knowledge and capabilities to face the fierce market competition together and realize corresponding value appeals.

2) Supply Chain Finance Impact on Supply Chain Integration Discussion

Although some scholars have suggested that there is an interaction between supply chain finance and supply chain integration, there are few studies to

empirically verify the relationship between them, especially for the startups who have the most urgent need for supply chain financial services. This study found that supply chain finance has a positive effect on internal integration (p < 0.001) through research on the relationship between supply chain finance and supply chain integration. This means that in Chinese context, if startups can improve the level of supply chain finance cooperation with their service integrators, that will help startups to realize internal integration.

In reality, there are always some certain “cost depression” in the supply chain. These “costs depression” are often small and medium-sized enterprises with unstable capital chains. These startups have become the bottleneck that restricts the development of supply chain, affecting the stability and financial cost of the supply chain. For startups, they have very good prospects for development, but they are often short-funded because of the adverse payment policies of upstream and downstream companies. In order to help startups solve financing problems, supply chain service integrators use their own credit qualifications as guarantees to provide startups with new financing channels, which not only enriches the means of profit, but also promotes the overall development of the service supply chain.

Besides, integrating supply chain financial services into supply chain management is also an effective way to control supply chain costs. With the help of supply chain finance provided by service integrators, startups can make loans through items such as orders or inventory which cannot be mortgaged by themselves before. In other words, supply chain finance service converts uncontrollable risks into controllable risks and converts uncontrollable costs into controllable costs. To sum up, supply chain finance can provide startups with valuable liquidity funds to better carry out production and business activities, allowing the companies to improve their internal integration and optimizing the overall performance of the supply chain.

5.2. Management Inspiration

Based on the empirical analysis results, this study draws the following management implications:

1) The existence of interaction facilitates the realization of supply chain integration. The global manufacturing industry is facing severe challenges at present and it is imperative to seek industrial upgrading. On the other hand, the demand for industrial upgrading has prompted the transition of traditional supply chains to new service supply chains. In the kind of supply chain, supply chain service enterprises play an important role in resource integration and information transmission. Upstream suppliers and downstream customers can directly interact with supply chain service enterprises to achieve their own demands, which help them to get rid of the complex traditional “1-to-N” mode. For Startups, they must be aware that outsourcing the non-core businesses to supply chain service integrators can enable them to get higher efficiency of resource utilization and better get through the “infancy” period. On other words, the good interaction between startups and supply chain service integrators can help them focus on the construction of core competitiveness and deepen the level of supply chain integration. This kind of interaction can also enable both parties to share their own experiences and capabilities and face problems and dilemmas together. On this basis, start-up companies can achieve their own faster growth, and service integrators can build a more comprehensive service supply chain platform to expand more service projects and realize a “multi-win” situation.

2) Supply chain finance can solve the financial difficulties of startups, thereby promoting the production and operation activities of enterprises, and achieving better internal integration of startups. Most startups are small in scale and have poor ability to resist risks. What’s more there is no relevant credit record in the bank, which makes them impossible to obtain loans from the bank. Under such adverse conditions, the supply chain finance service provided by the service supply chain integrators solve the urgent needs of the startups. However, the empirical results of this study shows that supply chain finance does not have a significant effect on the overall integration of supply chain. We consider the reason is that many startups are still using traditional financing ways and lack of understanding of supply chain finance. Therefore, start-up companies should early establish the sense of supply chain finance and use that way to revitalize stock assets and expand financing channels, so as to achieve a higher level of internal integration, and improving the overall performance of supply chain

6. Conclusion and Limitation

6.1. Conclusion

In this paper, we investigated the impact of interaction, supply chain finance on supply chain integration using the data collected from 65 startups enterprises in the Pearl River Delta Region. We study and explore the relationship with the tool of structural equation modeling and get some practical value of research findings:

Firstly, interaction has a significant positive impact on all the three dimensions of supply chain integration, which means that startups should improve the level of communication and cooperation with partners to enhance the degree and levels of integration of the supply chain, and to better cope with the uncertainty of the external environment. Secondly, supply chain finance has a significant positive influence on internal integration, which means that if startups can improve the level of supply chain finance cooperation with their service integrators, that will help startups to realize a better internal effectiveness. Lastly, the results show that the impacts of supply chain finance on supplier integration and customer integration are not significant for startups now under China’s market condition, which does not negate the importance of supply chain finance. We speculate the differences might be related to the fact that many startups are still using the traditional ways to financing while they lack full understanding of supply chain finance.

6.2. Limitation

The study has several limitations which open up venues and stimulus for further research, which mainly reflected in the following aspects: 1) The indirect value of interaction, this study only considered the direct effect of interaction on supply chain integration for startups, which may have underestimated the indirect effects of supply chain finance through the interaction, thus the indirect value of interaction could be further explored in the future study; 2) Wider geographical and cross-regional market segmentation of research subjects, the research model of this paper is based on the startups enterprises in Pearl River Delta Region, which limits the conclusions to promote in wider region because of the administrative region segmentation in China, and to draw more general conclusions, wider geographical and cross-regional market segmentation could be explored in the future study.

Supply chain integration also involves using technology to increase efficiency, improve communication, and optimize operations throughout the entire supply chain. This article will explain what supply chain integration is, its benefits, key components, and how to implement it in your business.

What is Supply Chain Integration?

Supply chain integration is the process of integrating the various parts of the supply chain in order to create a seamless, end-to-end system. The goal of supply chain integration is to optimize efficiency and effectiveness throughout the entire supply chain.

In order to achieve supply chain integration, businesses need to have a clear understanding of their own processes as well as those of their suppliers and customers. They need to know what each link in the supply chain does and how it fits into the overall system. By understanding these things, businesses can identify areas where there is room for improvement and make changes that will streamline the entire process.

Supply chain integration can be a challenge because it requires coordination between many different people and organizations. But when done correctly, it can lead to significant cost savings and improved customer satisfaction.

Benefits of Supply Chain Integration

There are many benefits of supply chain integration. By integrating the various parts of the supply chain, businesses can improve communication and coordination between departments, reduce costs, and improve efficiency.

Integrated supply chains can help businesses to better forecast demand and manage inventory levels. They can also help to reduce lead times and improve responsiveness to customer needs. In addition, by sharing information across the supply chain, businesses can identify opportunities for cost savings and process improvements.

Implementation Strategies for Supply Chain Integration

There are many different ways to go about integrating your supply chain. The most important part is to develop a strategy that meets the specific needs of your company while also taking into consideration the complexities of your supply chain. Here are a few general tips to get you started:

1. Define Your Goals

The first step is to clearly define what you hope to achieve through supply chain integration. Do you want to reduce costs, increase efficiency, or improve customer satisfaction? Once you know what your goals are, you can start developing a plan to meet them.

2. Analyze Your Supply Chain

Before you can start making changes, you need to understand how your current supply chain operates. This includes identifying all of the steps involved in getting your product from supplier to customer. Once you have a good understanding of how your supply chain works, you can start looking for areas where improvements can be made.

3. Identify Opportunities for Integration

After analyzing your supply chain, you should have a good idea of where integration would be most beneficial. Perhaps there are multiple suppliers who could be consolidated into one or there are several steps in the process that could be combined or streamlined. By identifying opportunities for integration, you can start developing a plan for how to make those changes happen.

4. Implement Your Plan

Once you have developed a plan for how to integrate your supply chain, it’s time to put that plan into action. This will likely require

Reading: Integrated Supply Chain Management,https://courses.lumenlearning.com/clinton-marketing/chapter/reading-integrated-supply-chain-management/,N/A,"As the importance of managing the supply chain well has increased, companies have acknowledged that they must manage the supply chain as a complete system and treat it as an integrated function. When an organization takes an integrated approach, it is recognizing that it cannot manage each part of the supply chain as an independent function, but instead needs to understand and manage the connections and interdependencies.

Within the supply chain organization, this means that sourcing, demand planning, inventory planning, warehousing, logistics, and order-fulfillment functions must work together. The rise of supply chain software tools that bring this data and information together in one place is just one indicator of an increasingly integrated focus. Also, many organizations previously had these functions spread between different organizations with little opportunity to interact. Today, most large organizations have an integrated supply chain function with a common management team and common objectives.

Beyond the work occurring within the supply chain organization, there are important connections to marketing, finance, and manufacturing. Marketing plays a direct role in creating the demand forecast and defining the product and delivery expectations for customers. These must be reviewed with the supply chain team so that everyone knows what needs to be achieved, and when that isn’t possible, adjustments can be made and communicated to customers early. The integration with finance is necessary to ensure that investments are budgeted correctly and inventory is accounted for accurately. Manufacturing is often most heavily affected by decisions and requirements of the supply chain team, as they are counting on having an adequate supply and must meet delivery time lines to keep customer commitments.

As with many complex organizational challenges, this integration works best when there are clear objectives that are set across the organizations, a common view of the data (which identify opportunities for improved performance), and clear, frequent communication about potential issues and needs. This enables all of the organizations to focus on delivering value to customers and achieving the company mission.",integrated supply chain systems

What Is Logistics Planning? Strategies To Save Money and Time,https://www.shopify.com/ie/blog/logistics-planning,3 дня назад,"Imagine a skin care company that sources the finest active ingredients from suppliers around the world and then transforms them into potent formulations. The finished products, elegantly packaged in branded glass jars, go to regional centers, where they’re readied to make their way to customers’ doorsteps. Behold the power of effective logistics planning—ensuring that every element of your supply chain operates without a hitch, from start to finish.

Learn more about what great logistics planning looks like, and the benefits and strategies you can use to reduce costs and be more agile.

What is logistics planning?

Logistics planning is the coordination and management of goods from suppliers to end users, including raw material acquisition, manufacturing, transportation, warehousing, and delivery strategies. This involves synchronizing all supply chain elements to ensure smooth business operations from the point of origin to the point of consumption.

Businesses use logistics planning software like Magaya and Shopify order management to improve visibility, automate processes, anticipate problems, and find solutions that allow them to move efficiently through each phase.

Benefits of logistics planning

Logistics planning can optimize every aspect of your supply chain. Here are five primary benefits:

Reduces operational expenses

Logistics planning enables you to reduce supply chain costs through efficiency. For example, logistics software optimizes routes and consolidates shipments for lower transportation costs, and improves inventory management techniques to reduce holding and warehousing expenses.

Refining these logistical elements can help minimize supply chain disruptions, improve operational efficiency, and allocate resources more effectively.

For instance, a furniture manufacturer detecting increased demand for home office setups can put in place measures to expedite its supply of desks and ergonomic chairs to retailers.

Better collaboration with supply chain partners

The logistics planning process fosters collaboration with supply chain partners. Sharing real-time data and aligning goals enables synchronized operations, ensuring integration across the supply chain. This enhanced cooperation prevents delays and reduces errors in order fulfillment.

Faster delivery times for customers

Effective supply chain management leverages predictive analytics and real-time tracking to accelerate customer delivery times. A logistics manager uses these tools to anticipate demand surges, strategically adjust inventory, and choose the fastest shipping routes. This approach minimizes transit times and expedites order fulfillment.

7 tips for effective logistics planning in ecommerce

Effective logistics planning helps ecommerce businesses to ensure timely deliveries and maintain customer satisfaction. Here are seven tips to improve your logistics:

1. Implement data-driven demand forecasting

Collect historical sales data, market trends, and seasonality factors to create a comprehensive dataset. Use advanced analytics tools with machine learning algorithms, like SAP Integrated Business Planning, Oracle Demand Management, and Kinaxis RapidResponse, to predict customer demand more accurately.

Integrate these forecasts into your logistics plan to adjust inventory levels, optimize procurement schedules, and align your supply chain operations to meet anticipated demand fluctuations. For instance, if you notice a spike in sales every summer, increase inventory and expedite shipping in preparation for the surge in orders.

2. Communicate with key suppliers

Regularly communicate your needs and expectations to key suppliers to build transparency and mutual understanding. Develop long-term contracts and collaboration agreements as part of your strategic logistics plan to foster trust and reliability.

If your ecommerce business plans to launch a new product line, close collaboration with suppliers can ensure timely availability of materials and components, preventing product rollout delays.

CargoSense Raises $8 Million for Supply Chain Automation,https://www.pymnts.com/news/investment-tracker/2024/cargosense-raises-8-million-to-enhance-supply-chain-automation/,9 часов назад,"Supply chain automation firm CargoSense has raised $8 million in new funding.

The Series A round was led by Lanza techVentures and included participation from Merck Global Health Innovation Fund (MGHIF), according to a Wednesday (June 12) press release.

The company said the new funding will help it expand its partner network of integrated management systems, data sources, and industrial Internet of Things (IoT) platforms available to digital agents running on the CargoSense Visibility operating system.

“This will empower CargoSense’s global customers with the tools to automate and simplify additional aspects of their supply chain operations,” the company said in the release.

“The freight tech landscape continues to grow, and so have the complexities involved with incorporating new innovations into the technology stacks that supply chain teams depend on.”

Among those teams is one at pharmaceutical giant Merck, which worked with CargoSense to automate analysis of its parcel program to catch delivery problems in real time, and optimize decisions around distribution and packaging at the individual parcel level.

The results of this effort, the release said, led to the MGHIF investment in CargoSense to help automate supply chains throughout the pharmaceutical industry.

“Buyers of visibility data and related supply chain technologies for manufacturers and distributors all share an expectation: that it will reduce workloads for their supply chain teams,” said CargoSense founder and CEO Richard Kilmer.

“The reality is frequently the opposite, where there’s a large gap between new technology and their day-to-day operations, and people bridge the gap with additional manual effort and process complexity.”

PYMNTS looked at efforts to update supply chain models earlier this year, noting that they often rely on manual processes and disjointed communication, causing them to struggle to keep up with the demands of 2024’s dynamic markets.

“Recognizing this gap, businesses are increasingly turning to advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), automation and blockchain to transform and modernize every aspect of their supply chain processes,” that report said.

And in an interview with PYMNTS, GreyOrange CEO Akash Gupta shed light on how these advanced technologies, including robotics, AI and what he termed “an intelligent software orchestration layer,” have been instrumental in streamlining warehousing and fulfillment processes, while efficiently managing inventory flow and data.

He pointed to this company’s AI-driven platform, which he said models optimal decisions and outcomes to ensure seamless workflow management, and its single-view format for inventory nodes, providing visibility and control of the entire supply chain network.

“You’re getting a holistic view of what’s happening in the network,” Gupta said, “rather than looking at a bunch of Excel files … and it helps the interaction between sales managers and warehouse managers.”

Share This News Story:

SHANGHAI : BERG Propulsion has won a contract covering the hybrid propulsion solution that ensure three wind-assisted Louis Dreyfus Armateurs (LDA) ro-ro vessels will maximize efficiency regardless of their mode of operation.

Following delivery by China’s Wuchang Shipbuilding from 2026 onwards, the innovative vessels will carry Airbus A320 Family jetliner subassemblies from France (Saint-Nazaire) to the final assembly line in the United States (Mobile, Alabama). The ships have been designed by Deltamarin with the aim of halving fuel burn and CO2 emissions in transatlantic operations by 2030 compared to a 2023 baseline.

Wind power drawn from six Flettner rotor-sails on each ship’s deck will make a strong contribution to reduced emissions, with weather routing optimization software also in place to maximize wind-assisted time and minimize drag. In conventional mode, the ships will run on dual fuel methanol engines.

Optimizing propulsion performance at all times will rely on integrated power management and propulsion systems from BERG. LDA has specified the supplier’s extensive engine-agnostic propulsion package for newbuild ships. As well as the complete propulsion train to work with each ship’s main engines, BERG is supplying state-of-the-art controllable pitch propellers with feathering capability.

Arthur Barret, Head of Engineering, Project & Innovation Department, LDA, commented: “At LDA, our ambition is to lead the maritime industry through its energy transition. We must ensure that the solutions supporting our vision are the smartest available and that we can rely on our technology partners throughout a ship’s lifetime. BERG’s integrated propulsion system enables us to minimize fuel consumption and emissions.”

Amrita Singh, Account Manager, BERG Propulsion, explained that the BERG hybrid solution allows main engines and electric motors to drive propulsion either independently or simultaneously so that the most efficient power option is used as a vessel’s operational needs change.

“The system works with alternative power sources, including wind,” said Singh. “It’s key when integrating sails that they work seamlessly with propulsion controls so that adjustments can be made to thrust in any given weather and sea condition. In BERG’s solution, Dynamic Drive is integrated into the MPC800 control system, which delivers this capability without the operational complexity of additional hardware.”

“The propulsion package includes a range of ‘modes’, whose selection optimizes performance across the ship’s various operational requirements,” explained Mattias Dombrowe, Business Manager – Electrical System Integration, BERG Propulsion. “As well as mechanical with PTO or electric modes, propellers also operate in boost mode to achieve full speed when required. When the rotor sails are in service, one or both of the propellers can be feathered to optimize wind-assisted operations.”

Crew continuously optimize efficiency using the flexibility available to the propulsion control unit, rather than being limited by the predetermined relationships between engine load and specific fuel oil consumption, said Dombrowe.

Integration had also been a feature of the way BERG teams worked with CSSC yard Wuchang Shipbuilding to satisfy owner expectations, according to Wei Jun Zhang, Account Manager BERG Shanghai. “Working alongside Wuchang Shipbuilding has been an absolute pleasure, allowing us to showcase the competency, capacity, and capabilities that BERG has to maximize the performance of these innovative ships.”",integrated supply chain systems
MOSA – Friend or foe? - Military Embedded Systems,https://militaryembedded.com/avionics/software/mosa-friend-or-foe,19 часов назад,"MOSA – Friend or foe?

Blog

As I travel to various places around the world, I am surprised by the perception that different government and supplier organizations have of the modular open systems approach (MOSA). MOSA is designed to lower costs for global coalition forces while accelerating new, highly competitive capabilities for the Warfighter, but folks still do not understand these benefits and sometimes turn MOSA into something that should be feared.

Let us be clear – MOSA simply wants to enable the rapid insertion of the most competitive warfighter technologies. I looked at three of its architectural and operational capabilities:

To drive affordable innovation throughout the supply chain based upon open standards and an open systems architecture (OSA); To leverage the latest advancements in silicon with software that fully enables artificial intelligence (AI) that will augment rapid Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2) decision-making; To fully enable CJADC2 to deliver the most comprehensive situational-awareness visualizations to the warfighter and commanders for rapid and precise executions of threat responses.

The mandate for MOSA

MOSA is not a new, unproven process for efficiency – it is a remarkably simple and straightforward open systems blueprint for procuring the best, most competitive technologies for creating unequivocal advantages for all coalition armed forces. Ten years ago, MOSA was an interesting purchasing and design concept; today, MOSA is the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD)-preferred method for implementation of open systems and is in fact required by U.S. law. Title 10 U.S.C. 4401(b) states that all major defense-acquisition programs (MDAP) are to be designed and developed using a MOSA that:

Employs a modular design that uses modular system interfaces between major systems, major system components, and modular systems

Is subjected to verification to ensure that relevant modular system interfaces comply with, if available and suitable, widely supported and consensus-based standards

Uses a system architecture that allows severable major system components at the appropriate level to be incrementally added, removed, or replaced throughout the life cycle of a major system platform to afford opportunities for enhanced competition and innovation.

Complies with the technical data rights set forth in 10 U.S.C. 3771-3775

Core requirements for MOSA

Achieving the benefits of MOSA requires adherence to five major MOSA principles:

Establish an enabling environment – A program manager must establish supportive system requirements, business practices, technology development, acquisition, test & evaluation, and product support strategies. Employ modular design – Functionality must be isolated during the design process to enable the system to be easier to develop, maintain, modify, and upgrade. A modular systems design will provide the foundation to upgrade or change functions that change or evolve quickly over time with minimum impact on the rest of the system. This is accomplished using open industry standards for key interfaces. Designate key interfaces – A MOSA system design manages key interfaces to utilize open standards to produce the most life cycle benefits possible. Use open standards – Open hardware and software interface standards must be well-defined, mature, widely used, and readily available, enabling rapid interchangeability, interoperability, interconnection, compatibility, communication, and logistics support. Open standards managed by independent standards organizations enable immediate support from a wide supply chain supporting an existing market with proven commercial products and related safety and security certification evidence. Certify conformance – MOSA module verification and conformance to key interfaces based upon open industry standards is the foundation of program efficiency. Proven conformance notably reduces multiple-supplier integration risk, driving accelerated deployment and higher levels of quality throughout the system.

The use of the FACE standard in MOSA programs

The use of The Open Group Future Airborne Capability Environment (FACE) Technical Standard and Business Approach is now widely referenced as a proven strategy to use open standards-based software in programs using MOSA. The FACE business approach and technical standard is independently managed by The Open Group as a consortium; more than 100 government and industry entities have worked to establish this open avionics environment for all military airborne platforms. The consortium was formed in 2010 and is made up of military customers, avionics suppliers, and academia.

The FACE Technical Standard and Business Approach enables the U.S. and coalition partners to enable military aircraft to rapidly refresh their avionics platforms to support the latest advances in computer hardware and software. The FACE Technical Standard, a “standard of standards,” is based upon existing and proven open standards. There are over 60 open standards that the FACE standard supports, and these are managed by independent standards organizations that serve the global avionics community. These organizations include ANSI, ARINC, IEEE, IETF, Khronos Group, Object Management Group (OMG), and The Open Group, and they manage standards as diverse as ARINC 653, C/C++, DDS, IPv6, Java, OpenGL, POSIX, TCP, and Vulkan, with a wealth of existing commercial solutions. Many of these commercial products have existing airworthiness-certification evidence that both reduces risk and accelerates the deployment of critical airborne software.

Conformance eases integration and accelerates deployment

One of the hallmark achievements of the FACE Consortium is the creation of a conformance program to evaluate the presence of the key interfaces defined in the FACE Technical Standard. Conformance is also a key pillar of MOSA. FACE Conformance means that a product meets 100% of the applicable FACE Technical Standard requirements. There is no conformance category for a product that does not meet 100% of FACE API requirements – this condition provides greater assurance that conformant products are both portable and reusable, and should accelerate integration of software modules from a diverse supply chain.

One of the unsung heroes of the FACE approach is the adoption of proven industry standards. Instead of writing an entirely new and unproven set of APIs and a new, proprietary, U.S.-only solution stack, the FACE technical team decided early on that the use of existing avionics standards was the fastest and most feasible path to accelerating new capabilities to the warfighter. This standard-of-standards approach based upon open software standards already proven by global commercial suppliers accelerates military avionics efforts and does not waste industry time rewriting proven standards with yet another new, unproven, and proprietary API. Another benefit of this approach is that many commercial avionics software suppliers already have existing airworthiness certification evidence that is proven in flight – this proof reduces program risk and further accelerates the deployment of critical airborne software.

Is MOSA a friend? Or a foe?

MOSA brings with it a wide range of beneficial qualities. The only entities that should fear MOSA are first, supplier entities that have enjoyed unbridled largesse with government customers because they have a captive supply chain that locks in uncompetitive capabilities to the warfighter, or second, program managers who fear the change that MOSA brings and enjoy a cozy relationship with a single-source supply chain that requires minimum effort to manage. Although MOSA is driven from the top of the U.S. DoD, it is not a USA-only concept, and at its core is designed to be highly inclusive of the exceptional innovation of global defense partners.

MOSA is a friend of our warfighters. Its adoption across all armed forces and their supply chains will increase our global military competitiveness against all adversaries.
