658,$3M expansion coming to marine engineering office in ...,https://wgno.com/news/louisiana/jefferson-parish/3m-expansion-coming-to-marine-engineering-office-in-jefferson-parish/,16 часов назад,"ELMWOOD, La. (WGNO) — A marine engineering office in Jefferson Parish is getting a multi-million-dollar expansion.

Louisiana Economic Development and Birdon America officials announced the company is investing $3.3 million to create 25 new engineering and project management jobs to construct and deliver 27 waterways commerce cutter vessels.

They said the 25 new jobs are expected to have an average salary of $99,395.

According to LED, the project is expected to create 32 indirect jobs for 69 new jobs in the southeast.

The company announced the new vessels will be built over a span of 10 years, and that it will collaborate with defense technology partners.

“Louisiana is a major hub for shipbuilding in America. It made sense to grow in this area based on the history of the workforce, supply chain availability for shipbuilding and geographic proximity to bodies of water,” said Birdon America President Robert Scott.

167,'Thanks for your support!' Musk says Tesla shareholders ...,https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240613228/thanks-for-your-support-musk-says-tesla-shareholders-have-backed-his-56-billion-pay-package,1 день назад,"By Louis Goss

Elon Musk has said two controversial proposals that could see Tesla relocate to Texas and see Musk himself paid $56 billion for his work as CEO are currently on course to be approved by shareholders.

In a post on X, formerly Twitter, Musk posted two charts showing the cumulative vote counts for both proposals and said: ""Both Tesla shareholder resolutions are currently passing by wide margins! Thanks for your support!!""

The shareholder vote is set to close at 4:30 pm Central Daylight Time Thursday (5.30pm ET), the time zone that aligns with that used at Tesla's headquarters in Austin, Texas.

Proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services had previously urged shareholders to reject Musk's pay package which is set to give him around $56 billion worth of shares in Tesla, boosting his stake in the car maker from from 12.89% to 22.4%.

The California Public Employee Retirement System, also known as CalPERS, said in a statement on Wednesday it would be voting against Musk's pay package, citing concerns that it is worth more than 140 times the annual pay given to similar high-performing CEOs.

CalPERS, which has around $465 billion in assets under management, owns a $1.67 billion stake in Tesla making it one of the electric vehicle manufacturer's top 25 shareholders. The pension fund previously voted against Musk's pay deal in 2018.

In February, a Delaware court previously voided Musk's ""unfathomable"" pay package, citing concerns about the CEO's influence over the decision, which they said was a result of the board being ""swept up by rhetoric"" surrounding ""Musk's superstar appeal.""

If approved, Musk would still have to convince the Delaware court to approve the pay package, in the face of any additional legal challenges put forward against the all-or-nothing deal.

In the wake of the Delaware court's February decision, Tesla also announced plans that it would be reincorporating in Texas, following the company's decision to move its headquarters to the state, in a move that must also be approved by shareholders.

Shares in Tesla (TSLA) were up 4% on Thursday having lost 31% of their value over the previous 12 months amid concerns about mounting competition from low-priced rivals in China and a slowdown in the market for electric vehicles.

Musk has previously said he would consider diverting his own focus on developing artificial intelligence technologies away from Tesla if shareholders fail to approve his pay package, raising concerns that a vote against the resolution could negatively impact Tesla's share price.

Tesla was contacted by MarketWatch for comment.

122,1 in 4 businesses plans to increase in-office days next year,https://www.nwahomepage.com/news/national/1-in-4-businesses-plans-to-increase-in-office-days-next-year-report/,7 дней назад,"(The Hill) — More companies plan to impose stricter in-office mandates next year, even if it risks losing workers.

Recently published findings from a survey conducted by ResumeBuilder.com show that a quarter of companies with return-to-work policies plan to require employees to come into offices more frequently.

Companies with plans to increase employees’ in-office days are doing so mainly to improve productivity among their workforces.

Out of these companies, 86 percent said the top reason for increasing in-office workdays was to improve productivity while 71 percent said it was to improve company culture, according to the survey.

Another 57 percent of business leaders said they plan to mandate more in-office days to improve employee well-being while 55 percent said they were doing so to improve workforce retention.

“Unfortunately, I think many business leaders make assumptions about things like productivity, culture, and employee well-being,” said Julia Toothacre, resume and career strategist at ResumeBuilder.com.

“Productivity is a result of clear expectations and good management. Culture is driven by people, not physical spaces, and employee well-being is more about how people are managed, their stress levels, and the amount of flexibility they have.”

Businesses differ on just how many days a week workers should be required to be in the office.

A quarter of business leaders said employees should be in the office five days a week, 29 percent said four days a week is sufficient, 26 percent said three days, 11 percent said two days, two percent said one day and less than one percent said they believe employees should come in less than once a week, according to the survey.

These same companies, though, acknowledged that they have lost workers due to their existing return-to-office mandates.

Among businesses surveyed, 14 percent said they lost a lot of talent due to their return-to-office policy while 36 percent said they have lost some, 33 percent said they have lost a little and 16 percent said they have not lost any workers.

591,107 Customer Service Statistics and Facts You Shouldn't ...,https://www.helpscout.com/75-customer-service-facts-quotes-statistics/,21 мая 2024 г.,"Your customer experience is the main differentiator between you and your competitors, and all of the customer service statistics back it up.

Below, we’ve collected 107 key statistics exploring the relevance and importance of good customer service — and expanding on the cost and impacts of poor customer service.

Rather than view these statistics in a vacuum, layer them over your own experiences and the services you are currently offering. There’s a little something in the following chapters for everyone — whether you’re new and just trying to chart the way for your team or have been doing it for years.

The ROI of great customer service

“We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts. It’s our job every day to make every important aspect of the customer experience a little bit better.” –Jeff Bezos

Everyone wants to be known for providing excellent customer service. Not only does it feel good to be helpful, but it is a key differentiator, as the following customer service statistics show.

Customer service, when done well, has just as much impact as a strong sales funnel or excellent marketing efforts. Not only that, but if your customer service team does a fantastic job, it may help boost your other teams’ effectiveness.

It’s easier to make a sale when your customers feel supported, and word-of-mouth marketing after an extraordinary experience is one of the best pitches on the market.

Not convinced? Here are a few customer service statistics that serve to emphasize just how paramount excellent customer service can be for your bottom line:

68% of consumers say they are willing to pay more for products and services from a brand known to offer good customer service experiences. (HubSpot)

For 86%, good customer service turns one-time clients into long-term brand champions. (Khoros)

An NPS Promoter score has a customer lifetime value that's 600%-1,400% higher than a Detractor. (Bain & Company)

89% of consumers are more likely to make another purchase after a positive customer service experience. (Salesforce Research)

93% of customers are likely to make repeat purchases with companies who offer excellent customer service. (HubSpot Research)

If the company’s customer service is excellent, 78% of consumers will do business with them again after a mistake. (Salesforce Research)

Increasing customer retention rates by just 5% can increase profits by between 25% and 95%. (Bain and Company)

Nearly three out of five consumers report that good customer service is vital for them to feel loyalty toward a brand. (Zendesk)

A good customer service experience heavily impacts recommendations. Consumers who rate a company’s service as “good” are 38% more likely to recommend that company. (Qualtrics XM Institute)

Investing in new customers is between 5 and 25 times more expensive than retaining existing ones. (Invesp)

83% of customers agree that they feel more loyal to brands that respond and resolve their complaints. (Khoros)

Businesses can grow revenues between 4% and 8% above their market when prioritizing better customer service experiences. (Bain & Company)

80% of companies use customer satisfaction scores to analyze customer experience and improve it. (Harvard Business Review)

72% of companies believe they can use analytics reports to improve the customer experience. (Deloitte)

The customer experience management market worldwide is worth as much as $7.6 billion in 2020. This is a 16.9% year-over-year increase from its value of $6.5 billion in 2019. (Grand View Research)

As you can tell, excellent customer service is a name maker, no matter what your industry. It helps grow revenue, maintain customer loyalty, and improve your overall business strategy.

Key customer insights like customer satisfaction score and NPS help your customer service team improve and grow their impact. Beyond that, though, they also help your other customer-facing teams understand where they could be making improvements. Who wouldn’t want to give everyone else a leg up?

The cost of bad customer service

Now that we know how important good customer service can be for your business, it’s time to get a handle on the impact it can have when things go badly.

Just like good customer service leads to your team’s success, poor customer service sets them back. A good experience means that customers are much more inclined to go easy if another experience goes awry. The following customer service statistics help to illustrate this:

It takes 12 positive customer experiences to make up for one negative experience. (Ruby Newell-Legner’s ""Understanding Customers"")

65% of customers said they have changed to a different brand because of a poor experience. (Khoros)

After more than one bad experience, around 80% of consumers say they would rather do business with a competitor. (Zendesk)

Only one in five consumers will forgive a bad experience at a company whose customer service they rate as “very poor.” (Nearly 80% will forgive a bad experience if they rate the service team as “very good.”) (Qualtrics XM Institute)

78% of customers have backed out of a purchase due to a poor customer experience. (Glance)

Look at that last one! More than three-quarters of customers surveyed have backed out of a purchase because the customer service wasn’t as good as expected. If you showed that metric to your sales team, they would advocate for your customer service team to get as many resources as they need.

Beyond that, customer service sets the stage for the rest of your company to succeed. Your customer service’s impact is more widely felt than that of any other team. When they fail, everyone does — and your customers know it.

Caring about what customers think

It’s an ill-founded but common misconception that your customers don’t know as much as you do. While they certainly aren’t always right, they are very often at least thinking in the right direction. Similarly, they usually know when something has gone sideways or isn’t behaving the way it should be.

Your customers’ thoughts and opinions matter. They can help you build a better product, help improve your internal processes, and give you a good heads-up that they’re thinking about churning.

Here are some customer service statistics that will help you understand just what your average customer feels during or after an interaction:

90% of customers rate an ""immediate"" response as essential or very important when they have a customer service question. 60% of customers define ""immediate"" as 10 minutes or less. (HubSpot Research)

More than 70% of consumers believe that companies should collaborate on their behalf so they don’t have to repeat information to different representatives. (Zendesk)

90% of consumers worldwide consider issue resolution as their most crucial customer service concern. (KPMG)

70% of customers report that technology makes it simple to take their business to a competitor if needed. (Salesforce)

71% of consumers (age 16-24) believe that a quick response from a service team can drastically improve their customer experience. (Comm100)

Almost 90% of customers report trusting a company whose service they rate as “very good.” On the other hand, only 16% of those who give an “inferior” rating trust companies to the same degree. (Qualtrics XM Institute)

70% of the customer's journey is based on how the customer feels they are being treated. (McKinsey)

A customer is four times more likely to switch to a competitor if the problem they're having is service-based. (Bain and Company)

Nearly 90% of consumers trust a company whose service they’ve rated as “very good” to take care of their needs. (Qualtrics XM Institute)

There are a few metrics that stand out. The first is that most customers indicate that getting a response within 10 minutes of their request is essential or very important — that is a hugely impactful metric.

In a world where first response and resolution times are critical, how close are you to that 10-minute mark? With this level of response rate, 71% of younger consumers believe that their experience is drastically improved — and it snowballs from there.

When you’ve created an excellent customer service experience, you gain trust, protect yourself from customers going to your competitors, and prioritize making your customers’ journeys good ones.

The second exciting statistic is that more than 70% of consumers believe that companies should collaborate on their behalf. So if a customer reaches out about an issue with an integration that they are using with your product, rather than advising them to reach out to the other product’s support team, you respond directly instead.

This level of personalization and attention to detail can significantly impact your customers, as you’ll see in the next section.

The power of a personal touch

“If a customer likes you — and continues to like you — they will continue to do business with you. If they don’t, they won’t.” – Paul Greenberg

Everyone wants to feel known. They want to believe that the people in their lives are thinking about them, considering them, and understanding their wants and needs.

This extends to your customers, too. If you go a bit above and beyond to make your customers feel seen, heard, and cared about, it can have a massive impact on their experience and your company’s bottom line.

If you can educate yourself on the user’s background and history before a call, integrate that into the customer service session. If you're not diving deep and reviewing things like sales history or personal information, at least take the time to ask the customer’s name.

Read on to find some jaw-dropping customer service statistics around personalization:

70% of customers say service agents’ awareness of sales interactions is fundamental to keeping their business. (Salesforce)

80% of customers say the experience a company provides is just as necessary as its products or services. (Salesforce)

63% of consumers expect businesses to know their unique needs and expectations, while 76% of B2B buyers expect the same thing. (Salesforce Research)

59% of customers believe that companies need to provide cutting-edge digital experiences to keep their business. (Salesforce)

90% of people are more likely to trust a company if they have a firm privacy policy. (Salesforce)

Your online conversion rate can improve by roughly 8% when you include personalized consumer experiences. (Trust Pilot)

88% of people trust companies that vow not to share their personal information without permission. (Salesforce)

92% of customers appreciate companies giving them control over what information is collected about them. (Salesforce)

23% of businesses use social media as a tool to collect and analyze data. (Gartner)

79% of customers are willing to share relevant information about themselves in exchange for contextualized interactions in which they’re immediately known and understood. (Salesforce)

56% of customers don’t mind sharing their personal information in exchange for better service. (Salesforce)

On average, customer service agents only ask for a customer's name 21% of the time. (Glance)

As you can see, it’s not just about how you use a customer’s personal information, although that’s important. Many customers care about how you’re aggregating data and what you do with it after you have it.

More than half of customers are comfortable sharing personal information in exchange for excellent service, but you still need to use that data carefully. After all, about 90% of customers are more likely to trust you if you’ve got a stellar privacy policy.

Personalization helps to build deeper relationships, but only if it’s done correctly. If it isn’t done correctly, you can expect your customers to talk about it.

The importance of word-of-mouth

Customers love to talk. They’ll share their good experiences, bad experiences, and everything in between. Similarly, customers like to listen.

As you’ll see in the following customer service statistics, many users trust reviews from other customers or social media responses more than they trust the marketing of your actual company.

Providing an excellent customer service experience, especially within the public eye of social media, is a massive boon to your company’s marketing efforts.

While 50% of customers don’t share their experiences on social media, 72% will talk about them in person. That number gets even higher when considering how customers talk socially about poor experiences.

Read on for some pretty impressive and shocking customer service statistics around when people do or don’t share:

36% of consumers will share their customer service experience, whether good or bad. More than one-third report posting on Facebook, followed closely by Instagram. (CFI Group)

87% of consumers read online reviews for local businesses in 2020. (Bright Local)

72% of customers will share their good experiences with others. (Salesforce)

72% of customers will tell six or more people if they have a satisfying experience. (Esteban Kolsky)

94% of American customers will recommend a company whose service they rate as “very good.” (Qualtrics XM Institute)

67% of customers report a terrible customer experience as the reason for switching businesses. (Esteban Kolsky)

Only 13% of consumers will recommend a company whose customer service they’ve rated as “very poor.” (Qualtrics XM Institute)

50% of customers say they don’t share their bad or good service experiences through social media. (CFI Group)

33% of consumers would recommend a brand that provides a quick but ineffective response. (Nielsen-McKinsey)

78% of customers who complain to a brand on Twitter expect a response within an hour. (Lithium)

13% of customers tell 15 or more people if they have a negative experience. (Esteban Kolsky)

79% of customers who share their complaints online see their complaints ignored. (RightNow)

Only 17% of consumers would recommend a brand that provides a slow but effective solution. (Nielsen-McKinsey)

Only 1 in 26 customers will tell a business about their negative experience; according to customer service facts, the rest simply leave. (Esteban Kolsky)

That statistic about customers leaving without a word horrifies us every time! Consider how many negative responses you’ve had to CSAT or NPS surveys, then multiply it by 26 — scary, right?

Luckily, some pretty great current technologies make it a bit more straightforward to provide an excellent customer support experience and mine for nuggets of valuable insights as you do it.

Choosing the right support channels

Both phone and email are the tried and true channels of customer service. Back in the 1960s, when call banks first came about, customers started getting comfortable with having a direct line to support. Then came email, providing either a single address or a group email to reach customer service teams.

Now there’s live chat, co-browsing, virtual video calls, social media mentions, and tons of newly arriving methods for customers to reach out. Which one is best for your company? Take a look at the chart below to see different channels and how often each is used by support teams and customers:

Each channel has pros and cons. Here are some customer service statistics to help illuminate the positives and negatives for each and to help with your decision-making.

Omnichannel support

Omnichannel support is a continuous connection for customers between all of your channels. It effectively means that what someone does with a team on any channel can travel seamlessly to other channels with full context. For instance, your customer can start with a live chat and then transition seamlessly to a phone call as needed.

Omnichannel support provides an excellent experience for customers because it means that they never have to re-explain something they already told another member of your team. When done correctly, it can seem like magic:

75% of customers desire a consistent experience, regardless of how they engage a company (through social media, in person, by phone, etc.). (Salesforce)

64% of customers want to shop with companies that can meet their needs in real-time. (Salesforce)

64% of customer service teams use customer portals, compared to 84% of customers who use customer portals. (Salesforce)

As you can tell, timeliness, the ability to use multiple channels, and consistency are the main benefits of omnichannel.

Phone support

Phone support is one of the oldest forms of assistance. Since the invention of the rotary phone, companies and customers alike have depended on this valuable, reliable technology. Let’s take a look at some customer service statistics around teams using phones:

A study has shown that more than 76% of all consumers prefer the traditional medium of phone calls to reach customer support representatives. (CFI Group)

More than 50% of customers across all age groups typically use the phone to reach out to a service team, making it the most-used channel for customer service. (Zendesk)

63% of customer service teams use text messaging, compared to 78% of customers who use text messaging for communicating with a company. (Salesforce)

51% of customer service teams use mobile apps, compared to 82% of customers who use mobile apps for communicating with a company. (Salesforce)

Although support teams heavily use traditional phone support, it seems that there are still some tools they could use more. For instance, the number of customers who prefer text messaging and mobile apps compared with the number of customer service teams that use them leaves something to be desired.

Phone support is tried and true, but the opportunities available through mobile phones seems to still be a new frontier.

Self-service support

Documentation is beneficial for assisting customers without the need for your customer services team’s intervention. For example, a customer can search in your knowledge base and find answers within minutes which, in the long run, is a much better experience than having to wait for a response in an email or live chat queue.

Unfortunately, though, when documentation isn’t done well, it can do more harm than good. Here are some customer service statistics exploring both the good and bad sides of your help docs:

28% of consumers say the most frustrating issue is information that is simple but hard to find. (Drift)

69% of consumers first try to resolve their issue independently, but less than one-third of companies offer self-service options such as a knowledge base. (Zendesk)

Customers prefer knowledge bases over all other self-service channels. (Forrester)

66% of customer service teams use knowledge bases, compared to 82% of customers who use knowledge bases. (Salesforce)

As you can see, most customers would rather use a knowledge base/documentation to resolve their issues, but they aren’t always able to find them. Few companies have made efforts to create documentation, knowledge bases, or other options with which customers can serve themselves.

Social media support

Despite social media’s role as a place to connect with friends and coworkers, many businesses and consumers are using it to connect as well.

Functionality like Facebook and Instagram messaging have made it easy for users to connect directly with brands in a more meaningful and authentic way than they used to. Because of that, many companies are striving to create more presence in those environments.

These two customer service statistics around social media make it easy to understand why:

79% of American internet users are on Facebook, making it the most popular social media platform. (Lyfe Marketing)

95% of adults between the ages of 18-34 are likely to follow a brand through social media channels. (MarketingSherpa)

Think about all of the people your brand could connect with if you were to make the switch to providing customer service via social media channels?

Chat support

Chat is primarily considered to be the fastest way for consumers to get support. It feels immediate, can often be fielded by automation, and doesn’t always require a lot of bandwidth to staff. Similarly, many younger consumers prefer it over more traditional technology like phones.

If you haven’t already implemented chat within your team, here are two customer service statistics that may help you understand if it would be a good move:

Millennials prefer live chat for customer service over every other communication channel. (Comm100)

52% of customer service teams use online chat or live support, compared to 81% of customers who use online chat or live support for communicating with a company. (Salesforce)

There are many more customers who prefer to use live chat than companies who offer it! If you have the resources to implement it, chat may be an excellent opportunity to meet your customers where they are. Note that if your customers are searching for live chat and you don’t offer it, it may frustrate them even more.

Dealing with angry customers

“Our attitude towards others determines their attitude towards us.” –Earl Nightingale

Anger is a widespread and extremely difficult emotion to control. For example, one-third of people who responded to a survey about anger noted that they or someone they knew had a severe problem controlling their anger.

It may come as no surprise, then, that many of your customers, who are already in a stressful situation and need help, may become angry during an interaction.

Anger can be scary, but when you understand where it’s coming from and why it’s happening, it can be easier to handle. For example, many customer service team members could benefit from reminding themselves that the customer is angry about the situation that led them to the interaction, rather than the interaction itself.

For a few more reminders about anger within the context of customer service and how certain behaviors can lead to more profound customer anger, check out these customer service statistics:

21% of people waiting at a hospital pharmacy decided to fill their prescription elsewhere because they had to wait too long. (Sage Journals)

Nearly 70% of customers are irritated when their call is transferred from one department to another. (Zendesk)

Feeling unappreciated is the #1 reason customers switch products and services. (New Voice Media)

33% of customers are most frustrated by having to wait on hold, and 33% are most frustrated by having to repeat themselves to multiple support reps. (HubSpot Research)

70% of unhappy customers whose problems are resolved are willing to shop with a business again. (Glance)

Nearly 60% of customers feel that long holds and wait times are the most frustrating parts of a service experience. (Zendesk)

62% of customers would prefer to “hand out parking tickets” than wait in an automated phone tree for service or have to repeat themselves multiple times to different team members. (HubSpot)

35% of customers have become angry when talking to customer service. (American Express)

27% of Americans report that ineffective service is their number one customer service frustration. (Statista)

12% of Americans rate their number one service frustration as “lack of speed.” (Statista)

72% of customers say that explaining their problems to multiple people is poor customer service. (Dimensional Research)

79% of consumers who used online feedback to complain about a poor customer experience were ignored. (Harris Interactive)

84% of customers report that their expectations had not been exceeded in their last interaction with customer service. (Harvard Business Review)

78% of customers have given up on a transaction because of a negative customer experience. (American Express)

67% of customers end a call in frustration when they cannot reach a customer service representative. (Glance)

Most customer frustration seems to stem from waiting or having to repeat themselves. What are some ways you might be able to speed up support interactions or provide additional context for team members to work against these two common issues?

Putting some processes in place may help you work on these customer service statistics in the future. Preemptively addressing customer concerns and frustrations before they occur is a mark of a truly high-performing customer service organization.

Building a world-class support team

“In an era when companies see online support as a way to shield themselves from ‘costly’ interactions with their customers, it’s time to consider an entirely different approach: building human-centric customer service through great people and clever technology. So, get to know your customers. Humanize them. Humanize yourself. It’s worth it.” –Kristin Smoby

No matter how much we talk about anger, frustration, or disappointment, the fact remains that customer service teams do the brunt of the work to ensure your customers are happy and successful.

Unfortunately, customer service is often considered last when thinking about company policies, sharing information, or empowering teams. However, if these statistics have shown anything, it’s that customer service is essential and valuable to your customers.

Here are some of the best practices that top-of-their-class customer service people put into practice and how it makes their customers feel:

75% of consumers will still choose to interact with a real person even as the technology for automated solutions improves. (PwC)

One-third of all consumers consider the most critical aspect of good customer service experiences to be having their problem solved in one single interaction, regardless of the amount of time spent. (Statista)

88% of high-performing service decision-makers are investing significantly in agent training compared to only 57% of underperformers. (Salesforce)

83% of high-performing service agents say they get the training they need to do their job well compared to only 52% of underperformers. (Salesforce)

69% of high-performing service agents actively look for situations to use artificial intelligence (AI) compared to only 39% of underperformers. (Salesforce)

A whopping 95% of consumers say that customer service is essential for brand loyalty, and 60% of consumers report having deserted a brand and switching to a rival company because of poor customer service. (Microsoft Dynamics 365)

It seems like the main differentiator for performance is appropriate training and company trust — and consumers notice the difference. When you take care of your employees and ensure that they have the tools they need, they can better care for your customers.

Taking care of your support team

“Here is a simple but powerful rule: always give people more than what they expect to get.” –Nelson Boswell

The tide is shifting in business. Many companies realize that their best employees could be poached and go elsewhere for more pay and perhaps a better employee experience. Therefore, it’s essential to prioritize your customer service team members’ needs and address their priorities.

Below are a few customer service statistics that emphasize just how important the level of care that you provide is:

The customer service industry has the highest employee turnover rate of all businesses. Call center statistics have placed it as high as 45%! (QATC)

The Human Resource Institute estimates that turnover costs about $10k-$15k for a frontline employee. (QATC)

Most customer service reps don’t plan on staying in that job forever, as there are often poor growth opportunities. 31% of consumers consider a knowledgeable agent to be the most crucial factor for a positive customer experience. (Thomasnet)

Since 77% of consumers consider the difficulty of reaching an agent to be the biggest issue with customer service today, it’s worth investing in resolving it. (Review42)

89% of companies with ""significantly above average"" customer experiences perform better financially than their competitors. (Qualtrics XM Institute)

Great client support yields long-lasting results, too. 24% of consumers keep doing business with vendors for two or more years after a positive encounter. (Zendesk)

64% of U.S. consumers contacted customer service in 2017. (Aspect)

73% of customers say they stay loyal to brands because of friendly customer service agents. (HubSpot)

73% of customers fall in love with a brand because of friendly customer service representatives. (RightNow)

Consider those statistics, and imagine that you have six employees at the start of the year. By the end of the year, two or three of them will likely have left. That’s between $30k and $45k in expenses for losing employees who were likely doing an excellent job.

As we know, good customer service representatives can make or break customer relationships, so prioritizing the people who do good work is extremely important.

Consider what your customer service team needs more of, and try to find ways to offer it. Then speak directly to your team members about changes that you’ve made and the impact it has had on their quality of life. Ask them for their opinions, listen carefully, and then implement what you can.

Making a better working environment for your agents will create an excellent environment for your customers.

The impact of COVID-19

While it feels painful to talk about COVID-19, our lives have changed with the pandemic and its associated effects. As we speak of healthy environments for employees, it feels remiss not to talk about the impact that COVID-19 has had on the customer service industry.

The main trends are that customers are more challenging to please, more willing to switch to a company that aligns with their needs, and significantly less patient. We can’t blame them!

However, given these shifts, your customer service team may need to change their strategies to directly address the concerns that customers in this new world have (all of the following statistics are from HBR):

The typical level of difficult calls ranges from 10% to 20%, but the pandemic made customer experience statistics worse.

The average company saw the percentage of calls scored as ""difficult"" by reps increase by more than 100%.

There were more unexpected travel cancellations, appeals for bill payment extensions, insurance coverage disputes, and other anxiety-induced calls than any other historical time.

Customer service stats from 2020 show that reps feel like their job is much harder and less enjoyable.

Some of the companies in the study saw hold times grow by 34% and escalations increase by more than 68%, further highlighting the impact customer service has on businesses.

One of the Tethr AI study companies provided customer service statistics that showed difficult interactions had a 6% chance of resulting in an upsell or cross-sell. The chances are usually 80% when the customer service experience is excellent.

Only about 4% of customers who leave or threaten to leave are enticed to stay by accepting a promo, down from the average of 20% in the past.

Not only has COVID-19 impacted working environments and employees’ emotions, it’s affected customers in the same way. It’s much harder to connect with and solve problems for a customer who is burnt out and frazzled than it would be for a customer who feels secure and content.

Unfortunately, COVID-19 puts everyone in a stressful position, making it infinitely harder to connect on a human level and meet customers’ needs through support.

Hopefully all of those customer service statistics have given you a lot to consider and process. There are many different perspectives to consider and options to evaluate, but no matter what you’ve taken away from this post, we’re sure you’ll agree with this: Customer service is essential.

Not only is it essential, but it’s valuable to your bottom line and serves as a critical differentiator of your company against others.

If you treat every interaction as a way to get to know and love your customers, your team will be providing excellent customer service in no time.",preparing to open new office
638,12 Office Design Considerations That Will Increase Your ...,https://boweninteriors.com.au/office-design-considerations/,,"You’ve recently purchased a new office space and you’re planning the big move. As your to-do list continues to grow, many questions spring to mind.

How will you design your floor plan? What office furniture should you buy? How can you encourage team productivity in the new space?

The goal is to design an office that functions in harmony and inspires your team to succeed. In this article, we’ll walk you through twelve office design considerations to increase productivity in the workplace.

1. Working in an Open Floor Plan

As more organisations switch their focus to collaborative teamwork, office cubicles have declined in popularity. Instead, they’ve been replaced by open floor plans that promote more movement and allow team members to work side-by-side.

Create rows of open tables and desks, allowing colleagues to easily correspond. An open floor plan can also include:

Community sofas

Room dividers

Team recreation areas

This office layout aids in team centricity by allowing various departments to interact with one another throughout the day.

2. Reduce Clutter

Take steps to reduce office clutter by adding extra storage space and smaller tables. If you haven’t already done so, buy recycle bins and encourage your team to make the environmentally-friendly switch.

Evaluate which functions can become virtual. For instance, invest in an online task manager to reduce physical supplies. These efforts will reduce clutter, foster more open space, and improve productivity at work.

3. Allow Natural Lighting

Studies show that there’s a correlation between natural office lighting, employee satisfaction, and team productivity. We recommend placing tables and workstations closest to the windows.

Keep shades open throughout the day to maximize as much light as possible. Sheer type blinds instead of block out blinds are effective if shades are still required to reduce heat/glare, as they do not completely block the light. If used in moderation, the usage of mirrors also creates more natural light for team members in alternative locations.

4. Incorporate the Outdoors

In addition to natural lighting, use plants to further promote the outdoors. Plants will help clean and purify the air while brightening up your office space. Select low-maintenance plants that you can easily care for.

Avoid heavy pollinated plants that can cause allergic reactions. Instead, consider the following plant types:

Snake plant

Aloe vera

Oxalis

ZZ plants

You can also incorporate water elements in the workplace with fish tanks. Research different types of aquariums to select an appropriate style, size, and location.

Along with that, you’ll need to determine the types of fish that will be best suited for your office. Next, schedule consistent water changes for proper maintenance.

5. Select the Right Colours

The colour theme of your office should be a key part of your office design considerations, due to its psychological impact. The following colours are often most effective for productivity:

Blue

Blue represents calmness, patience, and honesty. Incorporate lighter shades of blue to help employees feel content and focused.

Green

Light green promotes balance, nature, and stability. Green also takes little to no vision adjustments, which makes it ideal for team members who work long hours.

Yellow

If you operate a creative-based practice, yellow is the colour that’s most associated with creativity. It’s also known for positivity, excitement, and confidence.

6. Use Designated Conference Rooms

Help increase your productivity at work by creating designated conference rooms. Consider both your company size and individual department sizes to determine the appropriate number of conference rooms.

Ensure that there are also enough conference rooms to go around, based on your company’s meeting cadence. To avoid confusion, grant your team access to a conference room booking system.

7. Minimize Noise

Excessive noise can be a large hindrance to easily-distracted team members. Instead, designate specific office areas for social interactions and autonomous work.

For social areas, consider:

Conference rooms

Team break rooms

Recreational rooms

Autonomous work zones can consist of:

Individual pods

Private wellness rooms

Office phone booths

Private work dens

8. Prioritize the Air Quality

In addition to plants, there are several other ways to improve the air quality in your office. These methods include but aren’t limited to:

Replacing air filters on a routine basis

Ensuring that air vents are unblocked

Clean air ducts regularly

Open windows for fresh air

On top of that, select a signature office scent. Steer clear of strong sugary scents, as these can overpower the workspace. Instead, try the following:

Citrus

Citrus has been linked to more physical energy and alertness. This will inspire proactive behaviours and increased team productivity.

Ginger

Ginger is known to combat fatigue. This scent is especially beneficial during dreary weather, lengthy meetings, or after-hour projects when employees often feel the most fatigued.

Lavender

Lavender is an excellent option for increasing concentration levels and reducing stress. This scent is also linked to mild pain reduction.

9. Purchase Sit-Stand Desks

Sit-Stand desks offer an array of health benefits for your team, such as increased energy and higher mood levels. Studies have shown that employees who stand more frequently throughout the day have lower risks of heart disease, obesity, and unhealthy blood-sugar levels.

Employees who sit for shorter increments also experience less back pain. Overall, sit-stand desks are one of our top office design tips for improving productivity and encouraging healthy work habits.

10. Display Artwork and Photographs

Allow your team to personalize their workspaces with family photographs to add a touch-of-home. You can incorporate wall art as well to brighten up shared spaces and lower stress levels.

Select artwork that demonstrates your brand mission and company culture. Showcase your mission statement as wall art in a prominent spot of your office for high visibility. Positive affirmations also make for impactful wall art in the workplace.

11. Showcase Your Team

Showcase your team’s accomplishments throughout your office in high-traffic areas. Has your team recently won an award or achieved a new milestone? Has your organization been recognized in the media?

Hang and frame your company’s achievements by the entranceway of the office, so that it’s the first thing your team sees each morning. This will remind them of their accomplishments and inspire them to reach new professional heights.

12. Create a Wellness Area

Design a specific area of your office that’s focused on health and well-being. The simplest way to do this is to stock your break room with an assortment of healthy snacks and beverages.

If you have an unused office room, convert the extra space into a designated employee wellness room. A wellness room should be quiet and free from technology, for employees to unwind, recharge, and de-stress. Provide sufficient space for stretching exercises, meditation, and yoga practices.

465,15 Growth Marketing Strategies that Work in 2024,https://www.growthcollective.com/blog/growth-marketing-strategies,4 дня назад,"Quick links:

A growth marketing strategy might sound like a redundant concept to brands in 2023.Â

After all, every marketing strategy is intended to help grow a business, so itâs easy to assume that all marketing is actually âgrowth marketing.âÂ

However, growth marketing is actually a very specific branch of the advertising world. It involves going beyond the basics of simply attracting customers toÂ the top of your funnelÂ of generating awareness. Instead,Â growth marketingÂ paves the way for sustainable development.

The challenge for many marketers is figuring out how to implement effective growth marketing strategies in a world where consumers, platforms, and advertising best practices are changing.

Knowing how to experiment and innovate with your marketing campaigns in an environment whereÂ marketing budgets are dwindlingÂ takes some serious creativity.Â

But, used effectively, growth marketing can help you not only grow your customer base but retain your crucial existing customers too.Â

Hereâs your guide to the growth marketing strategies that still pay dividends in 2023.

What is Growth Marketing?

Before we look at some of the best tactics for your growth marketing strategy in 2023, itâs worth taking a moment to define what growth marketing actually is.

Traditional marketing is an approach to promotion that focuses on short-term, campaign-oriented goals. More often than not, it focuses on the âtop of the funnel,â generating awareness and demand for products, services, and brands.Â

In traditional campaigns, companies review their approach to marketing on a regular, annual, or semi-annual basis, making changes gradually over time.

Growth marketing takes a more agile approach. With growth marketing, businesses focus on using data and insights to improve business outcomes throughout the entire customer journey.

The underlying idea is that by experimenting with different tactics, monitoring results, and taking a holistic view of the customer experience, businesses can achieve and retain consistent growth.

In a growth marketing strategy, companies add layers to their marketing campaigns, using A/B testing, cross-channel strategies, and innovative technology to unlock greater benefits.Â

Strategies forÂ growth marketingÂ evolve over time based on the evolution of industry trends, customer requirements, and new technology. This makes growth marketing a more effective way to stay one step ahead of the competition in your industry.Â

15 Growth Marketing Strategies for 2023

Notably, companies investing in growth marketing rarely focus on a single tactic.Â

One of the core pillars of growth marketing is constant experimentation. This means youâre likely to use a number of different strategies throughout the years to learn more about which campaigns are most likely to engage and convert your audience.Â

Today, weâre focusing specifically on the growth marketing strategies that are still driving results for businesses in 2023, despite the rise of things like ChatGPT and new search algorithms.

1. Full-Funnel Content MarketingÂ

Content marketingÂ isnât just a growth marketing strategy. AroundÂ 70% of B2C marketersÂ and 73% of B2B marketers are consistently using content to connect with their audience. The difference between a standard content marketing campaign and one tailored for growth is a holistic approach.Â

Rather than just looking for ways to draw attention to your brand, you think about how you can generate value for your customers throughout the entire customer journey, before, during, and after a purchase. This means mapping your customerâs journey from start to finish and creating content that appeals to every stage in the funnel.Â

A great example of this comes from HubSpot. The company focuses so heavily on content marketing youâre likely to find a web page on Google when searching virtually any marketing term. HubSpot produces blogs to appeal to every one of its customer segments, from sales professionals to service experts. It also explores a range of different types of content.Â

There areÂ free courses and certificationsÂ available which teach customers how to use the HubSpot tools more effectively after a purchase. Case studies show customers why they should consider buying HubSpot in the first place. While blogs and eBooks generate audience attention.

The company makes use of both paid and organic social media opportunities and even hosts regular webinars, which earnÂ thousands of registrationsÂ on a consistent basis.Â

2. Innovative Search Engine Optimization

Search engine optimizationÂ and content marketing generally go hand-in-hand. Even in a world where search engine algorithms are changing, thanks to the inclusion of generative AI technologies in search systems, SEO is still crucial for engaging and attracting leads.Â

SEO is a powerful growth strategy because it doesnât just help customers to find your products and services when theyâre in the early stages of the purchasing funnel. Good SEO will consistently help you to connect with your audience over time.Â

The higher your website ranks, the more authority youâll gain in the eyes of your consumers, increasing loyalty and retention. However, investing in SEO for the new age of marketing does require companies to take a slightly different approach.Â

Itâs not enough to simply choose the right keywords and post content constantly anymore. Companies need toÂ go in-depthÂ with their SEO strategies, focusing on user experience and value.Â Learning strategies like how to find hidden APIs can optimize your site resulting to faster and smoother UX.

In some cases, this also means adapting to new kinds of search strategies. There are more than 4.2 billionÂ voice assistantsÂ in the world as of 2023, and voice-based search is growing more common every day. Adapting your SEO strategy to include more natural language keywords could be crucial to generating growth in the years ahead.Â

A good way to do this is to find ways to answer common customer questions. An FAQ page, such as YouTubeâs clean, fresh, andÂ convenient FAQ section, is excellent for appealing to voice search engines. It even helps YouTube to rank at the top of the search engines for specific queries in featured âsnippetsâ on Google search results.Â

3. Community Building

Communities have emerged as an essential part of the digital landscape in recent years. TheÂ rise of social media, combined with increasing interest in sites like Reddit, is pushing companies to invest more heavily in ways to engage and consistently connect with customers.Â

Building a community for your customers is a fantastic way to make sure your customers feel more invested in your brand. It forms emotional connections that lead to better customer retention, longer lifecycles, and even the creation of brand ambassadors and advocates.Â

An excellent example of the power of communityÂ comes from GitHub, the developer platform that built community elements directly into its product offering. GitHub encourages coders to come together to work on projects and solve problems in an open environment.

There are contribution-tracking features, options for following projects, and even competitions and challenges hosted on the platform, to bring people closer together. Itâs this approach to community development that helped GitHub to earn more than 100,000 users within its first year.Â

Whatâs more, GitHubâs community environment provides the company with an in-depth insight into its target audience. Nurturing your community is an excellent way to learn more about the problems they face, the goals they want to accomplish, and the issues they need to solve.Â

4. Referral Programs

Speaking of activating your audience, referral programs represent one of the most powerful and useful growth marketing strategy options in the world today. As customers become more desensitized towards traditional marketing methods, theyâre becoming more reliant on the opinions of others.

In fact, 92% of customers say they trust referrals from people they know. Referral marketing is your opportunity to take advantage of the enduring power ofÂ word-of-mouth advertising.Â

An excellent and frequently referenced example of the power of referral marketing comes from Dropbox. Instead of rewarding users with financial incentives when they sent a referral to the business, the company offered increased storage space.Â

Every friend who introduced a new user to Dropbox would receive an extra 500MB of free storage, with a limit of around 16GB. This program was so successful itÂ drove a 3900% growthÂ in just 15 months. Dropbox enhanced the impact of its referral program by offering two-way rewards (For both users) and even adding referral options to its onboarding process.Â

Another example comes fromÂ Sephoraâs BeautyÂ program, which consistently rewards customers not just for referrals but also for actions like simply making a purchase.

5. Leveraging Customer Psychology

Growth marketing is often aÂ combination of art and science. Itâs about connecting with your audience on a deeper level, leveraging their emotions, interests, and sometimes even their fears.Â

In todayâs complex economy, buyer cycles are growing longer all the time. Customers are increasingly concerned about making the âwrong choiceâ with their purchase, so theyâre much slower to make a purchase. This can lead to a lot of abandoned carts and lost sales.Â

Leveraging customer psychology is an excellent way to push people to act faster. For instance, countless companies use âFear of Missing Outâ or âFOMOâ tactics on their store or website to create a sense of urgency among their consumers.Â

Visit Booking.com, and youâll notice the company constantly draws attention to how many rooms, apartments, or bookings are available at any given time. Amazon takes a similar approach, showing how many items are left in stock at any given time.Â

In 2023, there are plenty of new ways to implement FOMO into your marketing campaigns, from using dynamic alerts on your website to show when other customers make a purchase to running limited-time sales and discounts.Â

6. Hyper-Personalization

AroundÂ 99% of marketersÂ say that personalization helps them to build stronger relationships with customers. Since the best growth marketing strategy will always focus on both customer acquisition and retention, this makes personalization a key tool for any business leader.Â

Thanks to a variety of data collection tools and emerging AI solutions capable of adapting product suggestions and recommendations to customer needs, itâs never been easier to implement personalization into your marketing strategy.Â

Netflix, Amazon, and Walmart all use generative AI to recommend solutions to their audience based on previous purchases, browsing history, search terms, and other factors. Another excellent example comes from Spotify. The music-sharing company takes advantage of the data that customers are willing to share about their listening habits.

Using machine learning models, Spotify recommends new tracks to users based on their listening history, turning its platform into a âdiscoveryâ environment for music lovers. The company even runs regular âSpotify-wrappedâ campaigns to highlight customersâ listening habits for them.

This not only leads to a more personalized experience for customers but it also ensures Spotify has a way to encourage customers to share their Spotify experiences with others. In 2020, Spotify wrapped increased the companyâs mobile app downloads byÂ around 21%Â in just one week.Â

7. Re-Engagement Campaigns

A growth marketing strategy should help you to maintain your connection with your existing customers for as long as possible, increasing customer lifetime value and revenue. According to one study, a company can increase itsÂ growth by 50%Â just by minimizing its churn rate.Â

Re-engagement strategies are relatively easy to implement in todayâs world. You can experiment with retargeting campaigns across paid advertising platforms like Facebook and Google, designed to draw customers back to your site. Email marketing automation tools make it easy to send cart abandonment messages to customers with personalized recommendations.

There are even CRM tools that can help you track engagement levels among your consumers so you know instantly which segments need further attention. Groove used behavioral segmentation to identify people who have gone dormant in their subscriber list and reduced theirÂ churn rate to 1.6%.Â

Old Navy is an excellent example of a company using re-engagement tactics to its advantage. When customers stop clicking on email campaigns and making purchases, they send messages asking customers to update their email preferences, so they can send more valuable content. They also ask customers for their birth date in exchange for a free treat on their birthday.

8. Event Marketing

As the digital world grows more crowded and consumers seek more emotional connections following the pandemic, event marketing has become increasingly popular. According to some studies, 48% of brandsÂ achieve ROIs of up to 500%Â with the right event campaigns.Â

Event marketing can be particularly useful for business owners who want to achieve growth in the B2B landscape. AroundÂ 97% of B2B marketersÂ believe live events have a significant impact on their business outcomes.Â

Events deliver a number of benefits to businesses searching for growth. They offer an opportunity to connect with customers in a more face-to-face environment than most advertising campaigns. Plus, theyâre a great way to demonstrate thought leadership.Â

In todayâs world, events donât have to be in-person to deliver excellent results. AroundÂ 93% of event marketersÂ say theyâre planning on hosting virtual events going forward, which include online video streams, webinars, conferences, and even AR and VR-based events.Â

For instance, theÂ Microsoft teamÂ runs a host of regular events, both in-person and online, for anyone to attend. Each event is tailored to the needs of a specific audience, from business leaders to developers and even everyday consumers.Â

The events give the company an opportunity to network, exchange e-business cards, and share updates about its latest releases and products, as well as a way to build buzz about business news.

9. Disruptive Marketing

As mentioned above, many growth marketing strategies focus on experimentation. Sometimes, generating rapid growth means finding ways to think outside of the box and connect with your customers on a different level. Disruptive marketing is all about flipping the script with traditional marketing techniques, using experiential experiences and new technology.Â

While the initial results of disruptive marketing campaigns may be short-lived, theyâre an excellent way to demonstrate thought leadership and build excitement around your brand. Disruptive marketing can also be a powerful way to set yourself apart from the competition.

The key to disruptive marketing is to find ways of reaching your audience that havenât been done before. A great example comes from Netflix, which knows how to connect with its audience both online and offline. After the success ofÂ Squid Game in 2022, Netflix began installing âred light, green lightâ dolls in various locations around the world to celebrate the renewal of its popular show.

The dolls interacted with people, allowing them to win prizes if they were able to complete the game successfully. This gave Netflix an excellent opportunity to build hype for a show that would only be released again a year later.Â

10. Influencer Marketing

The rise of the creator economy in recent years has only madeÂ influencer marketingÂ more powerful. As mentioned above, todayâs consumers are looking for guidance from reputable sources to help them determine which products and solutions they should buy.Â

By 2025, influencer marketing is set to have a value ofÂ around $24.1 billionÂ as more companies partner with innovators to help them reach their target audience. TikTok and Instagram have even launched creator marketplace tools, making it easier for brands to collaborate on campaigns.Â

Investing in influencer marketing for growth in 2023 will require companies to take a slightly different approach. Thereâll be a greater focus on micro-influencers and more natural, authentic content in the years ahead.Â

Instead of simply paying celebrities to support pre-designed campaigns, business leaders will need to think about how they can collaborate with influencers more effectively to create content.Â

For instance,Â Fashion NovaÂ has grown its brand considerably over the years, thanks to its investment in influencer marketing. The company has around 5,000 influencers working with it to share content that feels authentic, realistic, and natural. In fact, the marketing strategy has been so successful for the brand; the company managed to sell more than $500 million in 2021 alone.

11. Empowering Existing Customers

Since a strong growth marketing strategy focuses on customers throughout their entire purchasing lifecycle, itâs important for brands to think about how they can empower existing users. Traditional marketing efforts only concentrate on capturing sales.Â

However, effective growth marketing efforts look for ways to delight and engage customers after theyâve made a purchase. Creating a powerful onboarding strategy, leveraging concepts like gamification, can be an excellent way to increase the customer lifetime value of each of your consumers and improve your results over time.Â

Teaching customers how to use your products with the right onboarding strategy means theyâre more likely to feel loyal and committed to your brand. A good way to get started is to evaluate the issues your customers might have with your product or service, then create an onboarding program that allows them to seamlessly address those concerns.Â

For instance, the Shine company boasts an onboarding completionÂ rate of around 80%Â by providing customers with progress bars to help them move through the process and offering step-by-step guidance every step of the way. They even shower their customers in digital confetti when they complete a stage of the onboarding process.Â

12. Social Proof

Weâve already mentioned that customers are relying more heavily on input from other consumers to help them make purchases these days. They want to see genuine evidence that every company they work with can actually deliver the results theyâre looking for. Thatâs where social proof comes in.

Social proof in your growth marketing strategy makes it easy for customers to make intelligent purchases, using reviews, quotes, and testimonials to guide them. You can generate social proof in a range of ways, from using branded hashtags to encourage user-generated content to recruit brandÂ ambassadors and influencersÂ to work with your company.Â

One excellent example of a company that knows how to leverage the power of social proof comes from Airbnb. The company found around half of its guests generally visit a host profile at least once before making a booking. A host without reviews was four times less likely to get a booking.

With these insights,Â Airbnb decidedÂ to make it easier for consumers to leave reviews. Using a double-blind review system, Airbnb allows visitors to review the hosts they book with, but it also encourages hosts to review their customers. The parties are also both encouraged to write a review within 14 days so the experience is still fresh in their mind.

13. Using Freebies to Increase Sales

Everyone loves getting something for free. As consumers become more concerned about how they spend their money, theyâre increasingly looking for ways to ensure theyâre going to get a good deal before they pay for anything.Â

Product demos and free trials can be an excellent way for companies to drive growth, particularly in the SaaS industry. With a âfreemiumâ product strategy, organizations give their customers a chance to trail their product or service, see its benefits, and develop an interest in the solution.Â

For instance, True North gives companies access to aÂ free trialÂ of its growth marketing platform, where they can access all of the most valuable tools the business has to offer. The idea is that by the end of the trial, customers will be so reliant on the software they wonât want to lose it.Â

Free tools can also be an excellent way to showcase the credibility and value of a business. For instance, CrazyEgg offers a range of free tools customers can access to help with keyword research and other marketing tactics. All they need to give in exchange is their email address, which means the company accesses leads it can nurture in the future. In a similar vein, if you're operating an online shirt printing business, offering a free design tool can hook potential customers.

14. Solving Problems

The businesses that grow the fastest, and retain their growth the longest, are generally the ones that can actually solve crucial problems for their target audience. Most companies start with a focus on a specific pain point that they want to address for their target audience.Â

However, as your customers evolve and the market grows, you may find the priorities of your buyers change over time. Thatâs why itâs so important to invest in consistently collecting data from your customers in the form of a consistent feedback loop. Asking customers to share their concerns, issues, and problems with you on a regular basis can drive amazing opportunities for growth.Â

With feedback from customers, businesses can invest in new strategies and solutions that set them apart from the competition and ensure ongoing loyalty. For instance,Â Microsoft is constantlyÂ upgrading its Teams platform based on feedback from its community.Â

The company creates open platforms and environments where customers can ask questions, request new products, and even track the innovation timeline of the business. Using this strategy, Microsoft is able to constantly stay up to date on what its customers really need.Â

Microsoftâs feedback loop and approach to problem-solving have turned Teams into one of the most popular apps of all time, with more thanÂ 280 million monthlyÂ active users as of 2023.Â

15. Cross-Channel Marketing

Finally, one of the best ways to enhance your growth marketing strategy in 2023 is to expand beyond the basics of your marketing mix. Digital transformation offerings have accelerated in the last few years, leading to customers finding a host of new ways to connect with their favorite brands and enhance their purchasing journey. They expect companies to take a multi-channel approach to engagement.Â

With cross-channel marketing, you connect with customers on all of the channels they use on a regular basis, using tools like SMS messaging, push notifications, in-app messages, social media, direct email, and other channels. This ensures you can connect with your audience regardless of where they are and maintain a relationship over time.Â

The key to success with cross-channel marketing is understanding where your customers actually interact with your industry and your business. Mapping the customer journey with data analytics and insights will allow you to determine touchpoints for growth.Â

For instance, Mercedez Benz has a fantastic cross-channel marketing strategy that combines paid, owned, and earned media with aÂ community-building strategy. The company also ensures its connection with its customers on social media, using key influencer campaigns.Â

The company usesÂ branded hashtags on InstagramÂ and micro-influencer accounts to connect with customers on a deeper level and keep them up to date on product releases.Â

Bonus Tip: Constantly Track and Measure

With every growth marketing strategy mentioned above, business leaders should be able to not only increase their access to new customers but retain more of their existing buyers. However, itâs important to remember that growth marketing requires consistent work.Â

With growth marketing, you donât just implement a campaign and then review your results several months later. You need to be committed to constantly collecting data from every campaign and experimenting with different strategies.Â

Constant A/B testing is essential to a strong growth marketing strategy. Youâll need to experiment with your content, your marketing methods, and even the targeting tools you use to ensure youâre getting the best ROI from each campaign.Â

Growth marketing requires an investment in constant measurement and the use of the right KPIs and metrics to track the results of your efforts. Make sure youâre investing in the right tools to ensure you can constantly analyze the outcomes of your campaigns.Â

More importantly, make sure youâre willing to make changes rapidly based on the results you gather. Donât be afraid to experiment constantly to upgrade your results.Â

Choosing the Right Growth Marketing Strategy for 2023

Growth is something every business wants to achieve. While itâs not the only metric worth monitoring when youâre building your company, itâs something you should constantly focus on with your marketing efforts. Investing in the right growth marketing strategy could be crucial to unlocking the true potential of your business and connecting with new and existing customers.Â

The methods outlined above are all tried-and-tested examples of growth marketing strategies that can help you to form deeper relationships with your target audience and increase your revenue. Used correctly, they can ensure you not only achieve your growth goals but maintain exceptional growth for years to come.Â

634,3 Reasons Why Office Space Planning is Important,https://www.nhcsllc.net/blog/office-space-planning/,,"3 Reasons Why Office Space Planning is Important

Businesses are constantly evolving whether it’s through re-organization, downsizing or expansion. And many office spaces and commercial establishments may not be as efficient as they could. This often impacts the way employees work and communicate in the workplace.

What can you do as a business owner to maximize productivity and efficiency? One effective solution is better office space planning. Let’s look at the importance of office space planning and how you can use it to get the most out of your business.

Boost Employee Productivity

A well-planned office space can boost productivity. A cramped and cluttered office environment makes employees feel overwhelmed leading to a loss in morale. Maximizing the use of space with the right furniture enables employees to better focus on their job function. Even if you have a small office, a little planning goes a long way to creating a more productive working environment. For instance, some employee job descriptions may require privacy. For others, collaboration is best. That’s where proper office planning comes into play. It allows you to create an office environment that maximizes efficiency and productivity.

Better Use of Existing Space

By taking the time to plan your office, you can find new and better ways of working together; ways you may never imagined. For instance, you may have space constraints due to haphazardly placed furnishings. Or, you may find that you have too many work desks grouped together that are causing privacy concerns. You can evaluate the space and install furniture, partitions and other furnishings that best fits your space while creating extra room for other important needs. You can find and open any under-utilized areas, and allocate space for office equipment, additional work areas, private offices, and other uses. You can also hire a commercial contractor with experience in office space planning to improve your current working environment. By remodeling an inefficient office, you can create a workspace where employees can freely interact with each other, share ideas and boost morale.

Increased Health and Safety of Employees

Studies have proven that an office with poor lighting and ventilation can cause headaches and drowsiness leading to worker fatigue, low morale and sick days. In fact, more than two-thirds of employees participating in an American Society of Interior Design study indicated that lighting was a problem in their office. That’s why its important that any type of office planning consider lighting in the office. Offices should be planned in such a way that it delivers optimal lighting for employees throughout the work day. One quick fix is to replace any traditional incandescent fixtures with LED lighting. This will not only save the company thousands of dollars per year on energy costs but will keep the office temperature considerably cooler. Also, LED lights more closely resemble natural light which can help to reduce eye strain and fatigue while boosting productivity and morale. In addition, office planning should also consider the impact of the colors and noise level on the current office environment and consider changes that will optimize productivity.

But we promise, making a 30-60-90 day plan is possible and it can help you set yourself up for success at your new gig. We’ve got detailed instructions on when and how to make a 30-60-90 day plan, plus a template to guide you and an example to inspire you.

What is a 30-60-90 day plan?

A 30-60-90 day plan is what it sounds like: a document that articulates your intentions for the first 30, 60, and 90 days of a new job. It lists your high-level priorities and actionable goals, as well as the metrics you’ll use to measure success in those first three months. Done well, it will help you make a positive first impression on your new employer—or the hiring manager you hope will be your future boss. Download The Muse’s 30-60-90 day plan template here.

When to make a 30-60-90 day plan

Many 30-60-90 day plans follow a similar structure, but the level of detail may vary depending on your situation. There are two main times when you might make one: preparing for an interview or starting a new job. Note: If you’re a manager who wants to make an onboarding plan to help your new hires hit the ground running (without constantly having to ask you what they should do next), you should consider using our self-onboarding tool, a template for outlining your month-one goals for a new hire, as well as creating a week-by-week plan with a thorough list of meetings, readings, and tasks they should tackle in their first month on the job. For an interview If you’ve made it to a late-stage job interview, you may be asked something along the lines of, “What would your first 30, 60, or 90 days look like in this role?” It’s a good idea to prepare to answer this regardless of what level role you’re interviewing for, but it’s more common for higher-level positions. With interview questions like this, the hiring manager is likely trying to understand your thought process going into the job more than anything. They want to know: Do you understand the role and what it would require of you? Can you get up to speed quickly and start contributing early on? Do your ideas show that you’re the right candidate to fill this particular position? Even if you’re not explicitly asked this interview question, coming prepared with a plan can help you wow the hiring manager and stand out among other applicants. “Employers are looking for people who are agile and proactive,” says leadership consultant Michael Watkins, author of The First 90 Days: Proven Strategies for Getting Up to Speed Faster and Smarter. “By talking about how you would approach your first 90 days, you demonstrate agility and proactiveness.” In other cases—more commonly for higher-level management or executive roles—you may be asked to do an interview presentation. Creating a 30-60-90 day plan to present is a great way to show the hiring manager that you understand the challenges a company or department is facing and you have a clear plan for tackling them. Be sure to include a few specific ideas in your interview presentation—depending on the role you’re interviewing for, that could be suggestions for ways to cut costs, increase sales, or improve customer satisfaction. You want to convey: “I’ve got five good ideas, and when you hire me, I’ve got 50 more,” says career coach Eliot Kaplan, who spent 18 years as Vice President of Talent Acquisition at Hearst Magazines. For a new job If you’re starting a new job, your new manager may explicitly ask for a 30-60-90 day plan in writing, or you may want to create one for yourself to help ease the transition to your new role. In either case, the goal is to set yourself up to hit the ground running—and to be sure you’re running in the right direction. “If you come in without a game plan and try to tackle everything, you’re going to get nothing done,” Kaplan says. “Come up with a couple things you can accomplish successfully.” If you’ve already started the position, you’ll have access to internal resources and your new coworkers, which will make it easier to create a detailed, realistic plan. If there are things you’re unsure about—like goals, expectations, or typical benchmarks—ask! You’ll likely impress your new colleagues with how proactive you are, but more importantly, you’ll gather the information you need to be successful.

Elements of a 30-60-90 day plan

Before you’re ready to get down to the details of your 30-60-90 plan, you’ll want to think about the high-level elements it needs to include. As the name suggests, you want to think of your plan in three 30 day phases that translate to your first 30, 60, and 90 days on the job. For each phase, you’ll need to: Determine a specific focus

Set your top priorities

Make concrete goals that support those priorities

Determine how you’ll measure success Here’s how to fill in the major parts of your plan for each of the first three months: Focus Your specific monthly focus might change based on your role and the company, but typically, the broad focus of each 30-day period will look similar: The first month (days 1-30) of a new job is about learning.

The second month (days 31-60) is about planning and beginning to contribute

The third month (days 61-90) is about execution and—when applicable—initiating changes to the status quo. Priorities Within those broad monthly buckets, outline your high-level priorities for each phase. For instance, your priorities for different phases could include learning internal processes, performing your role independently, or proposing solutions to a problem facing the company. Your priorities should be more specific than your focuses, but broader than individual goals. Goals Setting goals is all about making a plan for how you’ll achieve your overarching priorities. For each phase, set goals that ladder up to your stated focus and priorities. (See our example 30-60-90 day plan below for inspiration.) If it’s helpful, break your goals into categories like learning, performance, and personal goals. Learning goals: To set these, ask, “What knowledge and skills do I need to be successful? How can I best absorb and acquire that information and those abilities?”

To set these, ask, “What knowledge and skills do I need to be successful? How can I best absorb and acquire that information and those abilities?” Performance goals: These are concrete things you want to accomplish or complete as part of your new role. To set these, ask yourself, “What progress do I hope to make within the first 30/60/90 days?”

These are concrete things you want to accomplish or complete as part of your new role. To set these, ask yourself, “What progress do I hope to make within the first 30/60/90 days?” Personal goals: These goals are more about getting to know the people you’ll be working with and finding your place within your new company or team. To set these, ask, “Who are the key people I need and want to build relationships with? How can I establish and foster those relationships, so that I’m seen as trustworthy and credible?” Metrics For each goal, determine at least one metric you’ll use to track your progress. Ask yourself, “What does success look like and how will I measure it?” Not sure how to do that? Keep reading!

6 tips for writing a 30-60-90 day plan

So how do you figure out your focus, priorities, goals, and metrics for a brand new role? You’ll need to gain a deeper understanding of the challenges that the company or department is trying to solve and reflect on how you can make a positive impact within the first 90 days. Here are six tips to make that easier: 1. Think big picture. Before you start writing out specific goals and metrics, reflect on your overall priorities. “Start with what’s important to you and work out from there,” says Muse career coach Yolanda Owens. “What are the things you’re going to need to know in order to be successful? Use [those] as your compass.” Identify why they hired (or are looking to hire) you, and set priorities that deliver on that purpose. For mid- and high-level roles, you’re likely being brought in to solve a specific problem or lead a particular project. For more junior roles, your priority can be getting up to speed on the basics of your role and how the company works. 2. Ask questions. Whether you’re new to a company or still in the interview stage, asking questions is crucial. In order to set realistic goals and metrics that ladder up to your high-level priorities, you’ll need a baseline understanding of the status quo. Ask things that start with, “What’s the average…” or “What’s typical for…” You can ask your new coworkers these questions or use early stage interviews to ask questions that could help you make a 30-60-90 day plan later on. Muse career coach Tamara Williams suggests asking up front, “What can I tackle in the first 90 days that will allow me to hit the ground running as well as make a significant impact in the organization?” 3. Meet with key stakeholders. Establishing healthy working relationships is key to success in any role. If you’ve already started the job, set up meetings with the following people within the first 30 days: Your manager

Other coworkers on your team with whom you’ll work closely

Other colleagues who are in your role or a similar one

Any cross-functional partners (on other teams) you’ll work with regularly

Any external partners (outside of the company) you’ll work with regularly

Your new direct reports (if you’re a manager) In each meeting, learn about your coworkers’ roles within the company—and also get to know them as people. Ask lots of questions about the company culture, internal processes, reporting structures, team and company challenges, and other questions that come up as you’re learning the ropes. It’s important to have these conversations before you make plans to change the way things are currently run. “Too many times, [people] come into the role and say, ‘At my last company, we did it this way,’” Williams says. “That turns people off. You need to be a student before you become a teacher.” 4. Set SMART goals. Once you’re clear on your high-level priorities, set specific goals that ladder up to your priorities for the 30-, 60-, and 90-day phases. These goals should be SMART: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound. For example, instead of “Understand our SEO,” a SMART goal would be, “Within the first 30 days, identify our top 10 target keywords and assess how we’re currently ranking for them.” 5. Determine how you’ll measure success. This will likely be different for each of your goals. Metrics are often quantifiable (revenue, pageviews, etc.), but some goals might have more qualitative metrics, like positive customer feedback. However, try to make even qualitative metrics measurable—for instance, the number of five-star reviews you receive. 6. Be flexible. Don’t worry if you don’t end up following the plan precisely. Every job is different, so tailor your plan based on what you know about the role and organization, but accept that it will likely change. Ask for feedback throughout your first 90 days (and throughout your tenure at the company). If you have to course-correct as you go, that’s totally fine. If you’re a team lead or executive, consider adding, “Conduct a SWOT analysis of my project, team, the department or the company as a whole,” to your plan during month two or three. SWOT simply stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Once you complete this exercise it might help you adjust the rest of your plan as well as set longer-term goals and strategies. Also, don’t stress about the length of your written plan—it’s the quality that counts, Kaplan says. “I've gotten [90-day plans] that were two pages long and were perfect, and ones that were 40 pages long and were useless.”

348,4 Easy Steps For an Easy Dental Office Design Expansion,https://hjtdesign.com/easy-dental-office-design-expansion/,,"4 Easy Steps For an Easy Dental Office Design Expansion

Posted by HJT Design

The dental profession clearly is on the upswing as demand for dentists continues to grow. You, as a dentist, have enjoyed enough success to the point that you are ready to expand your office to bring in even more business.

The expansion of a dental office design can be a complicated issue. As more equipment and space gets added, there are more decisions you must make to help ensure continued growth in your business. There are many different things to consider such as how long of a process it would be, so it could be better to consult those who have experience with helping a dental office grow and bring in more business.

Otherwise, an office expansion usually falls into four steps.

Step 1: Make sure the Time is Right

The first step is to understand when you should and can expand the office. Usually, a dental practice goes through an initial growing phase where it builds up its clients list and reaches capacity. Once it hits that capacity, growth slows to almost a trickle and a dentist can’t plan ahead much due to a constantly full schedule. That leads to a stagnation or a period where the dental office is simply comfortable with who and what it has.

For those who are looking at an office expansion, knowing when the time is right is a crucial first step. Before you do so, make sure you are maximizing the profit potential of your current office. That could involve reorganizing how the business is run or applying more updated computer or tech systems. If you have believed profit capacity has been reached even there, then it is time to expand.

Step 2: Analyze How to Expand and What it Costs

You are expanding the dental practice, but how? Recognize whether this is an actual expansion or a remodeling would work. Also, see if there is available nearby space to properly expand.

Expanding usually means adding additional square footage of office space in order to install more base dental equipment. Sometimes, that means adding a new tech room to keep the practice up to date with modern advances in the field.

Eventually, expanding the practice comes down to cost and dollars are still a finite commodity. Ultimately, you need to maximize the expansion potential financially

Step 3: The Plans Must Stay True to Your Overall Office Culture and Theme

The field of dentistry is broader than many people imagine and every dentist has a select field, practice, or client group they cater to. Some are a children’s dentist. Others do family practice or specialize in tooth extraction or implants. Make sure your specialty niche is central to the expansion plans.

Also, office culture and personality can’t be lost in the transition. If you bill your practice as friendly and supportive of clients, expanding the waiting room or providing more space to the receptionist area are options.

Step 4: Keep the Business Operating During the Expansion

You can’t make any money if the dental business isn’t open while the office reconfiguration is ongoing. Therefore, the plan needs to be put in place in order for the office to stay open during its regular hours.

It is estimated that an office remodel or expansion can take anywhere from a week to two months depending on how ambitious the plans are. Closing the doors for an extended period time could amount of lost income. While it possible to limit working hours, a phased plan usually is the best option for the time period.

All of these factors must be considered before your office expansion begins. If you have questions, or need advice, contact HJT Design today.",future office expansion plans
224,5 Considerations Before Renewing Your Office Space,https://santosknightfrank.com/blogs/5-considerations-before-renewing-your-office-space/,,"





OSCA, Residential, Investment

For many businesses, an office is a must-have. Although our experience of the pandemic clearly demonstrated that the business climate can change quickly. Before you know it, the business may have grown out of the space, or your landlord is raising the rent. We have previously tackled a checklist for leasing but before you get there, here are five considerations to think about before renewing your office space.

Operations

Before renewing your office space, it is crucial to have an organized and optimized operation as this exhibits a well-run business. So, how are your current business operations? Is your office open during regular hours only or run a 24/7 operation? Are you upscaling or downsizing? What do you need the office space for? These simple questions relate to how your business should operate in the near future and can paint a picture of whether your current office space is sufficient or not.

Role of the office in future plans

Once you have identified your current operations, figure out what role the office will play in your future business plans. Are you looking to increase your workforce or downsize the team? Has the company completely transitioned to a work hybrid model? Do you plan to have the entire team return back to work? Or make use of the hub and spoke office model?

The key here is to identify the employee headcount who will report to the office, where the meetings will be held, a training room for team members, and an area for in-house office storage. Companies also consider other shared areas such as an office pantry as this is a place for office gatherings to encourage collaboration and boost employee morale. The office spaces play a vital role in the business’ culture so thinking about what kind of space you need based on your company’s culture must also be considered.

Relationship with the landlord

Your relationship with the landlord is also a contributing factor in having a quality experience as a tenant. It not only helps your business but makes your life much easier when planning to renew your office space. To do this, you need to maintain a balance that is favorable to both sides so that it is easy to come up with an agreement.

Area

Another thing you need to do before renewing your office is area planning. You need to know the basics of the kind of office space you want. Given the current direction of your company, does the current surrounding office or building still speak to your brand?

Keep in mind that an office is your brand’s visible mark or identity. So, if you find the current location no longer suits the corporate branding, then it might be time to rethink the space.

Price

Given that expenses have already been incurred in your current office, would the cost of transferring to another office space be worth it? If transferring to a new office space is really the right direction for the business, this will could garner increased income from the scaled-up operation. However, cutting building lease costs is also a cost saver for the business.

Finding your next office space

Now that you know what things to consider, it is time to find the right office space.

248,5 Essential Factors to Consider When Purchasing ... - All Office,https://www.alloffice.co.za/blog/what-to-consider-when-buying-new-office-furniture-for-your-office/,,"The office environment plays a vital role in shaping employee productivity, satisfaction, and overall well-being. An essential aspect of this environment is the choice of office furniture that occupies the space. It’s not just about appearances or filling an empty space; it’s about ensuring that each piece contributes positively to daily operations and enhances worker comfort, which in turn benefits the company as a whole. From ergonomic considerations to budget, there are multiple factors to navigate when deciding on office furniture. In this guide, we’ll delve into the five key areas every business should evaluate to make an informed decision, ensuring that every piece of office furniture adds value in more ways than one.

Table Of Contents

2. Durability and Quality When furnishing an office space, it might be tempting to cut corners and opt for the cheapest available options. However, when it comes to office furniture, the old adage often rings true: “You get what you pay for.” Investing in durable and high-quality furniture is not just a matter of aesthetics or prestige—it’s about long-term value, functionality, and overall cost savings. Durability in office furniture translates to pieces that can withstand the daily rigours of office life. Think of the countless times drawers are opened and closed, office chairs are swivelled around, or desks bear the weight of hefty equipment. Quality furniture is built to endure these repeated stresses without faltering, ensuring that replacements or repairs aren’t frequent necessities. Several indicators can help determine the quality of a piece of furniture:

Furniture Material Hardwoods, metal joints, high-grade plastics, and other sturdy materials often signify a piece built to last. Furniture Finish A quality finish, whether it’s paint, varnish, or laminate, protects the furniture from spills, stains, and scratches. Furniture Craftsmanship Tight joints, smooth edges, and the absence of any wobbling or creaking are signs of superior craftsmanship.

Remember, every time a piece of furniture breaks or wears out prematurely, it’s not just the cost of replacement that affects the business. There’s also the downtime, potential disruptions, and even the risk of injury to consider. Moreover, quality furniture often comes with better ergonomic designs and aesthetics. It can enhance the look and feel of the office, creating an environment that employees are proud to work in and that leaves a lasting impression on clients and visitors.

3. Employee Health and Wellness The well-being of employees is paramount to the success of any business. Beyond the obvious ethical implications, numerous studies have shown that a healthy, happy workforce leads to enhanced productivity, reduced absenteeism, and even boosts in creativity. In this light, it’s evident that office furniture plays a pivotal role in promoting employee health and wellness.

Physical Health While we’ve touched upon ergonomics, its influence on physical health bears repeating. Inadequate office furniture can lead to a plethora of musculoskeletal problems, from back pains and neck strains to more severe conditions like carpal tunnel syndrome. Such issues not only lead to discomfort but also frequent medical leaves and long-term health implications. However, physical health isn’t just about preventing injury. It’s also about promoting active movement. Innovations like sit-stand desks encourage employees to change their postures throughout the day, reducing the risks associated with prolonged sitting. The incorporation of footrests, appropriate lighting to reduce eye strain, and even plants for better air quality can all play a role in creating a health-enhancing environment.

Mental Well-being The psychological impact of the office environment is equally crucial. A cluttered desk might lead to increased stress, while a well-lit, spacious workstation can uplift moods. Furniture that provides personal storage solutions can help reduce clutter, while breakout areas with comfy seating can serve as spaces for relaxation and informal interactions, fostering a sense of community.

4. Convenience: Space Utilisation and Flexibility In the contemporary office landscape, every square inch counts. As businesses grow and evolve, so too does the need for spaces that can adapt, transform, and meet the ever-changing demands of the modern workplace. The role of office furniture in ensuring optimal space utilisation and flexibility cannot be understated.

Adaptable Office Layouts Gone are the days when office layouts were static, never changing from year to year. Today’s offices need to be dynamic, capable of shifting from individual workstations to collaborative hubs at a moment’s notice. Modular furniture, which can be easily assembled, disassembled, and reconfigured, offers the perfect solution. Whether it’s the need for a new meeting area or breaking down partitions for an open floor plan, modular pieces provide the flexibility to make it happen without a complete overhaul.

Space Efficiency Especially in urban settings where real estate comes at a premium, maximising the use of available space is crucial. This doesn’t just mean cramming in as many desks as possible. It’s about smart furniture choices—corner desks to utilise often neglected spaces, vertical storage solutions to free up floor space, or under-desk storage units that eliminate the need for additional cabinets.

Multi-functional Furniture One of the hallmarks of modern office furniture is its ability to serve multiple purposes. Think of sit-stand desks that cater to different work postures, ottomans with built-in storage, or desks with integrated tech docks. Such multi-functional pieces not only save space but also enhance convenience, reducing the need for employees to move around constantly.

Room for Growth Businesses are not static entities. They grow, evolve, and sometimes pivot in entirely new directions. Furniture that offers space utilisation and flexibility ensures that the office can accommodate new hires, integrate new technologies, or adapt to new operational methodologies such as Framery Office Pods, without necessitating a complete refurnishing. Framery office pods help you create a happier & more productive working environment.

5. Cost and Affordability In any business endeavor, balancing quality with cost is a perennial challenge. The world of office furniture is no exception. While it’s easy to gravitate towards the cheapest options or be enticed by high-end luxury items, it’s essential to approach furniture acquisition with a clear understanding of cost versus value, ensuring both affordability and long-term benefit.

Understanding True Value in Office Furniture The initial price tag is just a part of the story. A piece of furniture might be inexpensive upfront, but if it wears out quickly, requires frequent maintenance, or leads to workplace inefficiencies, the long-term costs could far outweigh the initial savings. Conversely, a pricier, quality item might provide years of dependable service, ultimately proving to be more economical over its lifespan.

Budgeting Smartly Before diving into purchases, it’s wise to set a clear budget. However, instead of allocating funds uniformly, consider the importance and usage frequency of different office furniture pieces. For instance, investing more in ergonomic office chairs—which directly impact employee health—might be more prudent than splurging on a high-end conference table.

Seeking Deals and Discounts Especially when buying in bulk, there are opportunities for discounts or package deals. Engage with multiple suppliers, explore seasonal sales, or consider bundled offers. Speak to All Office today to get the best deals in office furniture!

Considering Financing Options Some furniture suppliers offer financing options, allowing businesses to spread out the cost over several months or years. At All Office, you can pay over 3 EQUAL zero-interest instalments of R1,429.34 with PayJustNow. The affordability of office furniture isn’t just about the initial outlay—it’s a nuanced consideration of long-term costs, value derived, and the broader impact on workplace efficiency and morale. By approaching purchases with a discerning eye and a comprehensive understanding of costs, businesses can ensure they’re making decisions that are both financially sound and conducive to a thriving workplace.",considering new office space
657,5 Features Every Small Office Needs to Maximise Space,https://daleoffice.co.uk/5-features-every-small-office-needs-to-maximise-space/,,"If upgrading your office isn’t an option, then there are plenty of ways you can maximise the space you have without the hassles of relocating.

A mezzanine floor

Installing a mezzanine floor as part of an office redesign instantly increases valuable floor area where space is a constraint.

Mezzanine floors are typically constructed independent of the main building structure. Locating the support columns in the corners of the room may free up space underneath the mezzanine floor. However, there are many ways to build a mezzanine floor.

Location and quantity of access staircases is determined by travel distances to protected escape routes. Good advice and compliant design are imperative.

Mezzanines can be used to create dedicated areas, such as for relaxation or dining, away from the main work areas.

A mezzanine floor with a stylish staircase can add an attractive design feature to your office too, as well as creating vital extra space.

Case study

Cosmetics company Badgequo were looking for an office design solution which would support the company’s future growth in their current 10,500sqft office. Fitting a mezzanine floor was a key way to maximise the existing space. The mezzanine floor added 145m2 (1560sq ft) to the overall office space. This area is now home to a variety of collaboration spaces including a meeting booth, a number of private meeting rooms and a new kitchen and dining area ‘Nosh and Natter’, to allow staff to enjoy lunchbreaks and downtime away from the main office area.

The mezzanine floor under construction:





Effective storage

Ridding an office of clutter is an obvious way to free up more space. One survey revealed that a cluttered workspace was the number one turn off for people visiting an office, so tidiness is crucial to making a positive first impression.

Include personal storage space, such as lockers, as part of a redesign to instantly reduce clutter by safely storing away employee’s personal items. Lockers increase security and free up desk space

Coat hooks may seem like an innocuous item but they keep chairs free from coats and scarves and can even be used to reflect your company’s brand.

Ensure documents are regularly cleared away by using a weekly confidential waste collection service.

Replace space-hogging flip charts with whiteboards. Better still, install glass boards in branded colours or writable walls to allow easy collaboration and ideas sharing.

Post-It notes, note pads, diaries and desk top calendars create clutter, so swap these for their digital equivalent such as online project management software like Trello.

Install cupboards along corridor walls to increase storage in areas with a lot of ‘dead space’.

Case studies

Many companies need to display products, awards, certificates and other items that enhance their brand. There are clever ways to combine branding, storage and displays in smaller offices:

As part of the Badgequo office redesign, bespoke storage solutions were specified to be used as part of the company’s showroom. The storage units not only display the company’s products but they form movable partitions that create a flexible space for meetings and ideas sessions.

Wall space can also be used for product display and branding purposes. The wall above the reception at outdoor product specialists Go Outdoors features a large display of the company’s actual products. This is a unique way to create a sense of fun, whist simultaneously displaying showcasing what the company specialises in.







Lighting that creates a sense of space

Lighting has a huge impact on how people feel and behave at work, so any office redesign should consider upgrading the current lighting. This is especially important with smaller offices, as a clever use of lighting can actually make the space seem bigger, as well as making it more practical.

Increase the amount of natural light as a priority as natural light can boost productivity and sales

If you do require the extra lighting provided by table and floor lamps, then consider swapping these for wall lights.

Switch to LEDs – these environmentally friendly fittings produce a better quality of light than traditional fluorescent tubes and are far more cost-effective in the long term.

Highlight designated areas within an open plan space by using lighting features to create focal points.

Case study

XL Joinery used lighting to ‘zone’ different areas within the largely open plan office space. This included pendant lighting over collaboration areas and the reception, and ceiling spotlights and panels for more traditional spaces, such as meeting rooms and corridors. To increase natural light, traditional cellular offices were demolished and replaced with open space where direct natural light could be harnessed. Effective use of glass and glass panelling throughout the office increased the distribution of natural light.





Flexibility

Introducing flexibility to a smaller office space can drastically increase the space available.

Allow people to work from home and offer flexitime to free up space by creating opportunities for desk-shares, hot-desking and use of meeting rooms and collaborative spaces for everyday work.

Focus on which areas require the most space. Research shows that employees rate relaxation and breakout spaces as the most important feature in an office to boost productivity, so this could be a consideration if your current layout doesn’t have these.

as the most important feature in an office to boost productivity, so this could be a consideration if your current layout doesn’t have these. Dining areas could double up as collaborative meeting spaces, or they could be given their own dedicated area, as in the case of Badgequo’s mezzanine floor

There might not be space for separate private offices in a small office, but booths and acoustic seating can help to increase privacy and minimise noise distraction.

Case study

The pressures of having to reduce floor space from four to two floors meant law firm Gordons LLP had to completely rethink how they used their office space. To make the limited space work, the whole office was redesigned as open plan, making it the first major law firm in the country with an open plan design. Creating an open plan area meant freeing up the space previously taken by private offices, whilst installing private booths and increasing the space used for breakout areas and meeting spaces.





Example floor plan taking advantage of adaptable furniture to maximise space:

Adaptable furniture

When space is at a premium, furniture can be used in clever ways to make the most of the floor space available.

Modular furniture can make spaces such as collaborative areas more flexible as it can easily be moved around to suit different requirements. Some modular furniture features handy extras such as integrated power modules in seating and screens in tables to free up further space and keep cables cleverly out of sight.

Lighter coloured furniture can create the sense of more space, so opt for white tables and desks for the greatest space-creating effect.

Stackable or folding furniture means excess chairs and tables can be used as and when needed for meetings or as desk space for temporary employees.

Standing tables can fit more people around them compared to traditional tables and can also encourage people to move more. Research suggests that standing can reduce meeting times by 25%,

Movable partitions can be fitted to make spaces more adaptable to a company’s requirements, by opening up or closing off spaces as and when needed.

Case study

The offices of digital media agency Zoo Digital feature white desks, folding partitions and stackable furniture to help the company make the most of the space available.

247,5 Reasons to Consider a Flex Space for Your Business,https://speedcres.com/blog/reasons-consider-flex-space-your-business/,,"If you’ve been hanging around real estate circles these past few years, you’ve probably come across the term Flex Space. But what does it mean, and how can it work for your business?

Well, people are no longer shying away from embracing new ways of organizing corporate spaces. They want solutions that are more efficient, cheaper, and that offer the flexibility necessary to survive in the 21st-century business world.

For years now, businesses would rent real estate spaces that are fixed for particular purposes on long term leases of about ten years. For example, a company would separately lease a warehouse and its office spaces on long term leases. This layout has been the norm for several years. However, it won’t be long before such a business runs into some challenges with this layout. These may include:

Wasted warehouse space when demand expands and goods fly off the shelves

Wasted office space when the staff become redundant

The need to upgrade for more space when demand falls

Lack of flexibility when the contract no longer works in favor of the business

What is Flex Space?

A Flex Space is a form of commercial real estate with a warehouse, office, and retail space. It is usually a sizable warehouse-style building with a built-to–spec office space and a shorter lease than a traditional office.

A Flex Space setup is becoming more attractive to investors who find short term leases more convenient than long term leases. The ability of a Flex Space to easily shift from one purpose to another also endears it to real estate clients.

What Sets Flex Space Apart From Other Real Estate Options?

Over the past few years, commercial real estate has generally fallen into two broad categories: traditional office spaces and flexible office spaces. But what separates flexible office spaces from its contemporary counterpart? These are but a few differences that make Flex Space unique and worth consideration:

1. Length of the Agreement Terms

Traditional office spaces were leased in terms of about 7-10 years, depending on the business operations. Flex Spaces, on the other hand, are leased from about seven months to three years. All of this depends on how long your commercial lease should be. Real estate experts go even further and classify all real-estate options that are leasable for less than three years as part of flexible real estate. This is regardless of whether they are traditional office spaces or flex spaces.

2. Co-working and Shared Spaces

One characteristic common with traditional office spaces is that they are leased by one company. It is uncommon to find a traditional office space or warehouse shared by two or more companies. Not with Flex Spaces. Most Flex Spaces are shared and collectively leased by multiple companies or businesses. Flex Spaces have become a staple for any business that uses the internet or co-working for its day-to-day operations.

3. The Ability to Share Amenities

The fact that Flex Spaces have shared spaces has led to shared amenities. Depending on the type of Flex Space you choose, there will be a wide range of amenities available to all tenants. These amenities may include free Wi-Fi, coffee, and lounges. The ability to share amenities does not exist in traditional office spaces.

4. Lower Startup Capital

Before a business sets up a traditional office space, there is a lot of investment required just to get the office space running. These expenses include wiring, design, furniture, office devices, and many other things necessary for running an office. Flex Spaces, on the other hand, only require an initial payment; the Flex Space offers all the design, furniture, and office devices.

5. Multi-Functional Flex Space

Unlike traditional office spaces, Flex Spaces have been designed in such a way that they can perform multiple functions. A Flex Space can serve as an office, a retail center, a research center, or a warehouse with little to no modification.

Why You Should Consider Using Flex Space

Considering a Flex Space as an option will come with various benefits for your business. Most of these arise from its flexibility as compared to traditional office spaces. Some reasons that should have you thinking about Flex Spaces are:

1. Scalability

Embracing Flexible Spaces as a real estate option offers your business the ability to grow or contract its operation depending on the circumstances. If your company expands and requires a few more feet of office space, that is a phone call away. On the other hand, if you wind down operations in one area and require a smaller space, your Flex space has you sorted.

2. Little To No Initial Costs

The initial costs of setting up a new corporate space can be massive. Funding the furniture, the design, and amenities – added to the monthly maintenance costs, can take a toll on a business. With Flex Spaces, your firm does not have to worry about initial costs, as there are little to none. You only have to worry about rent depending on what dictates commercial rent prices in your area.

3. A Sense of Community

Compared to working from home or remote working, the shared spaces in Flex Spaces create a sense of community and teamwork. One obvious downside of remote working is that it detaches workers from their teams and firms. Flex Spaces, however, create a sense of belonging and motivation between working employees.

4. Improved Networking

Flex Spaces where various companies or workers co-exist create environments that encourage the sharing of ideas. Like-minded entrepreneurs can meet and brainstorm new ideas as other employees make friends and socialize.

5. Contract Flexibility

The brief nature of Flex Space contracts gives your business wriggle room whenever things don’t go your way. The real estate market is volatile; nobody knows how coronavirus will affect the real estate market. A ten-year contract can mean that you are stuck with that real estate agent for a long time. A three-year contract or a twelve-month contract is, however, less binding. Whenever you feel like the location is not working for your business, you can always opt-out.

5. Space Flexibility

The ability of Flexible Spaces to shapeshift into different spaces is a crucial benefit to many businesses. The fact that Flexible Spaces can serve other purposes with minimal adjustments makes them a Godsend to several firms.

400,5 Things You Need to Do Before You Open Your New ...,https://www.mikegingerich.com/blog/things-you-need-to-do-before-you-open-your-new-office-space/,,"Is your business preparing to move to a new location? If so, congratulations! And be sure to do these five things before you open your new office space.

Moving to a new office space can exciting. After all, this your chance for a fresh start in new surroundings. It can also be stressful because there will be a million details to keep track of. Fortunately, you've come to the right place for help.

This article takes a look at tips to remember when moving to a new business space. Keep reading to get the inside scoop on how to make the most of your relocation process while minimizing stress.

1. Location is King

It's no secret that location is everything. This is true for real estate in general, but it's especially important when it comes to business space. After all, you need to choose a location where customers and clients can easily find you, where you can organically attract new clients, and and that makes the daily commute as stress-free as possible for your employees. Also, a more central office will be in close proximity of good commercial cleaners like Think FM London, and other maintenance services you need for a functional workspace. If you can’t find the perfect office space for your company, then you may want to consider purchasing a plot of land and working from the ground up. As a business owner, this provides you with a greater degree of flexibility - as you can curate a space that is specifically tailored for your company, as opposed to a more generic space that comes with hired properties. However, commercial construction work can take a lot of time and effort - meaning that you must consult with experts every step of the way. Not only will this help you ensure that the work is completed to a high standard, but it also means that you can rest easy knowing you have stuck to the law, following government advice at each stage of the development.

For example, the first thing you may think about when it comes to construction is health and safety. While this is definitely something you should pay great attention to - there are other government mandates too. For example, if you are completing conversion work or removing trees, you also need to ensure that you are not disturbing any animal life, such as bats, as they are considered a protected species. This means you will need to work with a bat surveyor ahead of time, who can provide you with the best guidance about how you need to work moving forward. You can read more about the UK's leading bat surveyors at arbtech.co.uk.

It's also important to try to pick a geographical location near airports and other forms of transportation so that shipping services can easily reach you.

2. Plan for Growth

You also need to choose a space that will allow you to grow. In other words, never pick a location-based only on your current needs.

As your business expands, you'll need an office space that's big enough to expand with you. Otherwise, you might find yourself needing to move every year or two, which can ultimately be expensive and inconvenient.

You might be hesitant to buy or lease more space than you need at the moment, but it will likely pay off and cost less in the long run.

3. Re-Think Your Floor Plan

Take a look at how your employees work. What works best and what doesn't?

Open floor plans have become increasingly popular in recent years. They provide flexibility, while also allowing employees to interact in a more organic fashion. After all, individual offices with doors can make employees feel cut off from each other.

Keep in mind that every workplace is different, thus each has differing needs. But the floor plan you choose can dramatically impact productivity and the overall mental health and well-being of your employees.

4. Invest in the Right Office Furniture

Good ergonomic office furniture can make a world of difference, especially when your employees spend most of their day seated at a computer.

Specific office furniture such as standing desks can reduce lower back pain, resulting in a more pleasant work experience. At the same time, whiteboards are important for meeting rooms as they assist in the discussions and collaboration that occurs in such rooms.

Be sure to check out more information on adjustable computer monitors.

5. Have Connections Up and Running Prior to the Move

It's also important to have all utilities connected before moving into your new space. This includes electric, water, power, and internet service. Otherwise, you might find yourself losing a day or more of productivity because of the downtime while you wait for the connections to be hooked up. This isn't just a huge inconvenience, it can be a major headache that will cost you money.

218,5 Things to Consider Before Switching to a Virtual Office ...,https://futuramo.com/blog/5-things-to-consider-before-switching-to-a-virtual-office-space/,,"Virtual office spaces are all the rage right now, thanks to the rise of remote work and digital nomads. Virtual rental offices are also known as coworking spaces, collaborative workspaces, or hybrid workspaces. Such locations are physical locations that offer the opportunity for businesses to rent virtual office services.

Such services might include a receptionist, meeting rooms, mail handling, audio/video conferencing, and desk space – all from a single provider rather than renting these resources individually or hiring individual assistants. A virtual office rental is a great way for companies to save money, increase productivity, and attract top talent. However, with so many coworking spaces popping up everywhere, it can be hard to know which one is right for you.

If you’re on the fence about switching to having one, read on. In this article, we will discuss five things you should consider before switching to a virtual office space, as well as give advice on how to get started setting up your own if that sounds like something you’d be interested in exploring further.

Know What You Want From Your Virtual Office Space

Before you even start looking for a virtual office space, you should know exactly what you want from such a space. It should do more than just give you a space to work from – it should also provide you with the resources and support staff that remote workers need to be successful.

It should allow you to feel like you’re part of a team, even though you’re not working in the same physical building as your colleagues. It should allow you to focus on the work that you need to be doing while giving you the support you need to do it well. This means that you should have a private, quiet place to work. You should also have all of your technology set up and ready to go when you start your day, so you don’t have to worry about taking time out of your day to set up a new computer or finding a place to plug in your printer.

You should also have access to a printer, fax machine, and scanner—or at the very least, be able to get ahold of someone who can help you with these tasks. With that being said, you should look for a company that offers the inclusions you have in mind to make sure you get the best deal out of it. You may want to look for a coworking franchise company because they are usually established in their field and typically give you the best deals with all these inclusions.

Ask the Right Questions

When you’re looking into prospective coworking offices, make sure to ask the right questions. First, ask about their clientele. Who are the typical companies who use their services? Why did they choose this coworking office? What do they like about it? What do they not like about it? What do they wish they could change about it?

Next, ask about their space. Where are the offices located? What are the specifics of the space? Are there different options for the type of space you want (desk, hot desk, conference room)? How is the space equipped? How many people use the space? How many people share a desk? How many people have their own desk?

Ask as well about the services they offer. What other services do they provide in addition to co-working? Do they have any special packages that are designed for your type of business? How many people are available to assist you with your day-to-day tasks? What are their hours? What are their closing times?

Find Out Exactly What’s Included

You should also find out exactly what’s included on that coworking space that you’re considering. This means you need to know what the rates are going to be. How much are you going to be paying? Are there any additional costs? How often will you be expected to pay? Are there any contracts involved? Are there cancellation policies?

You also need to know what you get for your money. How many people will be sharing the space with you? What type of equipment will you have access to? What type of services are included? Are there any special features available? Are there additional services that you can pay for?

Determine How Much Employees Will Benefit from Working There

You might be wondering just how much employees will benefit from working in a coworking/vitual office space, and there are many factors at play. For example, you may have employees working in the same office building, but they never speak with one another. And you might have employees working from home, but they never speak with one another. However, there are benefits to working in a virtual office space, benefits that might not exist in either of the above situations.

Working there with other employees, whether they are in-house employees or remote workers, provides an opportunity for human interaction. This might sound silly if you work alone, but don’t underestimate the importance of human connection, especially when it comes to productivity and retention. Having that set up also offers the opportunity to exchange ideas and thoughts with other employees and build relationships with people who might not otherwise be in your life.

Make Sure It’s Right for You and Your Company

Before you sign on the dotted line, make sure you and your company are the right fit for this new office set up. This is important in terms of your needs and your company culture. For example, virtual offices usually have a 24/7 operating schedule. This means the receptionist is always on call, and the lights are always on. This might not work for you if you have employees who prefer to work at certain times or if you have employees who work best in silence.

Additionally, you need to make sure the provider has the correct equipment for your team. For example, if your team relies heavily on smartphones for communication, make sure you have reliable cell phone service in the space. If you need specific equipment that is not typically provided by the company, make sure the provider has the capacity to accommodate your unique needs.

Make sure the provider is a good fit for your company culture, too. For example, will your employees feel comfortable and right at home in the space? Will they be able to use the equipment they need to do their jobs? Will they feel welcome in the space?

Final Thoughts

It’s important to understand all the benefits of a virtual office space before you make a decision about switching to such a space. They are cheaper than renting an office, but they are not for everyone. Make sure you have all your options open and are making an informed decision before switching to a virtual office. Just don’t rush the decision, and make sure you know what you’re getting into.",considering new office space
7,5 Tips on How to Survive In an Open Space Office and Get ...,https://naturaily.com/blog/5-tips-survive-open-space-office-work,,"What is an open space?

There is no doubt that office design plays an important role in how a company operates daily. The layout of a workspace holds several vital implications for any business, including cost, communication, privacy and social culture.

Open-plan offices have been around since 1906 when architect Frank Lloyd Wright designed the Larkin Administration Building in New York. Besides other innovations like air conditioning and built-in desk furniture, this workspace was also open-plan, with few walls.

Advocates of open-plan offices say that they provide more opportunities for people to work well, because they place fewer physical barriers between colleagues. This, they argue, encourages greater communication and teamwork. These designs fit modern business needs, too. They allow organizations to easily accommodate extra people, and they are popular with CEOs who want to engineer ""collisions"" between their people. These collisions are chance or spontaneous meetings between co-workers who wouldn't normally connect with one another, and are seen as a way to promote collaboration and inspire innovation.

What are the obstacles

It’s arguably true that doing away with physical barriers in the workplace can encourage greater collaboration and camaraderie among employees, but we’ve quickly reached the point of diminishing returns. With more collaboration comes more talking. With more talking comes more distractions, and with more distractions come drops in productivity. You’ll hear multiple conversations occurring around you throughout the day, both in person and on the phone. You may even start to notice a co-worker’s annoying little habits, which can draw your attention away from your work.

If these problems describe your situation, here are 5 tips that can help you regain your sanity — and your productivity:

1. Office etiquette

Sharing space will inevitably create tensions, as individual preferences, needs and work styles butt up against each other.

Involve staff in developing agreements about how to make the space work for everyone. This could be in the form of a facilitated workshop that addresses issues such as managing noise, interruptions, desk cleanliness and how to signal availability for interaction – wearing headphones is a common “I’m not available” signal.

2. Quiet spaces

Sometimes, no matter how hard you try to concentrate, the office is simply too distracting. And if you're working on a tight deadline or an important project that you have to get just right, that adds to the pressure. In fact, even if your office is relatively quiet and sedate on a day when you're grappling with said deadline or project, you might suddenly find even minor noises or movements highly distracting.

Some open plan offices do incorporate private offices (or quiet rooms) that people can use, so escaping there could be an alternative. If not - try booking a conference room for an hour or two. Coworkers will assume that a scheduled meeting room demands privacy, and you will be able to work without being chatted up, touched, or otherwise harassed for the duration. It’s like having a proper office for a while, only it’s an office where nobody will knock on the door, and you can turn off your phone.

3. Fresh air and exercise

Fresh air has long been touted as something able to cure whatever ails you. And it's true. If you make it a point to leave the office and step outside once every day, that can go a long way toward defusing any stress that's been building from your open office setting. So head out during your break for a walk around the block. Go out to lunch at your favorite restaurant, or eat your sack lunch on a park bench. Don't let inclement weather stop you; make sure you have boots, warm clothing, an umbrella — whatever you need to fight the elements in your area.

Remember to breathe deeply when you're outside, too, to get as much air into your lungs as possible. (Deep-breathing is also a stress-reliever.) Exercise helps boost your mood, too. If you're able, take a brisk walk or even run during your outdoor break, assuming your workplace has shower facilities. If none of this is possible, walk to another part of the building once a day. Simply leaving your surroundings for a while can provide stress relief and a sense of perspective.

4. Technology

Sometimes all it takes is a little technology to help you withstand the challenges of an open office. Can't stand your colleagues' constant chatter? Try wearing noise-cancelling headphones while you work. You can also look for a website that has a variety of white noise and environmental sounds to use for background. If you prefer music at work, a study showed that, for best results, listen to classical music if you're dealing with numbers; pop music for data entry or deadlines and dance music when proofreading or problem-solving.

5. The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions.

The process is simple:

For every project throughout the day, you budget your time into short increments and take breaks periodically. You work for 25 minutes, then take break for five minutes. Each 25-minute work period is called a “pomodoro”, named after the Italian word for tomato. After four “pomodoros” have passed, (100 minutes of work time with 15 minutes of break time) you then take a 15-20 minute break.

If you have a large and varied to-do list, using the Pomodoro Technique can help you crank through projects faster by forcing you to adhere to strict timing. Watching the timer wind down can spur you to wrap up your current task more quickly, and spreading a task over two or three pomodoros can keep you from getting frustrated. The constant timing of your activities makes you more accountable for your tasks and minimizes the time you spend procrastinating.

Conclusion

If you find yourself having to work in an open office space for the first time, don’t be afraid. Talk to your colleagues to see how they’ve adjusted. Everyone has a different approach that may be beneficial to finding your groove. Be considerate of those around you and you will do just fine.",plans to open new office
707,5 steps of the strategic planning process,https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/5-steps-of-the-strategic-planning-process,,"Every business should have a strategic planâbut the number of businesses that try to operate without a defined plan (or at least a clearly communicated one)Â might surprise you. Research from OnStrategy shows that 86% of executive teams spend less than one hour per month discussing strategy, and 95% of a typical workforce doesnât understand its organizationâs strategy. Because so many businesses lack in these regards, you can get ahead of the game by using strategic planning. In this article, we will explain what the strategic planning process looks like and the steps involved.

Strategic planning process (click on image to modify online)

What is the strategic planning process? In the simplest terms, the strategic planning process is the method that organizations use to develop plans to achieve overall, long-term goals. This process differs from the project planningÂ process, which is used to scope and assign tasks for individual projects, or strategy mapping, which helps you determine your mission, vision, and goals. The strategic planning process is broadâit helps you create a roadmap for which strategic objectives you should put effort into achieving and which initiatives would be less helpful to the business.Â Strategic planning process steps Before you begin the strategic planning process, it is important to review some steps to set you and your organization up for success. 1. Determine your strategic position This preparation phase sets the foundation for all work going forward. You need to know where you are to determine where you need to go and how you will get there. Involve the right stakeholders from the start, considering both internal and external sources. Identify key strategic issues by talking with executives at your company, pulling in customer insights, and collecting industry and market data. This will give you a clear picture of your position in the market and customer insight. It can also be helpful to reviewâor create if you donât have them alreadyâyour companyâs mission and vision statements to give yourself and your team a clear image of what success looks like for your business. In addition, review your companyâs core values to remind yourself about how your company plans to achieve these objectives. To get started, use industry and market data, including customer insights and current/future demands, to identify the issues that need to be addressed. Document your organization's internal strengths and weaknesses, along with external opportunities (ways your organization can grow in order to fill needs that the market does not currently fill) and threats (your competition).Â As a framework for your initial analysis, use a SWOT diagram.Â With input from executives, customers, and external market data, you can quickly categorize your findings as Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) to clarify your current position.

SWOT Analysis Example (Click on image to modify online)

An alternative to a SWOT is PEST analysis. Standing for Political, Economic, Socio-cultural, and Technological, PEST is a strategic tool used to clarify threats and opportunities for your business.Â

PEST analysis (click on image to modify online)

As you synthesize this information, your unique strategic position in the market will become clear, and you can start solidifying a few key strategic objectives. Often, these objectives are set with a three- to five-year horizon in mind.

Use PEST analysis for additional help with strategic planning. Learn how

2. Prioritize your objectives Once you have identified your current position in the market, it is time to determine objectives that will help you achieve your goals. Your objectives should align with your company mission and vision. Prioritize your objectivesÂ by asking important questions such as: Which of these initiatives will have the greatest impact on achieving our company mission/vision and improving our position in the market?

What types of impact are most important (e.g. customer acquisition vs. revenue)?

How will the competition react?

Which initiatives are most urgent?

What will we need to do to accomplish our goals?

How will we measure our progress and determine whether we achieved our goals? Objectives should be distinct and measurable to help you reach your long-term strategic goals and initiatives outlined in step one. Potential objectives can be updating website content, improving email open rates, and generating new leads in the pipeline. 3. Develop a plan Now it's time to create a strategic plan to reach your goals successfully. This step requires determining the tactics necessary to attain your objectives and designating a timeline and clearly communicating responsibilities.Â Strategy mapping is an effective tool to visualize your entire plan. Working from the top-down, strategy maps make it simple to view business processes and identify gaps for improvement.

Strategy map example (click on image to modify online)

Truly strategic choices usually involve a trade-off in opportunity cost. For example, your company may decide not to put as much funding behind customer support, so that it can put more funding into creating an intuitive user experience. Be prepared to use your values, mission statement, and established priorities to say ânoâ to initiatives that wonât enhance your long-term strategic position. Â 4. Execute and manage the plan Once you have the plan, youâre ready to implement it. First, communicate the plan to the organization by sharing relevant documentation. Then, the actual work begins. Turn your broader strategy into a concrete plan by mapping your processes. Use key performance indicator (KPI) dashboards to communicate team responsibilities clearly. This granular approach illustrates the completion process and ownership for each step of the way.Â Set up regular reviews with individual contributors and their managers and determine check-in points to ensure youâre on track. 5. Review and revise the plan The final stage of the planâto review and reviseâgives you an opportunity to reevaluate your priorities and course-correct based on past successes or failures. On a quarterly basis, determine which KPIs your team has met and how you can continue to meet them, adapting your plan as necessary. On an annual basis, itâs important to reevaluate your priorities and strategic position to ensure that you stay on track for success in the long run. Track your progress using balanced scorecards to comprehensively understand of your business's performance and execute strategic goals.Â

Balanced scorecard (click on image to modify online)

Over time you may find that your mission and vision need to changeÂ â an annual evaluation is a good time to consider those changes, prepare a new plan, and implement again.Â

Achieve your goals and monitor your progress with balanced scorecards. Learn how

Master the strategic planning process steps As you continue to implement the strategic planning process, repeating each step regularly, you will start to make measurable progress toward achieving your companyâs vision. Instead of constantly putting out fires, reacting to the competition, or focusing on the latest hot-button initiative, youâll be able to maintain a long-term perspective and make decisions that will keep you on the path to success for years to come.

708,5 trends shaping the future of corporate strategy,https://www.graphite.com/blog/5-trends-shaping-the-future-of-corporate-strategy,,"Having foresight is key to developing a winning corporate strategy. But between sifting through a sea of data, navigating unpredictable events like the pandemic, and keeping up with the pace of technological innovation, knowing what to keep an eye out for can be challenging.Â

According to Gartner, the average corporate strategist spends 26% of their teamâs time and around $200,000 of the annual budget investigating emerging trends. With the increased spending on corporate strategy expertise (up 51% YoY on Graphite), we wanted to know the trends shaping the future of this core functional skill.Â

â

To get to the bottom of this question, we engaged our network of experts on the ground floor in developing and executing corporate strategies for their clients on Graphite. Here are the five trends we unearthed.Â

1. Growth Strategy Will Take on a Whole New Meaning

For years, the role of corporate strategy was centered on where to play and how to win. But as the pace of disruption accelerates, it's no longer enough to just focus on those areas. To succeed in todayâs environment, corporate strategists must focus on speed and capabilities.Â

Yet focusing on speed and capabilities must also be done with caution. Rather than focusing on growth at all costs, the focus will be on making smarter, harder investment decisions that will lead to sustainable growth and a risk-averse portfolio.Â

A key component to accomplishing this will be finding new ways to differentiate the business from the competition. This will be done in several ways, either by M&A or building those capabilities within the business. Data and analytics, digital customer engagement, and the ability to create digital business models will factor greatly into strategic plans.Â

And while M&A growth will be more conservative when compared to 2021, it will still serve as a viable growth strategy as it relates to building out new business capabilities. In this regard, the use of data and technology as part of the transaction process and the ability to execute and move quickly will be vital for any M&A-led growth strategy.Â

2. Data and Market Research Will Play a Pivotal Role

Given the uncertainty of new and upcoming coronavirus variants, the economy, and geopolitical tensions, businesses are increasingly relying on data and market research to gain a competitive advantage.Â

Fueling this demand for information is the need to quickly synthesize patterns and trends to enable faster decision-making across the entire organization. From an operational perspective, data is essential in driving supply chain efficiencies. Visibility into inventory, distribution, and production goes a long way in protecting a company's bottom line.Â

Likewise, the use of consumer data to inform go-to-market strategies enables companies to better position themselves when entering a new market or launching a new product or service. As digitization and the need to gain new capabilities increase, more emphasis will be placed on market research and data to ensure these initiatives succeed.Â

3. Building a Resilient Workforce amid Economic Uncertainty

Growing a team during uncertain economic times remains the main concern for CEOs this year. Leaders face a trifecta of challenges: a slowing economy, decreased profitability, and a tight labor market. Building a team thatâs agile and resilient can future-proof the business. But where to start?Â

One way hiring managers are widening their talent pool is by leveraging a skill-based hiring model. By hiring for the right skill, companies can build a hyper-focused and more flexible workforce.

Another approach companies are exploring is on-demand talent acquisition platforms. This hiring model enables companies to build agile and flexible teams on demandâ helping them pivot and innovate at a much faster pace than with traditional talent acquisition models.Â

Beyond filling an immediate need, businesses can upskill their workforce with the help of independent talent. Likewise, they can layer this hiring model on top of their existing talent strategy to build an agile operating model where talent can be deployed quickly to the highest priority work â ensuring strategic work gets done on time.Â Â Â

4. Developing More Flexible, Agile, and Adaptable Supply Chains

Supply chain issues will remain a hot-button area for businesses across industries for the foreseeable future. Weâve touched on this throughout this blog, as trends, like most things, are interconnected and influence and impact one another.Â

As businesses strive to optimize supply chain operations to satisfy consumer demand, they are using all the tools at their disposal. That means investing in data to facilitate the acquisition and implementation of automation, AI, and machine learning technologies to conduct M&As in adjacent sectors to remove barriers to resources.Â

To truly move beyond a reactive state, leaders will need to start focusing on producing the next disruption rather than waiting for it. As a result, companies will be relying more heavily on data and market research to compete effectively, not just with adjacent businesses, but with uncontrollable factors such as climate change as well.Â

This is especially true at a time when visibility, tracing, and sustainability are becoming central themes for supply chain leaders. As a result, ESG projects, although not a top priority at the start of the year, will continue to increase in the future.Â

5. Continued Acceleration of DigitizationÂ

Digitization has been an ongoing trend, but the pandemic put it into overdrive. Companies that did not have technology as a priority had to quickly pivot and reevaluate their stance on the tech and tools they use.Â

Today, the implementation of technology has permeated the entire business ecosystem. Companies are increasingly leaning into AI and machine learning to optimize supply chains, increase productivity, improve customer experiences, and enhance cybersecurity.Â

Business leaders show no signs of slowing down either. Global spending on technology is expected to rise by 2.4% this year. Despite an economic slowdown and cost-cutting efforts, companies remain firm in their commitment to digital initiatives by increasing their investments.Â

However, productivity and efficiency aren't the only reasons behind the demand. Businesses are also analyzing how AI and machine learning can be used as a value driver rather than a cost factor.Â

John-David Lovelock, Gartner's research vice president, says that IT spending remains recession-proof. He further states, âwhile inflation is devastating consumer markets, contributing to layoffs at B2C companies, enterprises continue to increase spending on digital business initiatives despite the world economic slowdown.âÂ

Itâs All about Staying Ahead of the Trends and Capturing Future Value Today

Corporate strategists today are dealing with multiple unknowns and must be able to pivot at a moment's notice. Besides continuously developing holistic strategies that maximize the benefits of businesses' investments and initiatives, they're also expected to accomplish more with less.Â Â Â Â

In 2018, the average corporate strategy team consisted of five members. But with the shifts in todayâs labor market, it's likely that the sizes of these teams have either remained or changed, given the increased demand for this core functional skill.Â

One way to navigate the trends shaping corporate strategy's future is to lean on independent experts to add capacity and horsepower to your teams. Adding expertise to your strategies can enhance the effectiveness of your projects while fast-tracking new projects and initiatives.Â

95,5 ways office design will adapt to hybrid working - COEL,https://coel.co.uk/the-future-of-the-office-5-ways-office-design-will-adapt-to-hybrid-working/,,"Cast your mind back a few decades and ‘the office’ was predominantly a functional space, populated by industrious white-collar workers, sitting at carbon copy desks, below glaring fluorescent strip lights.

[We still shudder at the memory of those headache-inducing artificial lights!] Staff would be expected to clock on and off – appraised on the number of hours they notched up at their desk, as opposed to overall performance. And woe betide the employee who had the gall to log off at the strike of five and shamelessly leave the office ‘on time’. Thankfully, this regimented model has been drastically overhauled in recent years, with offices no longer viewed as staff ‘containers’. Instead, agile working spaces which promote social interaction and collaboration, are being created, which has meant a paradigm shift in the way we approach office design. What is the catalyst for this change in our approach to office design?

There is no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw millions of people across Europe switch to home working has permanently altered our expectations of how an office should be designed.

Though WFH was an initial shock to the system, many people quickly noticed the benefits of remote working, from banishing laborious commutes to being able to incorporate wellbeing rituals into their days (a brisk Peloton ride around Central Park or a heart-pumping HIIT session over lunch!).

As a consequence, there’s been an increased demand for ‘hybrid working’, offering employees the flexibility to fulfil the 9 to 5 partly in an office and partly remotely.

Indeed, a recent report by management consulting company McKinsey showed that 76 per cent of European workers said they preferred to have some sort of hybrid working option.

How does this impact the future of ‘the office’ and office design

According to The Economist, in a post-pandemic world, where hybrid working is becoming the norm, the office is no longer simply a bricks and mortar work location, but rather ‘a social destination’.

As such, offices of the future are likely to be planned and designed around human behaviour, with more focus on nurturing the wellbeing and comfort of staff. This could mean incorporating aspects such as:

Collaboration spaces where creativity can be sparked

Relaxation zones for moments of calm, away from the glare of screens

Spaces of positive social interaction such as restaurants and bars

Wellness and wellbeing facilities (morning bootcamp, anyone?)

Areas of informal learning where employees can build social positioning



With the dawn of hybrid working, the role of the office is clearly undergoing a seismic shift. But, what will the new working landscape look like?

Will the bulk of the job be completed at home, with the office dedicated to ‘face time’ (where colleagues can meet and reconnect)? It seems maybe not…

“The office remains central to the ecosystem of work,” say JLL Global Benchmarking Services and JLL Global Research in their recent report, Hybrid Work Decoded. “We know today that hybrid has a durable presence, but it has to be organised around the needs and preferences of employees. Spaces, technologies, support services, acoustics and working patterns all play a part in creating the right working environment,” they conclude.



So, what will be the main features of tomorrow’s office design?

Will banks of cubicles, individual desks and private offices be consigned to a skip, in favour of wide, open space and break-out zones?

Perhaps not entirely, but employers are going to have to think outside the box when briefing office designers to adapt to this new template, with the need for collaboration and employee wellbeing rising to the top of the agenda.

Here’s COEL’s top 5 tips for redesigning the office of the future:

1. The office as a social destination

What will motivate a current employee to make the office pilgrimage or attract new talent to the business?

The office should be designed as an inspiring destination , offering an ‘experience’ which cannot be achieved at home, somewhere for face-to-face exchanges, training and learning opportunities.

, offering an ‘experience’ which cannot be achieved at home, somewhere for face-to-face exchanges, training and learning opportunities. There’s certainly still a desire for office time, with 87 per cent of workers claiming this environment is ‘vital to collaborating and building relationships’ (according to a US PwC survey).

So, how does a business go about designing this sought-after space?

Our friends at Google, creators of ‘the happiest, most productive workplace in the world’ can offer some clarity. Whilst not all employers will be able to emulate Google’s wackiest designs (think office putting greens, vintage subway cars and revolving bookcases), the search engine giant does have some great ideas when it comes to office interior design.

Open plan office design gets a big tick, with Google believing office culture promotes ‘casual collisions’ between employees, leading to positive collaborations. Consequently, each Google workspace is designed to stimulate social interaction and creativity, meaning staff from different departments (who wouldn’t normally network) end up mixing.

gets a big tick, with Google believing office culture promotes ‘casual collisions’ between employees, leading to positive collaborations. Consequently, each Google workspace is designed to stimulate social interaction and creativity, meaning staff from different departments (who wouldn’t normally network) end up mixing. Also, in Google’s New York HQ, no part of the office is more than 150 feet from food, designed to encourage workers to converge in the café, restaurant or lounge to ‘snack more, chat more and most importantly, inspire more’. We bet the coffee is top-notch too!

A project with dynamic investment company, IQ Capital, saw COEL install table tennis and bats within the office environment to encourage staff to have some fun and engage with team mates on a non-work matter in a very corporate environment.



2 A focus on wellbeing at work

The wellbeing of its employees should be a top priority for employers, especially in a post-pandemic world. Happy, healthy employees are known to thrive in a positive, nurturing office environment. Investing in wellbeing leads to increased staff resilience, higher productivity, better employee engagement, and less sickness absence.

Full height windows and skylights are a great office design choice for allowing an abundance of natural light to flow in, creating a calm, welcoming environment. Studies show that workers exposed to high levels of natural light not only sleep better, but report fewer headaches, reduced eye strain and generally feel more buoyant.

And introducing plants to the office environment boosts happiness, as we humans have an innate desire to connect to nature, known as biophilia. Not only are botanicals beautiful, but they help to reduce stress, boost positivity and clean the air. We recommend succulents, including cacti, which thrive in workplaces, as do peace lilies.

Another easy fix for employers is to choose calming and relaxing colours for their office design, which promote feelings of tranquillity and serenity, as opposed to heavily branded spaces.

COEL worked with Bury St Edmunds-based building services contractor I-MEX (M&E) Ltd to create a purpose-built workspace incorporating floor to ceiling glazing, and a structural glazed floor, which flooded the foyer with daylight and adding a dramatic lustre to the entrance.

In another transformative project COEL created a dramatic kitchen in dark blue for Wren Therapeutics, with soft lighting and a biophilic display overhanging the table, plus privacy booths installed around the outside. These features created a calming space that was a soft antidote to the required clinical bright lighting and white features of the laboratories.



3. A Digital-First Design Approach

To support the new hybrid working model, businesses will need a strong digital-first culture to help keep employees productive, engaged and happy. This type of technology supports an increasing need for adaptable spaces in office design, capable of managing shared spaces and even tracking occupancy levels to adapt to usage needs.

Some crucial tools in the digital-first office design bundle could include virtual meeting applications, hybrid scheduling (a phone app so staff can clearly identify office and remote working days), and instant messaging software.

could include virtual meeting applications, hybrid scheduling (a phone app so staff can clearly identify office and remote working days), and instant messaging software. There will be a further evolution of this type of technology to incorporate video conferencing and AI options (which is already happening in some high-tech AI businesses), so that employees in the offices and those working remotely from home can chat and debate as if they were in the same room.

4. Increasingly Flexible Office Design

With the traditional office model consigned to the architectural dustbin, there’s no longer a one size fits all solution to designing work spaces.

The office design of the future should be innovative and offer a multitude of options including relaxation zones, common rooms to host cross-team collaborations, quiet breakout spaces for brainstorming, and private rooms where delicate conversations can take place.

and offer a multitude of options including relaxation zones, common rooms to host cross-team collaborations, quiet breakout spaces for brainstorming, and private rooms where delicate conversations can take place. Welcoming social hubs, such as cafes or bars, should be incorporated into office design, to encourage employees from all departments to come together. This office set-up means staff can choose the area which best suits the type of work they are conducting at a specific moment.

A commission for Cambridge-based Jazz Pharmaceuticals saw COEL create an agile new office, where versatility was key. Acoustic pods and meeting booths were installed for quieter time and meeting spaces; an enticing kitchen with central island was built to encourage socialisation; and a cosy enclave was fitted with plush sofas for peaceful contemplation.



5. Ergonomic Office Furniture Design

Why settle for a traditional swivel chair and table set-up when you can work your muscles and your grey matter at the same time using a treadmill desk? Now that’s the definition of multi-tasking!

Or, perhaps you prefer a standing desk for better back support on days that require hours of screen time? There is no doubt that the options for office furniture are evolving in line with our expectations for flexibility in office design.

Smart furniture is the perfect antidote to the sedentary day-to-day of an office worker and it’s a big hit with the Apple watch and Fitbit-wearing generation, who recognise the importance of moving our bodies more throughout the day.

is the perfect antidote to the sedentary day-to-day of an office worker and it’s a big hit with the Apple watch and Fitbit-wearing generation, who recognise the importance of moving our bodies more throughout the day. Ergonomic office furniture, whether incorporating futuristic innovations or not, is set to drastically change the way we work. Employers are recognising this need for staff to work from different spaces across the office, and the satisfaction this can bring.

COEL specialises in forward-thinking ergonomic furniture for the modern workforce, from stylish supportive office chairs to dynamic desk options.

Enterprising technology company Agile Analog recently asked COEL to fit out a workspace that supported a more collaborative style of working for their rapidly expanding workforce. This included thoughtfully curated furniture in enticing colour palettes such as open plan desks conducive to mind-mapping, softly furnished pouffes for relaxation, and a breakfast bar with high-backed stools for sociable mealtimes.



A final thought on the future of office design

Our head of Sales and Marketing, Barnaby Clark, adds:

With hybrid working practices set to become the status quo, employers face many challenges when considering how to design their offices in line with this new flexible model, from embracing the latest digital technology to reconfiguring existing office space. At the forefront of all these decisions will be the needs of the employees, and examining how these can be aligned with those of the business to ensure both continue to thrive.

One thing’s for sure, if the design of your office space can make adjusting to this new way of working just that little bit easier, then we’re all for harnessing the amazing possibilities of the office of the future (as long as those luminous strip lights aren’t included!).

352,5 workspace trends for the future office,https://www.kinnarps.com/knowledge/five-global-workplace-trends-to-discover/,,"TREND 1: DIVERSE DESIGN

How can we design workplaces to meet the needs of the many?

Looking into the future, design equality and inclusive environments will be a matter of course in all workplaces. We can see three major shifts taking place.

1. For the first time in history, we will have four generations working side by side, meaning that their different ways of thinking and acting must be taken into consideration when designing working environments.

2. The struggle for equality between women and men in our professional lives is entering a new phase. Questioning the existing design status quo from a gender perspective will be a driver for creating a truly inclusive workplace environment.

3. Everyone has a different way of thinking to find solutions and solve problems. A main difference is the one between the introvert and the extrovert personality, and the future workplace should cater to both.

These three main shifts, coupled with the more global workforce, create a true cultural melting pot. Together, they drive the demand for design that caters for all types of physical differences while underlining the need for inclusive design: design that considers the full range of human diversity with respect to ability, language, culture, gender, age and other forms of human difference.",future office expansion plans
250,5-questions-to-ask-before-planning-your-new-office-space,https://www.db-workspace.com/blog/5-questions-to-ask-before-planning-your-new-office-space,,"So you want to upgrade your office space? Whether you are going to expand your current office or completely relocate, there’s one thing you’ll need to do first: you’re going to have to do some planning.





And we might as well go over some ‘obvious’ points first because obvious things are often also straightforward to miss. I know there’s a perfect idiom to illustrate this, but I can’t think of it now.

It may seem obvious, but a little office space planning will really help you get the most reward for your effort. Planning will help you with the measurable efficiency and best use of space and even help you go deep in creating a strong culture.





This will probably seem obvious too, but you’ll want to plan it from the user’s point of view. But, then, when you really think about how your team members will be using the space, you’ll make it both comfortable and conducive to work.





And another obvious point is to plan well in advance. When creating that perfect, form-meets-function office space, the process takes time, and you don’t want to be caught short. So you’ll want to start the planning months before you plan to move in.



Talk to professional office space planners who thoroughly understand your business. The way you run your business is unique; make sure the space planners you use have a thorough understanding of how your business runs. One size does not fit all.



Once the professionals you are using grasp your needs, they will use their experience to design an office space that increases both productivity and user satisfaction.



In the meantime, here are 5 questions to answer for yourself. Then, make sure you share the answers with your office space planner.





What do you need?

The first question to ask yourself is what you actually need. What is your current reality? How do you use your current office space? Will you be using your new office space the same way?



Are you heading towards using a flexible, open floor plan? Or do your employees need their own designated space? If you often have customers visiting, you’ll have different office space needs than if your clients interact primarily by phone or email.



The point is, your office space should make it easier for you to do business. You want it to work for you; you want it to earn its keep. You don’t want it cramped; that will only hinder your team’s productivity, but at the same time, there’s no point paying for and maintaining a lavish conference room or customer lounge that doesn’t get used.





Are you growing?

You’re not planning to stay precisely the same size as you are today. So whether you have a team of 5, 50, or 500, your office space planning needs to consider next year. In fact, you really want to lean out 3 to 5 years and imagine where you’ll be in terms of staff.



But don’t only consider growth by the total potential number of people. Instead, break it down a bit more, maybe by department, and consider if you’ll have enough space for each department as it grows.

By weighing this over as part of your office space planning, you’ll be able to minimize the risk that you could grow, hire… and then be left wondering where to put your new talent.



Of course, the other risk is that you could have more space than you need and have to carry its cost. But there are creative ways to minimize that risk too, and as long as you are careful that your lease allows it, you may be able to sublease as much or as little as you want. One forward-planning company I know intentionally built in substantially more office space than they need and rents out even as little as a single desk for a single day. This way, they have plenty of space for years to come but are not carrying more cost than necessary.



This brings us to the next question!





Open spaces, cubicles, or hybrid?

It would be easy to jump on the open-space bandwagon and insist that all new office plans be designed for collaboration.



Or you could pass it off as a fad and decide to stick with traditional cubicles.



But in reality, each design serves a different purpose. Therefore, your professional office design planner should thoroughly understand how your business works and how the individual teams within your business work and interact before making recommendations.



Many businesses are finding a hybrid approach that brings together the best of both worlds: quiet rooms for private, focused tasks and open, collaborative zones for team interaction and collaboration.





Do you have remote offices?

If you have staff working at remote locations, whether at their home 20 minutes away or another office on the other side of the world, you don’t need to think about them when you’re planning your very local office upgrade, right?



Wrong. That was totally a trick question.



You see, often remote staff isn’t actually remote 100% of the time. Employees that work from home 2 days a week still need space the rest of the time. Employees from another office may come en masse for quarterly meetings. And there are also times when remote employees may come for training, team building, or kicking off a new project.



Any of those times will need extra space to be available, but it would be overkill to plan on as much space per person for occasional use as you do for full-time users.



This is another time when a hybrid design of quiet rooms and open collaboration zones can really make a difference. With flexible space and furniture, your office will be comfortable for all the employees there at any point.





What else makes you unique?

An office space planner will help you identify and work with nearly unlimited variations of special considerations.





For example:

Where will you hold video conferences with your remote workers?

Do your lunchroom and break rooms meet your employees’ needs beyond basic survival?

Will it be easy for users – both employees and visiting clients – to charge their electronics? Do you have charging stations available?

677,6 Key Factors to Successful Strategic Planning,https://www.bluebeyondconsulting.com/blog/6-key-factors-successful-strategic-planning/,,"Many of our clients come to Blue Beyond seeking a partner for successful planning. Planning for a culture reboot. Planning to overhaul their recruitment and retention efforts. Planning to implement a new communication strategy. Planning to help them navigate a crisis. Planning a leadership offsite. But, one of our biggest requests centers around strategic planning and aligning leaders, managers, and employees to bring the strategy to life.

Many organizations have a systematic process for strategic planning but look back a year later and wonder, “What happened?” According to research outlined in the Harvard Business Review, 85% of executive leadership teams spend less than one hour per month discussing strategy, and 50% spend no time at all.

What Is Effective Strategic Planning?

It turns out that a lot of people aren’t entirely clear what a strategy or strategic plan is — or how to make it impactful. They confuse it with organizational goals, objectives, and motivational taglines and oftentimes end up creating an operational plan (the “when” and “where”) or business plan (“who” and “what”) instead of a strategic one.

The strategic plan gives you long-term goals and explains “how” your organization will gain a competitive advantage and be the best in your industry. It’s a long-term view. It provides a basis for monitoring progress, and for assessing results and impact. It facilitates new program development and enables your organization to look into the future in an orderly and systematic way. And, most importantly, it’s about grounding your organization in its purpose and values.

With continued global volatility and inflationary pressures building in the marketplace, your organization’s strategic plan should be taking center stage as you move to mitigate potential impacts. Here are our strategic planning best practices to get you started.

6 Strategic Planning Best Practices

1. Create a Collaborative, Inclusive Process

While this may seem obvious, this first step of the strategic planning process is often the hardest. Over-consensus can slow down efforts, but collaboration is at the center of a successful strategic planning process. Creating a strategic plan in a silo is a huge mistake. For a strategy to be successful, you need the right mix of people, and it must be cross-functional. This can include your board or leadership, finance, HR, operations, sales, marketing, and other relevant stakeholders.

It’s important to examine any potential biases that may impact the selection of your collaborators. A great question to challenge your unconscious biases is to ask yourself, “Who does this decision impact?” Answering that question helps you invite the right people to the table who can provide real insight into how you’re going to move forward. The more inclusive and collaborative your process, the more support you’ll have across a diverse set of stakeholders. It also helps ensure that your strategic plan accurately reflects your organization’s vision for the future.

Nobody needs another meeting on their calendar, so schedule your check-ins and working sessions strategically based on what you need to accomplish. Not everybody needs to be at all your meetings. Consider a stakeholder analysis and mapping session to ensure that you have the right representation of voices to move forward on your initiatives.

Next, create a reasonable timeline. If you’ve never done this work before, it could take up to six months. A refresh could take anywhere between four and five weeks. Because strategic planning focuses on the destination and how you’re going to get there, be prepared to spend extra time thinking about who you are and where you want to go as an organization.

2. Operate Off Data — Not Assumptions

Everyone makes assumptions and has preconceived notions about their organization. However, starting the planning process without gathering data will set you up to fail. Without data, it’s easy to create your own reality. Data keeps you honest and increases efficiency. Interpreting data can be uncomfortable – it’s hard not to feel like you’ve failed when the feedback and numbers are telling you that something went (or is) wrong. But gathering and disseminating data isn’t just about your weak spots. It also allows you to wash, rinse, and repeat the areas of strength across your organization.

When gathering data, you’ll need to focus on two aspects: internal and external.

Internal – Is one part of your business growing faster than others? What departments have high rates of turnover? What managers have unhappy or unengaged employees? Who is performing, and where are the gaps? Who and what are overachieving — and how?

– Is one part of your business growing faster than others? What departments have high rates of turnover? What managers have unhappy or unengaged employees? Who is performing, and where are the gaps? Who and what are overachieving — and how? External – Assess the business landscape and what outside factors are playing a role in where your organization is headed. Right now, you may be looking long-term at inflationary pressures and talks of a possible recession. Trade and supply chain issues may also be impactful.

After collecting the data, it’s time to gather more data in the form of feedback. Talk to people. Host focus groups. Review the data you’ve gathered with leadership, industry experts, and your employees. If you don’t understand the “why” behind the feedback, ask follow-up questions. An employee engagement survey is a valuable tool to take the pulse of your internal workforce. Finally, use current data about existing policies and structures to ensure you’re solving current problems.





3. Set an Expectation for Shared Responsibility and Ownership

During the strategic planning process, we often see organizations go as far as appointing a planning committee — but seldom do they give thought to the roles that those in the planning committee will play. Clearly defining expectations for participation is critical to cultivating a planning committee that works well together, is unified toward their common purpose, and delivers on desired outcomes.

Part of this comes down to choosing the right people for the job. The ideal candidate is a team player who is invigorated by the additional opportunity and excited to take ownership. By empowering the right people with clear responsibilities, you’ll create a team of key contributors who readily share their opinions, make decisions, and champion the process from beginning to end.",strategizing new office location
243,6 Office Space Planning Tips for Optimized Workspace ...,https://www.naimichael.com/6-office-planning-tips/,,"6 Office Space Planning Tips for Optimized Workspace Layout

The purpose of workspaces is not only to house employees and equipment. Ideally, a well-designed office should encourage productivity and creative thinking, provide suitable conditions for collaboration, and leave enough room for relaxation and recharging. However, considering how commercial square footage is not cheap, fitting everything into a limited amount of space is often more complex than it seems. So, whether you are searching for a new workspace or looking to redesign your current one, you probably need a few office space planning tips for optimized workspace layout. If that’s the case – you are in luck! This article will let you in on six helpful suggestions that should make this task a bit less headache-inducing.

1. Prioritize comfort

People who spend a lot of their time working in an office understand the importance of comfort. However, more often than not, furniture found in workspaces does not provide much of it. And while you might be tempted to equip your office as affordably as possible, that probably isn’t the best idea. Uncomfortable chairs and desks can significantly decrease productivity and even cause some health issues, which will not only affect your employees but also your business.

To ensure your office furniture is supportive of your team’s posture and overall health, it might be a good idea to opt for ergonomic desk chairs. Look for ones with armrests, comfortable padding, lumbar support, and various adjustment possibilities so that people of all heights, weights, and shapes can fine-tune them according to their liking.

Additionally, make sure to remove any old and unwanted furniture from the office to avoid cluttering up the space. This will help you keep things clean and thus make the workspace more comfortable and professional-looking.

2. Improve lighting

Besides back pain, inadequate lighting in the office is what most employees complain about. And considering how working in a dark environment can negatively affect mood, efficiency, and overall wellbeing, you shouldn’t think twice about improving this aspect of your workspace. However, make sure not to overdo it with artificial lighting as this can be counterproductive.

Plenty of natural light would be ideal, but considering how adding more windows is likely not an option, your best bet would be to add adjustable desk lamps and lighting fixtures. Remember that different sections of the space receive different amounts of light during the day. Therefore, walking around the office and figuring out which parts need improvement is imperative. If, however, you are looking for a new space, make sure to tell your real estate agent what your priorities are.

3. Think about coworking and collaboration

When thinking about office space planning for an optimized work layout, you shouldn’t forget about coworking and collaboration. In most industries, collaboration between employees is a necessity. If your office does not provide suitable conditions for it, overall productivity will likely suffer and decrease. On the other hand, if your employees are able to work together and share ideas without interruptions, their efficiency and creativity will surely reach a new level.

To encourage teamwork, make sure to include a big desk around which everyone can gather. If your space is on the smaller side, consider adding a few comfortable chairs in a circle around a table. Additionally, try to design your office in a way that allows easy interaction between employees while also leaving some room for privacy. Since people have different requirements when it comes to optimizing their productivity, accommodating everyone’s needs is imperative.

4. Include a space for relaxation

If you want your employees to stay productive, including a space with the sole purpose of relaxation is essential. Taking a break during long work hours encourages creative thinking, improves mood and energy levels. Therefore, try to incorporate a room without any work-related equipment where employees can unwind and take their minds off the projects they are working on. Make sure to add a comfy couch and chairs along with a small library, a few board games, or a foosball table. This is where you can let your creativity shine. It might also be a good idea to ask your employees what they would like to have in the little lounge area, as they are the ones who will be using it.

5. Plan with your employees in mind

Planning an optimal workspace layout is important. However, doing so with your employees in mind is essential. An ideal seating plan and the best equipment in the world will not have the same effect on productivity if the people in your office do not feel comfortable in it.

For instance, when decorating your workspace, try not to overdo it with your own taste. Instead, ask the employees to participate by adding their touches to their desks, cubicles, and shared spaces. Make sure to add plants suitable for the amount of light the office gets as they will improve air quality and make the space cozier and more inviting.

Pay attention to the temperature, as well. Offices that are too cold or too hot don’t do much for productivity and employee satisfaction which are crucial aspects of every successful business.

6. Leave room for growth

If you apply these office space planning tips with your employees’ comfort and wellbeing in mind, your business will surely prosper and grow. When that happens, you will need room to expand and accommodate new team members. If your current workspace is not big enough for that, you might need to think about moving to a more suitable location. Luckily, Washington offers many business-friendly spaces and commercial real estate firms that can assist you in your search.

256,6 Steps for a Successful Office Relocation,https://commercialonebrokers.com/6-steps-for-a-successful-office-relocation/,,"Your business has outgrown its current office space, or you want something smaller. It’s time to move. Whether you’re cutting back, rolling out new services, hiring additional employees, or want to be closer to your talent pool, moving to a new location is a chance to solve operational challenges and signal success to your customers.

Determining how to move a business to a new location can be tricky. This is especially so if you’re moving a business to another state. You may have a lot of items to take from one location to another, including: furniture, appliances, computers, inventory, and special equipment.

Planning ahead ensures that your office relocation goes smoothly, reducing downtime for your business. Follow these office moving tips for a successful transition.

1. Make A Timeline

Every business’s move-in timeline is different. You may only have a few months to relocate, or you may have time to plan over the next one to two years.

Much of your time will be spent searching for the right location. If you need a larger office space of 10,000 square feet or more, you need to start searching up to 18 months prior to your lease expiration. Sometimes even small spaces will require 3 to 6 months to find.

Once you’ve found the right real estate, you need to create a timeline to prepare for the move. Set at an obtainable date for your move-in day and work backwards from it. For each month, set a goal for what you need to complete.

An example timeline could look like this:

Six months before: You review your lease, get quotes from moving companies, and start planning other factors of the move.

Three months before: You notify your employees and begin notifying your clients. At this time, you assemble a move-in team, and review the items and equipment you’ll be taking with you.

One month before: You obtain the floor plan from the landlord to visualize the office layout. During this time, you schedule your phone, internet and IT installations.

A few weeks before: You begin labeling inventory and reminding your employees of the deadline to pack up their personal belongings.

2. Review Your Current Lease

Before you make concrete plans, you should review your current lease and speak to your landlord. The terms of your current lease will state what you need to do before your business can relocate.

Leases may include provisions for restoration and maintenance, holdovers, and the landlord’s right to show the space. Restoration clauses may require you to revert any alterations you made to the space before you move out. Other terms may deem you responsible for repairing damage to the property.

After you’ve reviewed your old lease, you’ll want to review your new lease, too. It will state any rules for moving into the new building, like only being able to move in during non-business hours. Reading through both of your leases will keep you from encountering an unexpected surprise down the road.

3. Create A Moving Budget

Moving costs money. Not only will you want to make sure you can afford your new rent, but you will want to make sure you can afford to move. Start allocating money toward your office move and create a budget as early as you can.

Keep in mind that you may need more than a moving company to assist in your office’s move. You may need someone to install equipment, clean the building, or plan the layout.

Your moving expenses may include:

Moving service

Packing supplies

Phone, internet and computer installation

Cleaning service

Interior designer

Landscaping

Security installation

4. Assemble A Team

A successful move relies on good communication and a team of employees willing to take on extra responsibility. This team will keep other employees informed and involved in the moving process.

Assigning a team leader provides a point of contact for all things related to the transition and helps you stick to your timeline. Being a point person for an internal office move is a substantial time commitment. The team leader may need to delegate their normal responsibilities to someone else while they complete tasks for the move.

The team leader needs to receive clear goals and instructions from the decision makers involved. With a clear understanding, they can relay information and assign employees tasks as needed. Businesses often choose a CFO, general counsel, head of facilities or an office manager to spearhead the process.

5. Contract An External Team

You have your internal team. Now, you need an external team. As you approach your move-in date, you should hire people for the services you will need.

Do you need full-service movers, who will pack, load, unload and set up? Do you just need a moving company to take your furniture and equipment? Call a moving company and schedule your moving date in advance so you’re ready to go.

You may need someone to properly disconnect your equipment and technology from your current office, as well as connect your systems once you change locations. Contact your network, systems and security installers a month before your move-in date to get set up in the new location as quickly as possible.

6. Review the Floor Plan

Now that you’re moving into a new office, you have the opportunity to update the layout of your lobby, cubicles and open workspaces. Most landlords can provide you with an architectural floor plan. Having this on hand will help you plan where to place teams in the new space.

It can be difficult to imagine how your current setup will translate into a larger (or smaller) office. You can manipulate a floor plan on an image editor like Adobe Photoshop to give you an idea of how to set up your furniture and teams in the new space. You can also take a floor plan to an office equipment dealer, who will lay out the office plan for free in hopes of earning your future business.

If you want to change the style of your office, you may need to hire an interior designer. They can set up the floor plan, order new furniture and create a space you, your employees and your customers will enjoy.

221,6 Ways to Transform Your Empty Office Space to Make a ...,https://butterflymx.com/blog/empty-office-space/,,"In 2023, more workers than ever before are working remotely. Because of this, thousands of offices are still sitting empty two years after the pandemic left them vacant. At this point, empty offices are nothing but a huge weight on your wallet.

You’re likely wondering how to fill empty office space without selling or requiring a return to in-person work. If so, you should consider transforming your space into a profitable business venture with this guide.

In this post, we’ll go over:

Why empty office space is real estate’s newest market

Two years after the pandemic initially emptied offices around the world, vacancy rates of commercial office spaces stand at 12.3%. Real estate experts at the Wharton School of Business predict many empty office spaces will remain empty for years to come.

What’s more, these experts predict many occupied offices may slowly re-empty as employees demand to work remotely. This means the real estate market will continue to be flooded with empty office space for rent.

But you don’t have to let your office get lost in this oversaturated market! Instead, you can rethink your marketing strategy and revamp your space to incentivize potential tenants to lease with you.

6 ways to profit from your empty office space

Before hurrying to fill your empty office space with desks or selling to another business, remember that not every commercial space needs to be a traditional office. Empty offices can be transformed into on-demand spaces for creatives, remote workers, or small businesses in your community.

Here are six business ideas for empty office spaces:

1. Private events

One byproduct of the pandemic is an increase in people looking for clean places to host events. Event space chains are still an option for hosting birthday parties, baby showers, or banquets. However, these spaces have considerably higher foot traffic than your empty office does.

This means the chances that they’re cleaned completely between events is low. So, partner with a local cleaning company to clean and disinfect your space before and after events.

But before advertising your empty office space as an event space, consider the following:

What types of events would work best in your space?

What upgrades, if any, do you need to make the space appealing to potential customers?

How much time can you dedicate to each event to guarantee set-up and clean-up are possible?

2. Professional development and training

Your tenants may not be bringing workers back to the office yet. But they may still need a space to provide staff training or host large in-person meetings. Similarly, other businesses that have shifted to a fully remote workforce will also occasionally need office space.

So, offer your empty office space to corporations looking to host workshops or occasional in-person work sessions. Additionally, consider renting out conference room space to companies and executives for important meetings.

Pro-tip: Install property technology like the ButterflyMX keypad or video intercom to provide simple access to one-time and recurring visitors.

3. Photography and art studios

Photographers and artists need large, expansive spaces to set up and store equipment, invite clients for consultations, and to produce their work. Your empty office space could be ideal for photographers who need a professional space for a short-term shoot. It can also be perfect for artists who need a small studio area.

Are you thinking of renting out your commercial space to photographers or artists? Consider whether your building has the lighting, storage space, and polished look that these professionals need.

Additionally, consider the return on investment (ROI) of renting to photographers vs. renting to other artists.

Renting to photographers will require short, sometimes daily, rentals for single projects. In order to prevent photoshoots from conflicting, you’ll only be able to rent to one photographer at a time.

Renting to artists, however, will give you longer leases for smaller amounts of space. In fact, many artists will be happy to use shared studio space, as long as they’re guaranteed private storage.

4. Pop-ups

Pop-ups are short-term retail businesses. They’re often seasonal, such as holiday markets. But they can also be one-time brick and mortar stores for ecommerce businesses.

Pop-ups require short-term contracts and are mutually beneficial to you and to local businesses looking to increase revenue and brand awareness.

Before offering your space for pop-ups, consider:

Is there enough parking to accommodate larger crowds?

Does your empty office space have the WiFi needed to facilitate point-of-sale or contactless payments?

Can the building accommodate increased foot traffic?

5. Hot desking

Your empty office space is ideal for hot-desking!

Many offices in the United States report that up to 40% of their desks are empty on any given day. You may not have an entire empty office space, but you likely have entire sections of your commercial building that go unused.

Offering remote workers a chance to rent a seat at your office brings some of that profit your way. What’s more, if business at your commercial office has reopened to a smaller capacity, hot-desking makes use of some of that open space.

Pro-tip: Integrate hot desking in your office space without interrupting the status quo by splitting your space into two. A simple room divider can keep business operations and co-working spaces separate without the need for expensive construction.

6. Renting to other businesses

If you aren’t sure what to do with your empty office space, the simplest option is to offer it up to other businesses. This is the easiest way to earn back the money you’re spending on the space. Because you can offer the space as-is, you won’t need to do any renovations.

Survey the size of your unused space to calculate its rent potential. On one hand, one floor of empty space may be perfect for a small startup. On the other hand, individual unused offices may work for freelancers or legal and insurance representatives who need a small private space.

What to consider before renting an empty commercial space

So, you’ve decided to transform your empty office space in order to turn a profit. But first, you’ll need to consider several factors.

Before you renovate or rent out your empty office space, be sure to do the following:

Evaluate your space: Gather the square footage, facilities, and amenities to consider what kind of solutions will work best in your space. For instance, studios will need good lighting and storage space. Conversely, professional development spaces will need large conference rooms and strong WiFi.

Prepare for theft, property damage, and even injury. Purchase insurance coverage for commercial liability and have any new tenants sign a liability waiver.

Verify legality: Check local laws, codes, and zoning requirements before repurposing your building. And if you don’t own the building, make sure you’re allowed to sublet to others if you plan to rent out empty office space. Always verify local laws about safety, property capacity, inspections, and more before drawing up and signing a contract.

Calculate the cost: Opening your space to the public requires upgrades including new furniture, storage spaces, and cleaning crews. You may also need to pay for client background checks. So, you need to factor these costs into your pricing in order to turn a profit.

Managing access to your transformed empty office space

As you repurpose your office space, you’ll also need to consider how new tenants, clients, visitors, and service providers will access the property. Ultimately, ensuring simple property access will attract and retain new tenants and clients.

ButterflyMX’s smart video intercom and keypad are two perfect access solutions for commercial properties and office spaces. Because both devices are powered by a mobile app, you and your tenants can open the door from a smartphone.

686,6 strategies for breaking into new markets,https://www.worldfirst.com/uk/global-business-expansion/exploring-new-markets/six-strategies-for-breaking-into-new-markets/,,"Domestic success is encouraging; international success is downright riveting. If you’ve done well in the UK, you might decide to try your hand in an international marketplace, too. Breaking into new markets isn’t easy, but if you’re successful, you could boost your company revenue in a big way.

We’ll go over reasons to take your company global at the beginning of this guide. Then, we’ll explore strategies for breaking into a new market — in other words, we’ll arm you with practical ways to expand your business internationally.

Breaking into new markets: strategies for success

Types of markets

The term ‘new market’ is relative — a new market for your business might be an existing market in the UK, or it could be an international market you haven’t explored yet. Several distinct types of market exist:

Existing market: Existing markets are well known and clearly defined. To break into an existing market, you’ll need to challenge established competitors — and you’ll have to demonstrate a compelling value proposition to make progress.

Existing markets are well known and clearly defined. To break into an existing market, you’ll need to challenge established competitors — and you’ll have to demonstrate a compelling value proposition to make progress. Resegmented market: Some innovative companies create new markets by dissecting existing markets. They target a specific niche with a custom product or service and position themselves as a market leader.

Some innovative companies create new markets by dissecting existing markets. They target a specific niche with a custom product or service and position themselves as a market leader. Clone markets: When businesses in one country copy markets in another, they create clone markets. Clone markets are most successful when target consumers don’t speak the same language as people in the original market region.

Why expand into new markets?

Simply put, new markets represent opportunities to extend your brand’s reach, grow your consumer base and make more money. If your industry peers have already broken into new markets, your own expansion will bring you level with them. You may also be able to stay ahead of the curve entirely via foreign expansion.

Many British companies expand into new markets successfully. One example is healthy fast food chain Leon, which initially launched in London in 2004. After capturing a slice of the UK restaurant industry, Leon set its sights on the Netherlands, on Norway and then on Gran Canaria. In 2017, Leon secured £25 in funding from Swiss investment firm Spice Private Equity.

Cost management company Auditel was founded in Britain in 1994 and subsequently expanded into Europe. Landline call blocker manufacturer CPR Global Technology won the Queen’s Award for International Trade only eight years after it launched in 2010. Sporting product manufacturer Net World Sports began trading in the UK in 2009; now, the company operates in more than 100 different countries.

To expand abroad, you’ll need to plan ahead, stay flexible and invest sensibly. You’ll also need to develop an export strategy, and you’ll need to find an international currency transfer partner — WorldFirst, for example — to facilitate cross-border transactions.

How to expand into foreign markets

If you decide that foreign expansion is for you, you can use the following eight-step strategy to plant yourself firmly overseas:

Audit your business: Perform a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis on your company and use the results to create a list of objectives for your organisation. Summarise your USP: Outline your unique selling proposition, and conduct market research to see if your product will perform well in your target country. If not, can you target somewhere else instead? Complete a competitive analysis: Define direct competitors in the foreign marketplace and perform a competitive analysis to assess your peers’ strengths and weaknesses. Create a budget: Make a list of potential expenses for your foreign expansion endeavour. Include equipment costs, technology expenses, shipping and warehousing costs, postage costs, consultant fees and other unique costs. Set goals: Use your competitive analysis results and your knowledge of the target market and the infrastructure in the foreign country to create a realistic list of waymarkers and goals for your expansion strategy. Cement your logistics plan: Create a shipping and warehousing strategy to move products into your target market and consider how you can shorten lag times during delivery. Set up your online presence: Design and deploy your website, set up your marketplace seller accounts and create product and service content for consumers in your target market. Make sure you translate packaging and product descriptions for non-English speaking customers Go live and track results: Make your strategy live and track key performance indicators (KPIs) to monitor the results of your expansion strategy over time.

Breaking into new markets: strategies for success

According to research by business support service Newable, more than 6 in 10 UK-based SMEs were ready to adopt an international growth strategy in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic struck not long after Newable published its survey, throwing plans into turmoil for the rest of the year and a substantial portion of 2021.

Could 2022 represent a new beginning for foreign expansion? We think so. With that in mind, here are six practical strategies you can use to extend your reach beyond UK borders.

Strategy 1: Follow your customers

At first glance, foreign markets seem completely unfamiliar. Overseas consumers have different cultural traditions, prefer different brands and have different seasonal shopping habits. It can feel intimidating to make connections and build consumer relationships in new markets. On the one hand, foreign expansion represents a fresh start; on the other, it’s a lot of work.

If you’re a B2B enterprise, one solution is to follow your existing customers into new marketplaces. Some of the people you already do business with probably have contacts in countries you want to break into. You can leverage those connections to your advantage.

Some companies actively seek to involve themselves in client expansion strategies. If you do this, you can limit your risk and assess foreign markets before you commit to your own expansion plans. Referrals from existing clients can also help you build a good reputation — and a solid customer base — in an unfamiliar country.

Strategy 2: Create connections

If you’re lacking existing connections, build new ones. A full 85% of respondents to a recent Bizzabo survey said that in-person conferences and meetings were a critical part of business success. Perhaps surprisingly, 61% of participants felt that face-to-face events were their most critical business marketing channel.

Kara Krause, SVP of Event Marketing and Communications at E.J. Krause & Associates, agrees. According to Krause, in-person events are much better for business relationship development than virtual events. Virtual events, while convenient, lead to ‘Zoom fatigue’ and disengagement, while in-person events trigger communication and collaboration.

As recovery from the pandemic continues, hybrid and live events will almost certainly increase in frequency. You can use webinars, in-person meetings and hybrid conferences to boost brand awareness and strengthen international connections in advance of overseas expansion. Consider setting up ‘lunch and learn’ events with potential distributors in foreign markets, for instance.

It’s important to recognise where connection-building lies on the client-acquisition scale. Face-to-face meetings don’t have to be high-stakes events. Instead of focusing on closing deals, use in-person meetings to build rapport and connect with potential customers. Think of workshops and brainstorming sessions as strategic exercises — top-of-the-funnel opportunities to network.

Strategy 3: Focus on service

A new market is the business equivalent of a clean slate, which can be a blessing and a curse. Benefits of breaking into new markets include a greater number of potential customers; drawbacks include a lack of consumer product knowledge and general unfamiliarity with your company.

Some organisations try to disperse product knowledge fog by bombarding consumers in new marketplaces with information. Education is part of the battle, but it’s not everything. Companies that use client-centric strategies to develop relationships with consumers instead of focusing exclusively on explaining product benefits often find breaking into new markets easier.

Relationship-building is a long-term strategy for success. Strong relationships with clients — especially in new markets — often improve customer retention rates, and can also help to increase average order value (AOV). Later on, loyal customers are likely to tell other people about your company or your product, thus helping to build your customer base.

Let’s segue back to virtual and in-person events for a moment. When you attend or host webinars, conferences or workshops, you increase your exposure in the local market. The more popular you become, the more likely you are to connect with well-known business partners — and when brands work together, they often elevate each others’ profiles.

Look for opportunities to sponsor or co-sponsor events or teams in your target marketplace. You could donate products to a charity fundraiser raffle, sponsor a sports team or attend a trade show, for instance. A smart marketing strategy, sponsorship boosts your company image — and reputation is doubly important in a new market.

Strategy 5: Concentrate on customer experience (CX)

According to a recent study by professional services network PricewaterhouseCoopers, people are willing to spend 16% more on a brand in exchange for a better customer experience. Further research agrees: when software company Oracle surveyed business leaders for its 2019 Global CX Insights Report, 90% of respondents indicated that CX was the top priority.

In a nutshell, CX describes the customer experience from the top of your sales funnel to the bottom. CX begins with awareness — specifically, awareness of your company and of the products you sell — and it ends when consumers exit the sales funnel, or when they stop doing repeat business with you. When customers have positive experiences, they tell friends and family members, further building brand awareness.

It’s important not to forget existing customers when you create your global development strategy. After all, some of the clients you already serve might also do business in the foreign markets you plan to expand into. Focusing on current customers as well as new prospects can help you improve your CX and make a bigger impact abroad.

Clearly CX is an important focus in both the domestic marketplace and in international marketplaces. If your UK-centric business development plan doesn’t currently focus on CX, consider revisiting and honing your domestic strategy before expanding into foreign markets.

Strategy 6: Hire an expert

Hiring an expert — a global marketing specialist, for example — can help you build a better expansion plan. Global marketing specialists know all about consumer trends, local traditions and idiosyncrasies in international marketplaces. They use that experience to help clients craft effective marketing strategies.

Market entry and global expansion consultants offer similar services; global market strategists provide clients with financial advice about international matters. Meanwhile, companies like WorldFirst have a deep and long-standing connection with Asia — specifically China — and can facilitate cross-border payments quickly and easily. When you hire a global expert of any kind, you pay for knowledge you don’t currently have — and that can be priceless.

Reduce expenses and streamline payments with WorldFirst

International expansion can make outgoing and inbound payments a little more complicated. When funds cross borders and currencies need converting, costs often accrue very quickly.

Traditionally, international merchants used banks to make payments to recipients overseas; unfortunately, wire transfers are an expensive way to move money. Alternative third-party payment options are another solution, but associated fees are sometimes unpredictable and opaque.

WorldFirst is an alternative to both traditional banks and standard third-party payment partners. WorldFirst products are designed for businesses, rather than individuals, so you can set exchange rates well in advance with hedging solutions.

253,7 Tips for Choosing Your Next Office Location,https://www.commercialcafe.com/blog/choosing-office-location-7-tips/,,"Before you jump in the car and start driving around town looking for your next office location, you should have a clear idea of what you’re looking for. Putting together a game plan takes some time and effort, but it will pay off in the long run. That’s because while many business mistakes can be corrected, choosing the wrong space for your business can be an expensive mistake that’s particularly difficult to fix.

Top things to consider when scouting for an office location

Here’s a list of the top seven factors to consider when choosing your next office location:

#1 Your client demographics

The office location you choose isn’t just about your needs. Where you decide to reside should also take into consideration the market segment your clients come from.

If your client base is made up of millennials, mixed-use office space in the central business district might be a good choice. On the other hand, a suburban space with plenty of parking may be more suitable if your customers are baby boomers or gen-Xers with kids.

#2 Easily accessible

Maybe you’ve found an office space that doesn’t break the budget. The only problems are parking is tight, mass transit isn’t anywhere to be found, there’s no foot traffic, and it takes forever to get to. The harder it is for clients and staff to get to your office location, the tougher it will be to attract new business and retain your employees.

#3 Total cost of renting

The true cost of renting office space can vary widely from one location to the next. In addition to the base rent, taxes and zoning rules and regulations can make a seemingly affordable location unexpectedly expensive. Also, don’t forget to investigate potential economic incentives the local government offers to help offset your costs.

#4 Safety and security

Bright exterior lighting, direct access to the building from the underground parking garage, a reception area staffed 24/7, or keycard access are all great safety features. However, take some time to investigate a little bit more before signing a lease. Research local crime data by going online or giving the local police precinct a call, and speak with other business owners in the area to learn more about break-ins and vandalism.

#5 Competition

Competition can be bad, but sometimes it can also help your business grow. For example, if your business is social media marketing and there are three other firms that do the exact same thing in your office building, odds are you’ll lose some existing clients and staff to a competitor.

On the other hand, if a neighboring business compliments what you do, it’ll help your firm grow and prosper. That’s why car dealers are usually located side-by-side. They all sell cars, but the make and model of the ride are completely different.

#6 Amenities and infrastructure

Nearby amenities like great restaurants and clubs can be important if you frequently wine-and-dine your clients. Onsite daycare can also be important if you or your staff bring their kids to the office.

Infrastructure needs for your new office location include factors like floorplan layout and the environment the space provides. Some businesses want an open plan, while others need private offices for confidential client work. Other key infrastructure features include phone and internet, mail and delivery services, and kitchens and bathrooms.

#7 Your business image

It helps to think of your office space as a marketing tool. Does the location match the business image that you’re trying to convey?

Look at your new office location from the eyes of your clients and staff. If you’re in the high tech business, a warehouse that’s been rehabbed into loft office space could be the perfect match. However, if you’re targeting white-collar clients, a traditional office building or downtown coworking space might be the better choice.

Factors that are often overlooked when choosing an office location

Now that you’ve found an office space that checks all of the above boxes, take time out for a reality check. Here are a few more factors to think about when choosing the right location for your office that many tenants – and even their leasing brokers – forget to investigate:

Extra meeting room space: because sometimes it’s better to have a few smaller conference rooms than a single big one;

Employee engagement sounds simple but goes deep. A good employee engagement strategy improves the likelihood that the relationship between the employee and the organization will be positive in nature. Engaged employees:

Are self-motivated

Have a clear understanding of their roles

Recognize the significance of their contribution

Focus on future training and development

Feel that they belong to a community—that is, the organization

The Benefits of an Engaged Workforce

Effective employee engagement results in more motivation and better job satisfaction, and thus, a lower cost-to-value ratio for your human personnel expenditure. It goes like this: While every employee adds to the bottom line, engaged employees add that much more.

This idea, also known as the service-profit chain, was introduced by Harvard researchers in the 1990s that traces business profitability and customer loyalty right back to engaged, motivated employees.

Top corporate leaders know that engaged employees can help raise productivity, increase profits, enhance customer experience, foster brand loyalty, and facilitate growth.

The Best Employee Engagement Strategies

Below, you’ll find an outline of the steps you can take in order to ensure that the employees achieve a positive emotional connection with the organization and the work they’re assigned to do. In essence, there are three main parts:

Physical: The level of complexity of work corresponds to the employees’ skill set.

Emotional: Employees understand the job’s significance and put their heart into it.

Mental: Employees become engrossed with their work.

1. Hire With Engagement in Mind

The decisions you make during the hiring process can lead to different results in the engagement of an individual employee as well as workforce engagement across the organization.

Every new hire you make has the possibility to impact how employees interact with each other, either strengthening the values of your organization or detracting from the work culture.

A successful hire occurs when a new employee aligns with the organization in many different aspects, including job details as well as the company’s overall culture.

Salary: Your new employee’s salary expectations should match what the company can unfailingly offer.

Values: Your new hire should respect how the organization operates to attain its goals.

Competency: The new hire should have the skills to meet the responsibilities of the position.

Culture: The new hires should possess personal and emotional skills to be on the same page with their new colleagues and management.

This doesn’t just impact current employees; new hires should be adequately prepared for their new positions, too. According to a Jobvite survey, 43% of new hires leave their jobs in the first 90 days as they felt that the role described during the process of hiring wasn’t what they experienced when they began to work.

Your newest employees will evaluate their experience more carefully during the initial few weeks with your business. If you are able to provide what you promised during the hiring process, it will deepen that initial good impression and make way for employee engagement.

2. Streamline Onboarding

Developing a comprehensive onboarding program can be a powerful way to improve employee engagement and support the success of new hires. A good onboarding program should:

Introduce new hires to the company's mission, values, and culture: Help new hires understand the company's purpose and how they fit into the organization.

Orient new hires to the organization: Provide an overview of the company's structure, processes, and systems.

Connect new hires with resources and support: Ensure that new hires have access to the resources and support they need to be successful, such as training materials, a mentor, or a go-to person for questions.

Provide opportunities for socialization: Help new hires get to know their coworkers and build relationships within the organization.

Set clear expectations: Communicate expectations around performance, attendance, and other aspects of the job.

Assess progress and provide feedback: Regularly check in with new hires to assess their progress and provide feedback to help them succeed.

Your new hires are only learning to navigate the complexity and will need assistance in specific areas. Thus, your first step should be to understand their viewpoint and work towards offering an onboarding experience that will keep them engaged.

According to data from ServiceNow, organizations that offer inadequate onboarding programs have twice the chance of facing employee turnover. The first impression is crucial and will have a significant impact on new employees’ expectations.

3. Clarify the Company's Mission

By making the mission a central part of the corporate culture, employees are more likely to feel aligned with the company's goals and motivated to contribute to its success. When employees know the overarching goals and values of the organization, they can see how their individual roles contribute to larger objectives.

To effectively communicate the company mission, management should integrate it into all aspects of the workplace, from onboarding sessions and training programs to regular team meetings and company communications.

Leaders should consistently emphasize and relate back to the mission in daily interactions and decision-making processes, helping employees connect their tasks to the company's broader goals.

Additionally, creating opportunities for employees to engage directly with mission-related projects or community initiatives can reinforce their commitment and understanding of the company's purpose.

4. Set SMART Goals and an Action Plan

Without any goals, an organization doesn’t have a direction to follow. What does it want to achieve? What does it need to improve? What is the role of the strategy? All these questions need to be answered first.

Moreover, the goals that you set need to be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely—that is, S.M.A.R.T. With tangible outcomes in mind, managers will be able to properly execute the strategy and figure out whether it is following the expected results or not

Once the particular goals are in place, prepare an action plan on how to attain them. At this stage, the allocation of resources and definition of key performance indicators (KPIs) are taken care of to facilitate the measurement of progress.

The effectiveness of the action plan is the responsibility of the direct supervisors. Employee engagement rates soar when they distribute the results and propose future endeavors.

One of the ways to ensure this is to let your employees know how significant their contribution is. There are different ways on how to do staff recognition. Tell them how it is helping in achieving the organization’s business objectives. Simply speaking, organizations need to start making their employees feel that they matter.

5. Be People-Centric

Employees are not robots; they are human. Organizations that tend to see employees as a commodity, but your employees are not another factor of production. They are prospective champions of your organization’s values and principles.

Companies can become more people-centric by prioritizing employee well-being and development at the core of their business strategies. Actively listen to employee needs and feedback, providing comprehensive support systems like mental health resources, career development opportunities, and flexible working conditions.

6. Create an Office Environment Conducive to Work

Giving employees a space that enhances productivity and satisfaction involves ensuring that all employees have the necessary tools, information, and training to perform their jobs effectively.

First, the physical workspace should be designed to promote focus and efficiency. This means organizing workstations to minimize noise and distractions, providing ergonomic furniture, and ensuring that the office is well-lit and temperature-controlled. Adequate technology and resources, such as high-speed internet, modern computers, and effective communication tools, should be readily available to all team members.

Second, maintain an open line of communication where employees can easily access the information they need and feel comfortable requesting additional support. This can be facilitated through a well-structured intranet, regular team meetings, and clear documentation of workflows and policies.

7. Offer Remote and Flexible Work

Offering flexible work hours can be a powerful way to improve employee engagement and foster a positive work culture. Here are a few benefits of offering flexible hours:

Improved work-life balance

Increased productivity

Greater employee retention

Improved morale

There are a few different ways you can offer flexible work hours, such as allowing employees to choose their own work schedule within certain parameters, offering flexible start and end times, or allowing employees to work remotely.

8. Promote a Strong Company Culture

By prioritizing a positive and inclusive company culture, organizations can create a workplace where employees feel valued and inspired to contribute their best work.

A strong company culture is built on clear values that are actively practiced and integrated into every aspect of the organization, from hiring practices to day-to-day operations and decision-making processes.

Management should lead by example, embodying the company's values in their actions and communications. Regularly celebrating achievements that align with these values, such as teamwork, innovation, or customer service, can reinforce their importance.

Additionally, creating opportunities for employees to connect with one another, such as team-building activities, social events, and collaborative projects, strengthens interpersonal relationships and fosters a supportive community.

Lastly, encouraging open communication and feedback through town hall meetings, suggestion boxes, and regular check-ins can help maintain transparency and ensure that the culture evolves in a way that continues to meet the needs of its employees.

9. Establish a Sense of Community

An organization is essentially a community; each member fulfills a specific task and serves the community as a whole. To encourage this community spirit among your employees, any engagement activity can help, from organizing a big annual event to simply taking a team out to lunch.

Notwithstanding the hierarchy of the organization, it’s better to maintain a certain level of equality and unbiasedness where everyone feels they are important to the community.

This philosophy is typical in the new-age technology startups where they adopt a more casual, no-walls organizational policy. Though sustaining this new business approach might be tricky, it can lead to highly engaged staff.

10. Recognize Employee Contributions

Two out of three employees feel they do not get enough recognition for their work, according to Office Team data reported by Forbes. As a result, most employees will not deliver their maximum potential and may engage in unwanted behavior. And highly-trained and qualified talent will always be looking for better job offers.

For this reason, it’s wise to create a recognition-rich environment where good work is rewarded with perks and incentives. At the very least, a few good words and a certificate of appreciation can go a long way in letting others feel valued for their work.

11. Invest in Career Development

For many, just coming to the office, doing the work assigned, and taking the paycheck back home isn’t enough. They need to know there are sufficient growth prospects for the role they are fulfilling. If your employees feel that you don’t care about their professional development, they may begin to look for work elsewhere.

Whether it’s by running a proprietary training program or sponsoring higher education for your employees, you are not only investing in the future of your company but also creating a sense of loyalty among your employees.

Remember, every employee loves a company that supports them in their professional career and adds value to their personal lives. Want to retain top-notch talent in your organization? Ensure their professional growth and you will reap the benefits.

Providing opportunities for employee development can be a powerful way to improve employee engagement and drive better outcomes for your business. Here are a few strategies you might consider:

Offer training and development programs: Workshops, seminars, or online courses help employees learn new skills or advance their careers.

Encourage continuous learning: Learning opportunities outside of formal training programs can include attending conferences, participating in webinars, or taking online courses.

Set up mentorship programs: Match employees with experienced mentors who can provide guidance and support as they learn and grow.

Provide opportunities for career advancement: Offer opportunities for employees to take on new challenges and responsibilities, such as leading a team or taking on a new role within the organization.

Promote self-directed learning: Encourage employees to take ownership of their own development by providing them with resources and support to pursue their own learning goals.

12. Hire Quality People Managers

Your secret weapon to spur employee engagement is the managers—they are the middlemen between boardroom members and the employees. In most cases, the employees interact with the top-level executives rarely, if ever, but have daily interactions with their immediate bosses. Whether they are feeling secure, angry, or ignored depends on how you manage employees.

Gallup’s chairman, Jim Clifton, once said: “Employees—especially the stars—join a company and then quit their manager. It may not be the manager's fault so much as these managers have not been prepared to coach the new workforce.”

While organizations can choose to educate their managers on how to better engage their employees, it’s always better to hire a capable manager first. Check their professional background and try to see if they are suited for the tricky job waiting for them.

13. Introduce Team-Building Activities

Team-building activities can be a great way to improve employee engagement and foster a positive work culture. Here are a few ideas for team-building activities that you might consider:



Trust-building exercises: Some of the examples include ""Human Knot"" or the ""Trust Fall.""

Communication challenges: Activities that require team members to communicate effectively can help improve collaboration.

Problem-solving activities: Examples might include ""Escape the Room"" or ""Mars Mission.""

Outdoor activities: Getting team members out of the office can help them bond and have fun together. It can include a team hiking or camping trip, or a group outing to a ropes course or other adventure activity.

Creative activities: This can be in the form of painting or art competitions, singing and dancing events, etc.



It's important to choose activities that are appropriate for your team and that align with your goals for employee engagement.

14. Provide Incentives for Work Achievement

Incentives can be a powerful tool for motivating and engaging employees. Here are a few ideas for incentives that you might consider

Monetary rewards: bonuses, pay raises, and other financial incentives

Time off: offering additional vacation days or flexible work arrangements

Recognition: publicly recognize and praise employees for their hard work or send a hand-written note

Professional development opportunities: training programs, mentorship opportunities, or professional certification courses.

Special perks: reserved parking spot or a choice of office location

Another option: a recognition and employee rewards solution, like Workmates. Our solution is customizable and offers a unique set of advantages, as an ideal recognition solution. Workmates increase employee engagement and boost productivity in the workplace.

15. Encourage Collaboration

Encouraging collaboration can be a powerful way to improve employee engagement and drive better outcomes for your business. Here are a few strategies you might consider:

Encourage employees from different departments or teams to work together on projects or tasks. This can help break down silos and foster a sense of teamwork.

Encourage employees to share ideas and feedback with one another, and create a culture where it's safe to speak up and share perspectives.

Host team-building activities or outings that encourage employees to get to know one another and work together in a more relaxed setting.

Encourage a culture of collaboration and teamwork by recognizing and rewarding team contributions and successes.

Utilize tools like project management software, virtual meeting platforms, and online collaboration spaces to make it easier for employees to work together and share ideas.

16. Facilitate Two-Way Communication

Top business leaders generally believe in the open door policy and do not use “top-secret” information to their advantage. If organizations act secretive and only divulge information on a “need-to-know” basis, it will likely cause lower engagement rates among their employees.

Transparency begets trust when employees understand how corporate decisions affect the workplace.

But simply disseminating information isn’t enough. Communication should go two ways—the employees should be encouraged to share their concerns so they don’t feel ignored or unvalued. Here are a few strategies that can help your organization:

Create a culture where it's safe for employees to share their ideas, concerns, and feedback. This might involve setting aside dedicated time for open discussions or establishing a suggestion box where employees can anonymously share ideas.

Encourage employees to communicate openly and honestly with one another and with management. This might involve creating dedicated channels for communication, such as a team chat platform or a suggestion forum.

Be open and transparent with employees about company goals, plans, and challenges.

Regularly solicit feedback from employees and actively listen to their ideas and concerns. This might involve hosting team meetings or one-on-one conversations with employees.

As a leader, model open and honest communication by being approachable and transparent in your own communication style.

17. Utilize HR Software

Implementing HR software can be a powerful way to improve employee engagement and streamline HR processes. Here are a few ways that HR software can support employee engagement:

HR software can help automate and streamline HR processes, such as payroll, benefits management, and time and attendance tracking. This can help reduce the administrative burden for HR staff and free up more time for engagement and development efforts.

Many HR software platforms offer features such as team chat, task management, and document sharing, which can help facilitate communication and collaboration among employees.

HR software can provide employees with access to self-service tools, such as a portal for viewing and updating personal information or requesting time off. This can help empower employees and improve their overall experience with HR.

Some HR software platforms offer tools for setting and tracking performance goals, which can help employees stay focused and motivated.

Many HR software platforms offer features such as learning management systems, which can help employees access training materials and track their progress.

18. Conduct Employee Surveys

Circulate questionnaires and surveys that permit your employees to express their opinions and concerns. The more you ask for their opinions, the more they feel esteemed, entitled, respected, and like they belong to the organization.

Conduct the survey in such a way that it will yield the most thoughtful, timely responses. The catch here is to keep the surveys short and conduct frequent employee-pulse surveys. This lets employees think properly and reply at a higher rate.

Additionally, it’s a great idea to build a habit of transparency and share the results. Sharing all the data collected from surveys will demonstrate transparency and help you to engage employees.

19. Engage Departing Employees

Offer appropriate transparency when offboarding an employee. Each will have their own reasons why they depart. The appropriate details provided by the team members when they depart can aid the rest of the employees in processing the change without making cynical guesswork.

Apart from that, recognize your employees’ reasons why they are leaving voluntarily. When you understand and categorize the reasons employees leave, it will help your organization to improve.

If any engaged employees are leaving voluntarily, stay connected with them. You can consider curating alumni networks to be in contact with past employees. It will give you access to expanded networking and employment opportunities. Plus, it might make some employees come back to your organization with new skills and experiences when new positions open up.

99,8 Features of a Modern Office Setting: Design,https://blog.gebesa.com/en-us/features-of-a-modern-office,,"Color, lighting, open spaces, and decoration, among others, are some of the characteristics of modern offices.

Workspaces are no longer based only on the number of workers, they are also based on adapting to them to improve their stay, creativity, and, of course, productivity.

Many companies maintain the motto ""healthy employees are happy employees"" and under this premise, the design of modern offices depends largely on the needs and functions of users. In addition to providing all the comforts for collaborators to develop their activities, they also put companies at the forefront positively reflecting their culture, both internally and externally.

May you be interested in Modern Office Equipment Trends 2024

Why are modern offices more productive?

The success of modern office design is due to 4 main reasons:

1. Reduce talent loss

Both your collaborators and new candidates will prefer to remain in a place where they feel comfortable and valued.

Designing and decorating the office to improve their wellbeing will reduce the risk of losing staff due to health problems or poor working space conditions.

This includes furniture, decoration, lighting, workplace layout, etc.

All of these characteristics have a direct influence on work productivity and can have an impact on attracting and retaining talent, too.

2. Promote collaborative work

The philosophy of modern offices focuses on diminishing individual areas to promote teamwork in shared spaces.

This accentuates interaction and decreases tension between employees, which favors communication between departments and has a direct impact on the results obtained.

3. Encourage workers' creativity

Elements such as light, color, and decoration are essential to inspire your collaborators.

Rest and recreation areas, for example, are ideal for taking a break and allow employees to return to their activities, motivated and recharged.

4. Improves corporate identity

Redesigning your workspace into a modern office not only improves the performance of your employees but also helps you communicate the values of your organization.

Personalizing the office will make ideas flow more easily and help the business grow.

8 modern office features of design

Now, from theory to practice, how to design modern offices?

If we look at offices from 20 years ago, we see a clear evolution in the furniture, its distribution, decoration, colors, and concept.

Offices were smaller, with cubicles separating one laborer from another, and farther away you could find the place the director stayed, without shared spaces. Today, this is no longer the case.

372,8 Keys to Good Financial Plans,https://www.schwab.com/financial-planning-collection/8-components-of-good-financial-plan,,"While there are many ways to go about developing a financial plan—do it yourself, use a robo-advisor, work with a financial planner, or a combination thereof—Schwab has identified eight critical components every plan should include, regardless of the method used to create it. So, what does a good financial plan look like?

1. Setting financial goals

You can't make a financial plan until you know what you want to accomplish with your money—so whether you're creating it yourself or working with a professional, your plan should start with a list of your goals, both big and small, and the time horizons to accomplish them. Doing so can help to organize each objective by how soon you'll need the money:

Short-term goals are those you hope to achieve in the next five years, such as paying off debt or building an emergency fund.

Medium-term goals are those you hope to achieve in the next five to 10 years, such as the down payment on a home or starting your own business.

Long-term goals are those that are 10 or more years away, including saving for college and, of course, retirement.

For each goal, specify a dollar figure and a target date. ""The more specific your goals, the easier it is to measure your progress toward them,"" said Rob Williams, managing director of financial planning at the Schwab Center for Financial Research.

A host of online tools can help you run the numbers, weigh competing priorities, and determine the best course of action for you. Also, if you have multiple goals to work toward, a robo-advisor, or automated investing platform, can help you weigh the importance of each goal, ranking them by needs, wants, and wishes.

Any time is a good time to establish a financial plan.

Ideally, you start investing for financial goals early in life, but any time is a good time to check in on your current financial situation and assess how you're doing. Are you still on track? Do you have other goals you hadn't previously considered? Having a financial plan helps you assess where you are today and where you want to go next.

2. Net worth statement

Knowing your net worth today can serve as a baseline for framing your financial goals and setting a target for your net worth at some point in the future, like in retirement. To determine your net worth, make a list of all your assets (bank and investment accounts, real estate, valuable personal property) and another one of all your debt (credit cards, mortgages, or student loans). Your assets minus your liabilities equals your net worth.

""Don't be discouraged if your liabilities outweigh your assets,"" Rob said. ""That's not uncommon when you're just starting out—especially if you have a mortgage and student loans.""

3. Budget and cash flow planning

Your budget is really where the rubber meets the road, planning-wise. It can help you determine where your money is going each month and where you can cut back to meet your goals.

A budget calculator can help ensure you don't overlook irregular but important expenses, such as car repairs, out-of-pocket health care costs, and real estate taxes. As you're compiling your list, separate your expenses into two buckets: must-have items like groceries and rent, and nice-to-haves like eating out and gym memberships.

When considering how your goals fit into your budget, you may want to pressure-test it using ""what if"" scenarios: What if you want or need to retire earlier? What if you downsized your mortgage? Some robo-advisors offer tools that allow you to adjust certain assumptions to see how they could affect your savings strategy.

4. Debt management plan

Debt is sometimes treated like a four-letter word, but not all debt is bad debt. A mortgage, for example, can help build equity—and boost your credit score in the bargain. High-interest consumer debt like credit cards, on the other hand, can weigh heavily on your credit score. Plus, every dollar you pay in finance charges and interest is one you can't put toward other goals.

If you have high-interest debt, make sure you create a plan that can help you pay it off as quickly as possible. If you're not sure where to start, a financial advisor can help you prioritize, then determine how much of your budget should go toward your debt each month.

5. Retirement plan

An old guideline says you'll need approximately 80% of your present income in retirement. However, this assumes that retiring will free you from any work-related expenses, that you've paid off your mortgage, that any children will be financially independent, and you'll likely fall into a lower tax bracket.

It's also important to keep in mind that Medicare doesn't cover everything, and health care expenses that Medicare doesn't cover—such as long-term care—can add up quickly. You also might spend more on other things in retirement, like travel, dining out, gifts, or financial support to a relative or friend.

Plugging in different scenarios into a retirement savings calculator can help you figure out what you may need in retirement.

Don't count on the 80% rule

If you're saving 20% – 30% of your pre-retirement income, then the 80% income-replacement rule is a good place to start. Otherwise, it's safer to aim at covering 100% of your pre-retirement income, minus whatever you're saving for retirement. As with any general rule, there are plenty of exceptions. So be sure to sit down and fine-tune your retirement budget as the time draws near. This should be your top priority because you can borrow for most other goals but not for retirement.

6. Emergency funds

When something unexpected happens—say you lose your job or get hit with an unexpected medical bill—an emergency fund can help you avoid tapping your long-term savings to make ends meet.

It's generally a good idea to save enough to cover at least three months'—but ideally six months'—worth of essential living expenses (for example, groceries, housing, transportation, and utilities). Save this money in a checking or savings account so you can access it in a hurry should the need arise.

7. Insurance coverage

Insurance is an important part of protecting your financial downside—but try to ensure you're not overpaying for coverage you don't need and make sure to cover all your bases:

Health insurance : Without it, even routine care can cost a pretty penny, while a serious injury or hospital stay could set you back tens of thousands of dollars. As you get older, you may want to consider long-term care insurance, as well.

: Without it, even routine care can cost a pretty penny, while a serious injury or hospital stay could set you back tens of thousands of dollars. As you get older, you may want to consider long-term care insurance, as well. Disability insurance : This coverage protects you and your family in case you're unable to work. Employer-provided disability insurance typically replaces about 60% of your salary.

Auto and homeowners'/renters' insurance : If you own a car or home—or rent and can't afford to replace possessions out of pocket—make sure you're adequately protected.

: If you own a car or home—or rent and can't afford to replace possessions out of pocket—make sure you're adequately protected. Life insurance: This is generally a good idea for those with dependents. Work with an insurance agent to understand what type of—and how much—coverage makes the most sense for you.

8. Estate plan

At a minimum, most people want a will in place, which states your final wishes with regards to your assets, dependents, and who you want to administer your estate. You should also keep the beneficiaries of your insurance policies and retirement accounts up to date. Also consider establishing powers of attorney for financial and health care decisions, in case you become incapacitated.

Here are some key elements to consider when developing an innovation strategy:

Identify the areas of focus : Determine the areas where innovation is needed most, whether it's developing new products or services, improving existing ones, or creating new processes or technologies.

Empower Employees to Generate and Pursue New Ideas

Creating a culture of innovation means giving employees the freedom and resources to generate and pursue new ideas. This requires a shift away from traditional hierarchical structures and towards a more collaborative and inclusive approach.

To empower employees to generate and pursue new ideas, organizations can:

Build a culture of open communication where employees feel comfortable sharing their ideas and thoughts without fear of judgment or retribution.

Give employees the tools and resources they need to pursue new ideas, such as time, funding, and access to technology.

Encourage collaboration across different departments and teams to bring diverse perspectives and expertise to the innovation process.

Celebrate and recognize employees who generate and pursue innovative ideas, whether they are successful or not.

Encourage employees to take calculated risks and experiment with new ideas, knowing that failure is a necessary part of the innovation process.

By empowering employees to generate and pursue new ideas, you can tap into your workforce's collective creativity and expertise. This can lead to new and innovative products, services, and processes that can drive success and growth for the company.

Create Psychological Safety

In 2012, Google tried to discover the key factors behind successful teams.

The company thoroughly examined various aspects of teamwork, such as leadership, frequency of off-work meetings, and the personality traits of team members.

After analyzing the data, the study revealed that the most crucial element for team performance was psychological safety, where each team member could freely express their ideas without any fear of criticism or revenge.

One way to promote psychological safety is to encourage regular team meetings where everyone can share their progress, challenges, and ideas. Leaders can also facilitate brainstorming sessions and encourage team members to think creatively and critically without any judgment.

Companies should also invest in training and development programs focusing on emotional intelligence and effective communication. These programs can help team members better understand and manage their emotions, build relationships, and communicate more effectively.

Remove Unnecessary Bureaucracy

Bureaucracy can stifle innovation in two significant ways. Bureaucratic processes can create long lag times, which can result in missed opportunities for innovation. For example, a lengthy approval process can delay the implementation of a new idea, making it irrelevant by the time it is finally approved.

What's more, bureaucracy often reinforces the status quo and resists change, making it difficult for new and innovative ideas to gain traction. This can be especially true in large organizations, where established processes and procedures can be difficult to change.

Bureaucratic processes can also lead to a lack of ownership over innovation, with decision-making and implementation often spread across multiple departments and teams. This can make it challenging to take risks and experiment with new ideas.

One way of removing unnecessary bureaucracy is by implementing a flatter hierarchy. Flatter hierarchies reduce layers of management to create a more agile and responsive company. This can be achieved by eliminating unnecessary levels of management, empowering teams to make decisions, and promoting a culture of collaboration and teamwork.

Let Information Flow Freely

Transparency within a company is necessary for building a culture of innovation. In addition to knowing the company's top priorities, transparency also breeds trust. Trust, in turn, breeds both engagement and personal connections. Taken together, they encourage creative thinking and the confidence to share those ideas and work with teammates to bring them to life.

One of the ways to promote transparency and let information flow freely is to use collaboration tools that make information accessible and visible to everyone in the company. Instead of putting strategies and plans in Word docs tucked away on a private network drive, consider using tools like Confluence or other wiki-style software that will be open for anyone to discover, read, and comment on.

Doing so will create a culture of open communication where employees can share ideas, feedback, and concerns without fear of retribution. You'll also encourage employees to engage with each other and with the company by making information and resources easily accessible and available.

Encourage Cross-Functional Collaboration

Innovation often requires collaboration across teams, units, and divisions within a company. Cross-functional collaboration can bring together diverse perspectives and expertise to drive innovation and find creative solutions to complex problems.

To encourage cross-functional collaboration, companies can:

Provide opportunities for employees from different teams and departments to work together on projects and initiatives.

Promote a culture of collaboration by recognizing and rewarding cross-functional teamwork and creating an environment where employees feel comfortable working with others outside their immediate team or department.

Encourage collaboration by breaking down silos and eliminating barriers between teams and departments. This can be achieved by encouraging open communication and providing opportunities for employees to learn about and understand the work of other teams.

Create cross-functional teams to work on specific projects or initiatives. This can bring together diverse perspectives and expertise to drive innovation and find creative solutions to complex problems.

Use collaboration tools such as shared workspaces, video conferencing, and project management software to facilitate communication and collaboration across teams and departments.

By encouraging cross-functional collaboration, organizations can tap into the collective expertise of their workforce and find innovative solutions to complex challenges. This can lead to new and improved products, services, and processes that can drive success and growth for the company.

Celebrate Innovation Successes

If you want to create a culture that values creativity, experimentation, and risk-taking, it's critical that you celebrate innovation successes. This can help motivate employees and inspire them to pursue innovative ideas and solutions. Additionally, recognizing and rewarding innovation successes can help to attract and retain top talent, as employees are drawn to companies that offer opportunities for growth and development.

Here are a few strategies for how you can celebrate innovative ideas at your company:

Recognize and reward innovation : Celebrate and recognize employees who generate and pursue innovative ideas, whether they are successful or not. Rewards can take many forms, such as bonuses, promotions, or public recognition.

: Celebrate and recognize employees who generate and pursue innovative ideas, whether they are successful or not. Rewards can take many forms, such as bonuses, promotions, or public recognition. Share success stories : Share success stories and case studies of innovative projects or initiatives to inspire others and highlight the impact of innovation on the company.

Foster a culture of celebration : Promote a culture of celebration by encouraging employees to share their successes and recognize and celebrate milestones and achievements.

Encourage peer recognition : Encourage peer recognition by creating opportunities for employees to recognize and celebrate the innovative achievements of their colleagues.

: Encourage peer recognition by creating opportunities for employees to recognize and celebrate the innovative achievements of their colleagues. Learn from failures: Celebrate failures as opportunities for learning and growth, and encourage employees to share their failures and lessons learned with the rest of the organization.

Hire With Diversity in Mind

Another best practice is hiring with diversity in mind. Many managers tend to hire individuals who share similar traits and characteristics, often those who resemble themselves.

While this approach may promote a sense of familiarity and comfort among team members, it's not the most effective method for problem-solving. Numerous studies have demonstrated that diverse teams exhibit higher levels of intelligence, creativity, and thorough examination of facts.

By forming a homogenous team, you run the risk of missing out on the best solutions. Instead, strive to create an environment where individuals can expect to have their views challenged by those who differ in appearance, communication style, and thought processes.

Overcoming Barriers to Innovation

Resistance to Change

People are often resistant to change, even when it is for the better. Resistance to change can manifest in many ways, including reluctance to try new things or fear of losing control over established processes.

You can deal with resistance by clearly communicating the need for change and its benefits to the company. This can help employees to understand why the change is necessary and how it will benefit them.

Consider involving your employees in the change process by soliciting their feedback and ideas. This can help to build buy-in and ownership of the change process.

Another idea is to provide training and support to help employees adapt to the change. This can help to reduce anxiety and increase confidence in the new process or system.

Fear of Failure

Fear of failure can be a significant barrier to innovation. Employees may be hesitant to take risks or try new things for fear of being blamed or punished for failure.

You can deal with this barrier to innovation by creating a safe environment where employees feel comfortable taking risks and trying new things without fear of retribution. As we've mentioned earlier, psychological safety is an essential ingredient for dealing with employees' fear of failure. This can be achieved by emphasizing that failure is a natural part of the innovation process and by celebrating failures as opportunities for learning and growth.

Siloed Thinking

Siloed thinking occurs when departments or teams become too focused on their own goals and objectives, leading to a lack of collaboration and communication across the company.

One way of dealing with this issue is to create a culture of transparency by sharing information about the organization's goals, strategies, and initiatives across different departments and teams. This can help to break down barriers and promote collaboration. Also, encourage cross-functional collaboration by creating opportunities for employees from different teams and departments to work together on projects and initiatives. This can help to break down silos and promote cross-functional thinking.

Lack of Resources

Innovation requires resources, whether they be time, funding, or technology. A lack of resources or budget constraints can hinder innovation efforts and limit the ability to pursue new ideas.

Luckily, there are some ways to deal with a lack of resources or budget constraints. For example, you can prioritize innovation as a key business objective and allocate resources accordingly. This may mean reallocating resources from other areas of the business or finding creative ways to generate additional funding for innovation efforts.

Another idea is to look for cost-effective solutions to support innovation efforts, such as open-source software, crowdsourcing, or collaboration with academic institutions. Or, consider leveraging partnerships and collaborations with other organizations, such as vendors or industry associations, to share resources and reduce costs.

Some companies take a lean approach to innovation. This means focusing on high-impact, low-cost solutions that can be implemented quickly and with minimal resources.

If you don't have in-house availability, you can always hire external talent from a talent network community like Adeva. By working with Adeva, you can access a vast pool of highly skilled and experienced tech talent who can bring fresh perspectives and creative solutions to any project. Adeva's rigorous vetting process ensures that you get matched with candidates who possess the technical expertise and the soft skills required to thrive in a culture of innovation.

With Adeva's flexible engagement models, you can scale your teams up or down as needed so that you can adapt quickly to changing market conditions and stay ahead of the competition. Whether it's developing cutting-edge products or optimizing business processes, Adeva's talent can help you create a culture of innovation that drives long-term success.

Conclusion

Creating a culture of innovation is a key driver of success and growth for organizations. By promoting a culture that values creativity, experimentation, and risk-taking, organizations can unlock the full potential of their workforce and drive innovation that can lead to new and improved products, services, and processes.

To create a culture of innovation, companies can focus on several key strategies, including defining and communicating a clear innovation strategy, removing unnecessary bureaucracy, letting information flow freely, encouraging cross-functional collaboration, and celebrating innovation successes.

With the right strategies and tools in place, you can create a culture that values innovation and harnesses the power of its workforce to achieve its goals and objectives.",strategizing new office location
681,8 Strategic Planning Frameworks to Achieve Your Goals,https://www.atlassian.com/work-management/strategic-planning/framework,,"A strategic planning framework is a tool you and your team will use to focus on and fill in a specific element of your strategic plan.

The strategic planning process can be daunting, but a strategic planning framework can help. You’ll use your framework (or frameworks) to tackle a specific piece of the strategic planning process with zero confusion and eyerolls, and plenty of energy and enthusiasm.

But now’s the hard part: How do you transform that idea into an actionable strategy?

You’ve got big ideas and bigger goals for your company. Maybe you’re set on making the world a better place (hey, aren’t we all?). Or maybe you want to be known for unmatched customer care. Regardless of your specific aim, your whole team is gung-ho about your mission.

Alright, maybe not your dog…but you get it.

The good news is that these frameworks are way more straightforward than you think. Anyone from your grandma to your dog will be able to use them.

Here’s the short answer: Anyone who’s completing a strategic plan, whether it’s a strategic plan for a single project or an entire organization.

Strategic planning frameworks help you dig deep into a specific section of your plan, so you can create something comprehensive that actually helps you turn ideas into action.

For example, you could use the objectives and key results (OKRs) framework to iron out the goals included in your strategic plan. Or, you might use the framework called Porter’s five forces (we’ll cover this later) to dig into your competition and understand how competitive factors will impact the future of your organization.

Pulling all of that together can be overwhelming, but a strategic planning framework will help you chip away at that iceberg.

A strategic planning framework is a tool you and your team will use to focus on a specific element of your strategic plan.

The model encompasses all pieces of your strategic plan, but your framework is your approach for a specific piece. Think of your model as the forest, and your different frameworks as the trees. You’ll only use one strategic planning model, but you can use numerous frameworks.

“In our airport example, we might apply a building framework that is designed to maximize the speed at which people move through the airport for efficiency,” Wright adds. “Or alternatively, we might apply a framework which is designed not to maximize speed, but rather to maximize the amount of time people spend in the airport shops.”

In contrast, frameworks help you fill in different elements with specific information.

Tom Wright, CEO and co-founder of Cascade Strategy, a strategy execution platform, likens it to building an airport. “A model of the airport would show you at a high-level how the approach roads connect to the departure hall, and how the departure hall connects to immigration, which then connects to the terminals, the runways, etc.,” he writes in a blog post .

Your strategic planning model provides a high-level overview of all of the elements of your strategic plan. Your model comes first, as it dictates the structure of your entire plan.

Many people use the terms “strategic planning framework” and “strategic planning models” interchangeably. However, the terms represent two parts of a whole.

8 strategic planning frameworks to hash out your strategy with confidence You’ll use different frameworks for different aspects of your strategic plan, from developing your action items to evaluating your competitors. Here are eight of the most common strategic planning frameworks, and which piece of your strategy they can help you with.

1. SWOT analysis Use this framework: To grasp what internal and external factors can impact your strategy SWOT stands for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. Strengths and weaknesses are internal factors (meaning you have some control over them), while opportunities and threats are external factors (and you have little to no control). Get your team together for a brainstorming session where you can tackle each category. Using our customer service example, you might determine: Strengths: We have a new and innovative product that people love.

We have a new and innovative product that people love. Weaknesses: Our customer ticketing system is outdated and ineffective.

Our customer ticketing system is outdated and ineffective. Opportunities: Customers have a growing interest in chat support, which we could roll out relatively easily.

Customers have a growing interest in chat support, which we could roll out relatively easily. Threats: All of our competitors are prioritizing customer service. You’ll use this framework at the beginning of your strategic planning process, as it helps you understand where things are going well for your company — as well as where you need to improve. That’s important information as you hash out your strategy.

2. Issue-based strategic planning Use this framework: To build a strategic plan that addresses your organization’s biggest problems While most of the strategic planning frameworks start with objectives (where you look to the future), this one starts with problems (where you look to the present). You’ll identify the challenges your organization is facing right now and create action plans to address them. This is another framework that you’ll use at the very beginning of the strategic planning process, as it will shape your entire plan. Start by asking: What are the biggest problems our organization is dealing with? Perhaps you’ll realize that your customer feedback scores are plummeting. From there, your strategic plan should detail the steps you’ll take to resolve that issue.

3. Balanced scorecard Use this framework: To define your goals and the steps you’ll take to get there A balanced scorecard (BSC) outlines what your team or organization is trying to accomplish, as well as what work everybody needs to do in order to make it happen. It’s helpful for understanding objectives, connecting and prioritizing day-to-day work, and monitoring progress using established metrics. With this framework, you’ll need to identify: Objectives: The goal you want to achieve (i.e. be looked to as the industry standard for quality customer care)

The goal you want to achieve (i.e. be looked to as the industry standard for quality customer care) Measures: How you’ll define success (i.e. average customer feedback score of B+)

How you’ll define success (i.e. average customer feedback score of B+) Initiatives: Programs established to achieve objectives (i.e. launch a new customer ticketing system to manage your customer support cases)

Programs established to achieve objectives (i.e. launch a new customer ticketing system to manage your customer support cases) Action items: Individual steps one person or a small team will take (i.e. Rico will research ticketing software, Sarah will complete the migration from our current platform, etc.) See how you move from the big, seemingly unattainable goal all the way down to bite-sized actions you can take? That’s the beauty of a balanced scorecard — it connects your organization-wide goals to the daily tasks of everybody on the team.

4. Strategy mapping Use this framework: To understand how all of your company’s objectives fit together A strategy map is often used as a supplement to your balanced scorecard. You’ll list every objective from your balanced scorecard on your strategy map. It should be represented by a shape. Next, you’ll group objectives into different perspectives. Think of these as buckets or themes for similar goals. The most common perspectives are: Financial

Customer

Internal business processes

Learning and growth Once all of your ovals are drawn out, you’ll draw arrows between them to show cause and effect. Does one objective have a direct impact on another? For example, perhaps boosting the expertise of your customer service team (perspective: learning and growth) directly impacts your ability to provide top-notch customer care (perspective: customer). Your strategy map can become a living resource, and you can color-code your objective bubbles (green, yellow, and red) to show your progress toward that objective.

5. Objectives and key results (OKRs) Use this framework: To keep a close eye on progress Objectives and key results (OKRs) is a popular goal setting methodology to help teams go after audacious goals. With this framework, you’ll identify: Objectives: What you want to achieve

What you want to achieve Key results: How you’ll measure your progress Keep in mind that your key results need to be quantitative, measurable outcomes and not tasks or to-dos. So, sticking with our example of world-class customer service, a key result could be, “Secure 25+ five-star reviews by the end of Q2.” OKRs are designed to be ambitious, and you don’t want to overdo it and overwhelm your team. Set only three to five at a time (this template can help) to make sure they’re motivating, and not anxiety-inducing.

6. Porter’s five forces Use this framework: To understand the ins and outs of your existing and prospective competitors Most strategic plans include a section for competitive analysis, and Porter’s five forces is a framework you’ll use to fill in that section. The five competitive forces you’ll identify are: Competition in the industry: Are your competitors growing rapidly?

Are your competitors growing rapidly? Potential of new entrants into the industry: Are a lot of new players able to easily enter your market and thrive? Or is it tough to get going?

Are a lot of new players able to easily enter your market and thrive? Or is it tough to get going? Power of suppliers: How much bargaining power do your suppliers have to pressure you to lower costs?

How much bargaining power do your suppliers have to pressure you to lower costs? Power of customers: How much bargaining power do your customers have to pressure you to lower costs?

How much bargaining power do your customers have to pressure you to lower costs? Threat of substitute products: Is your product easily replaced with another product? Or are you one-of-a-kind? Your competition will shape your strategy, and this framework will help you understand how. If you realize that there’s a high threat of substitute products, then maybe differentiating yourself needs to be a key piece of your strategic plan.

7. Gap planning Use this framework: To determine how you’ll close the gap between where you are and where you want to be You have a strong vision for your organization. Maybe that vision feels like it’s within arm’s reach, or maybe it feels like it’s still miles and miles away. Either way, bridging the gap between where you are now and where you want to be is no easy task. That messy middle is where all of the hard work happens. That’s where gap planning (also called a needs assessment) comes in. It zeros in on everything you need to do to move from your current state to your vision. When you analyze a gap, you need to challenge yourself to think about why you haven’t achieved your ideal state. What’s the root cause? Here’s a very simple example of what this could look like: Vision: Reputation for industry-leading customer service Current state: Good customer service, but not great (average feedback score of B-) Gap: Customer service representatives are using outdated software Improvement: Implement a new ticketing system to support the customer service team This framework is another way to break your vision down into more tactical steps and improvements.",strategizing new office location
614,8-Step Business Relocation Strategy [2024 Relocation Plan],https://agoyu.com/learn/relocation-strategy/,,"If you are a business owner and considering a company move, there are several things to keep in mind. Our friends at ARC Relocation put together the following guest post, to help those of you that are moving more than just your home. For more information on relocating your business or employees, contact them here

You are considering relocating your business. It might be for many reasons; your target market has moved, you’re trying to lower taxes, perhaps it’s an office relocation because your company has outgrown the space you are currently in, and the list goes on.

Relocating your business is time-consuming and stressful. It’s stressful for employees and customers. To help ease the stress of moving, you should develop a relocation plan for your business. When your employees know they are relocating strategically, their stress levels will lower.

Let’s get started creating your business relocation plan!

1. Determine a New Location

The first step in your business relocation strategy should be to determine the place to which you are relocating. You should consider the well-being of your employees, opportunity for growth, relocation expenses, and many other factors when choosing a new location for your business.

Physically visit each potential new location to come up with a pro vs. cons list for each site. Compare the lists against each other and choose the best fit for your company.

After you have determined the new location, it’s time to clear a few things up.

2. List the Reasons Why You Plan to Relocate

Your company’s unique needs will determine your reasons for relocation. When you list the specific reasons for relocating out on paper, it will allow you to focus on the best solutions for your situation. The size of your company and the risk associated with relocation are two reasons to consider.

Possible Reasons Why Your Company Plans to Move

In search of lower taxes

In search of a larger, more diverse workforce

Your company is growing and needs more space

Your lease has expired

A downturn in the economy is forcing you to downsize

Move closer to your target customer

Move for the sake of your employees well being and mental health

Lower cost of operations

Ect.

No matter your reasons for moving, having your reasons neatly listed will aid you in knowing what you need to add to the budget and what you can leave out.

3. Create a Budget

Create a relocation budget, just as you do for everything else in your business. Be as detailed as possible and leave room for unexpected expenses. Consider how hiring a relocation company, such as ARC, can save you time and money.

Creating a budget gives you the freedom to make quick decisions that will benefit your company short term and on into the future.

Does Your Budget Include

Employee relocation costs for each employee

Office furniture moving costs or new office furniture

Relocating equipment or tools (if necessary)

Office computer and telecomm moving costs or new office equipment

Moving company

The new office building (might be in a separate budget)

Miscellaneous expenses

Creating the budget is only a step in the process. You must keep track of your expenses and follow the budget for it to work effectively. The funding can quickly get blown if you fail to manage your time correctly.

4. Create a Timeline

Now that you have a budget, you can create the timeline for the relocation. When will this move take place? How long will each step take? How long will the entire relocation process last? Be as detailed as possible when creating your timeline. Setting milestones to help track where you are currently in the process ensures everyone stays on track. If helpful, create an office relocation checklist to make everything clearer.

Don’t forget to allow for unexpected delays! You might have to adjust the timeline as you encounter a delay.

Share your timeline with your employees, vendors, and customers, so they are not surprised by any delays on your end.

Logistics, Logistics, Logistics

Determine how you will move office supplies and when you will move them. You might be able to go without some supplies and furniture longer than others, so be sure to keep that in mind as you figure out the logistics of everything for the move.

Organizing the entirety of the relocation process is a stressful event, especially when this is your first time going through the process. It might be worth the investment to hand over the process to a company that regularly handles relocation logistics.

5. Ease Your Employees Minds

You can relieve your employees’ stress by answering their questions and being clear on when, why, and how you are moving. They don’t have to know every detail, but making them aware of the general situation will help keep rumors to a minimum and your employees on board with the relocation. You might find out they have strengths that can contribute beneficially towards the move. Under communicating is far more stressful on a team than over-communicating.

If you are moving multiple employees or an individual employee, you need to consider several factors. We created the complete Employee Relocation Guide to help ease your burden!

6. Give Vendors a Heads Up

Now is the time to renegotiate contracts with vendors and let them know you will be changing locations. Vendors such as food and beverage vending, internet, phone, copier, and cleaning services need to be notified reasonably in advance about the company’s plan to relocate.

Having the vendors set up before your company moving into the new space means less downtime as you are settling into your new location. This should be a matter of letting vendors know your relocation timeline.

7. Bring Your Relocation Plan Together

You can now centralize the separate parts of the business relocation strategies you have created in an easy to read shareable format. The best practice is to make it accessible to everyone involved in the relocation. When everyone has the access they need to the relocation plan, it ensures they can be held responsible for their part during the move.

You create less confusion with more precise communication by having the plan in one centralized document. If your employees have any questions about the move, then you can direct them to the document where you should have answered all of their questions.

Whether their questions are about relocation tax implications, logistic questions, vendor questions, timeline questions, or anything else, this document can help to make everything clear.

8. Execute Your Business Relocation Plan

Move week is here! It’s now time to execute your relocation plan. The hard work of organizing is over. You now get to see how well your strategy comes together. Keep in mind everything is not going to go perfectly according to plan.

This period of transition is stressful, so be flexible and offer grace to everyone involved.

Delegation is the Key to a Successful Relocation

Whether you delegate to capable members of your team or a specialized relocation company, your relocation will be more successful working as a team instead of individuals. That is why having a well-communicated plan is critical. Everyone can know their roles and work as a team.

Don’t put the stress of moving your business all on one person’s shoulders; that that includes yourself!

What is a people strategy?

You have strategies for achieving business objectives and an overall HR strategy, but do they intersect? Is there a focus on how your people will succeed at carrying out the company’s goals? At their finest, employees are your greatest asset. However, if they aren’t developing or don’t feel connected to the company, they can hamper its mission.

Find out about the 9 core elements of a future-proof people strategy in this Learning Bite

A people strategy formulates the competencies required to reach goals. It also outlines how to attain, manage, and invest in the employees who will garner the desired outcomes. According to a pioneer in the business strategy industry, Boston Consulting Group (BCG), the three pillars for developing a people strategy are leadership and culture, talent and skills, and HR.

(Image based on the people strategy model by BCG.)

Your people strategy should unite your business and HR strategies. It should determine your organization’s values about the treatment of employees to ensure they feel engaged and motivated to further your goals. HR’s role is to uphold the people strategy by implementing what it takes to create a culture that spurs employees to function at their full potential.

One people strategy example to consider is that of the music streaming service Spotify. Katarina Berg, CHRO, explains that it is “people-first, purpose-driven, and adding business value.”

How people strategy differs from HR strategy

A people strategy definition may seem similar to or even synonymous with an HR strategy, but there is a distinction. While an HR strategy is more of a plan for managing employee logistics, a people strategy refers to an organization’s philosophy about its relationship with employees.

HR strategies include processes for how to recruit, onboard, evaluate, compensate, etc. People strategies outline ways to improve how employees carry out their roles by assessing and nurturing employees’ capabilities, as well as managing the relationship between the employees and the organization. This puts skilled people in the right position to deliver what it takes to achieve the business goals.

Why should you have a people strategy?

Everything a business wants to accomplish requires a plan outlining where you’re heading and how to get there. With a people strategy, you have a clear definition and formula for who you want to be as an employer. Without one, your organization’s culture will be fragmented and may head in an ineffective direction.

Here are some areas where people strategy execution will benefit your company:

Employee empowerment – People are at the center of achieving the organization’s vision. They will thrive when they are set up for success with the tools they need and a favorable environment.

– People are at the center of achieving the organization’s vision. They will thrive when they are set up for success with the tools they need and a favorable environment. Commitment to employees – Documenting your people strategy codifies a pledge to your employees and demonstrates how they benefit.

Elements of a future-proof people strategy

Your people strategy should not only suit your current needs but also withstand both anticipated and unforeseen changes to come.

What the future holds for your workplace is unknown, but executing these concepts within your people strategy can help it remain resilient in the future:

1. Create a strong leadership presence

Effectively managing your organization’s talent is a crucial component in achieving success. If employees don’t work cohesively, you lack the team environment to get the work done and maintain morale. When managers are a source of confidence and inspiration for their teams, it will motivate employees to rise to the level of the company’s expectations.

Having a manager enablement program in place provides practical support to leaders. It gives them the opportunity to mature in leadership competencies they may be lacking. You can develop this type of program specifically for your company or find an outside source that meets your needs. It should offer a broad spectrum of knowledge, such as effective listening and communication and how to build trust and empathy.

2. Focus on employee engagement

Employee engagement should be a key part of your people strategy to offer your workforce connection to the company beyond the scope of their immediate responsibilities. Workers who see themselves as not just a job title but a valued and allied part of an organization will take more pride in the success of the business. In fact, “behaviors of highly engaged business units result in 21% greater profitability.”

This doesn’t mean only going through the motions of regular team get-togethers. It is also about practicing the following principles to connect employees with business outcomes:

Transparency – Keeping all staff informed upfront about changes, challenges, and new ventures will link them to what’s behind the high-level decision making. They will be more apt to back the endeavors and spend less time speculating about what’s going on behind the scenes.

Recognition – Those with exceptional performance or attitude should be acknowledged and rewarded periodically. They will feel appreciated, and others will be incentivized to go above and beyond expectations. An employee recognition program doesn’t have to involve lavish prizes, but it should be meaningful and enjoyable for recipients.

Accountability – Don’t leave it to the strongest performers to pick up the slack for others because they will feel resentful. Managers should be clear about expectations with the less successful employees while offering the necessary support and resources to help them improve.

The goal of your people strategy is to turn your employees into advocates of your brand. (Employee engagement profiles have been defined in a report by Quantum Workplace.)

3. Prioritize learning & development

Enhancing the skills and knowledge of your workforce should be a cornerstone of your company culture. Opportunity for training to improve skills or teach new ones provides your business with capable talent primed for internal mobility.

When employees are equipped with the education and information it takes to perform their job well, they feel empowered, and productivity levels are boosted. A 2020 LinkedIn study on global talent trends (see page 54) showed that more training opportunities would motivate 73% of employees to remain with their current employer.

L&D options should go beyond mandatory training and include a variety of opportunities offered in-house, online, or offsite to coach employees in technical or interpersonal skills. Methods can include peer mentoring, microlearning, or traditional interactive instruction and seminars.

Another way to invest in your staff is to encourage the pursuit of professional development certifications. You can make accredited resources available and subsidize or reimburse the costs, as well as grant time off for studying and taking exams.

4. Supply advancement opportunities

Planning for growth requires deciding not only the number of management positions needed but how to fill them with suitable leaders. A good people strategy supports a strong leadership pipeline that identifies people with the potential to develop leadership skills and creates a leadership development plan together with them.

A visible career path is crucial to retaining employees long-term. When a company offers a tangible learning & development program, employees believe that promotion is attainable and see themselves with a future at your business.

5. Provide an inclusive environment at work

Strong collaboration and input from all team members are tremendously valuable. Everyone should be respected and valued in their workplace, and performance can suffer when employees don’t feel acknowledged or accepted. “Employees who feel their voice is heard are 4.6 times more likely to feel empowered to perform their best work.”

To be certain that everyone feels safe and at ease, your organization must commit to rooting out unconscious bias and promoting an inclusive atmosphere. Align your policies to this and ensure they are widely understood. Take the time to look for ways that routine conduct or dialog may be excluding certain groups of people.

6. Implement employee feedback methods

It’s important to understand the employee experience from their perspectives to obtain fresh ideas that will support your mission. Implement methods for gathering feedback at different employee lifecycle points beyond their annual performance reviews or employee engagement surveys.

Avoid overly broad questions and hone into very specific issues, so responses won’t be overarching and vague. Use formats such as pulse surveys, exit interviews, and promotion interviews to collect feedback. In addition, be sure managers have a way to communicate pertinent observations and insight that come up organically in mentoring sessions or team and one-on-one meetings.

Look for patterns in how employees feel and see themselves within the company. Understand what prompts their loyalty or causes them to move on. Act on your findings by reinforcing what’s paying off and seeking out adjustments for areas that aren’t actively supporting the business goals.

You can combine different methods of gathering employee feedback to get a holistic picture of your employees’ perceptions of your organization. Sapling identified eight effective methods to collect employee feedback.

7. Support the virtual/remote workplace

The post-COVID world will likely see more hybrid and fully remote workforces. That’s why you must factor these alternatives into your future-proof people strategy. Virtual employment itself can present a benefit that both increases productivity and supports employees. For many, this option obliges their desire for flexible hours, work-life balance, and accommodation for certain disabilities. Virtual working can also sustain employee retention by increasing job satisfaction and preventing turnover from relocation situations.

Be sure to contemplate how to translate an inclusive workplace to remote employees. It is just as important for them to be engaged and able to develop their skills. Then, they will see your company as a place to follow their dream career paths.

8. Demonstrate health & wellbeing awareness

Consideration for mental wellbeing has gained momentum since a pandemic-stricken world has faced widespread lockdowns and restrictions. Both physical and mental health contribute to employee performance, so there should be awareness and support for them in the workplace.

Think about how you as a company can combat stigmas and encourage your employees’ overall health, resilience, and mindfulness. Along with providing a wellness program, you can offer ongoing education resources online and means for people to seek expert help during challenging times.

9. Make it undeniable

Your future-proof people strategy should be woven into each employee’s daily experience at work. While it’s important to have it in a formal document that is shared with everyone, no one should need to see it to know it exists. Your workplace should exude an atmosphere that reflects your people strategy better than any words on a page would.

When employees sense they are heard and supported by management, they welcome the relationship their employer is offering. They should be able to read through the words of your people strategy and concur that they are experiencing exactly what it states.

Summing it up

If you want to ramp up employee performance to give your company a competitive edge, you must go beyond your HR strategy. A strong people strategy will build the kind of relationship with your employees that helps them become their best, most productive selves.

The sure-fire way to future-proof your people strategy is to strengthen each of its elements, including leadership, learning & development, and building an inclusive place to work. Investing in employees to build trust and morale will never become outdated. No matter what the coming circumstances may be, your employees will be equipped and inspired to adapt.

285,9 Office Move Tips,https://bevi.co/blog/9-tips-for-an-office-move/,,"Whether you’re moving down the street or across town, an office move can be stressful and frustrating. Here are a few tips to help you avoid the headache and to get your new office space up and running smoothly!

1. Start planning for your move as soon as possible .

Whether you have three months or three years until your move, it’s never too early to start planning. Start making preliminary lists of what needs to be done and a rough timeline for when each task needs to be completed. Organization is key!

It’s also never too early to start organizing materials and even packing boxes if you have the space to store them. If you have supplies you know you won’t need before the move (company merchandise, extra computer parts, you name it), start putting them in boxes and set them aside.

And don’t forget to throw things out. Those Blackberries you’ve been saving since 2007? Dump them (responsibly). Anything you’ve been stockpiling for a rainy day project can be the first to go. Sort through storage closets and get rid of any junk you know won’t be coming with you. Organize filing cabinets and shred anything you don’t need. This is definitely a good time to hop onto that minimalist train.

2. Find the right moving company for you.



There are a number of commercial moving companies dedicated to office relocations so do your research and prioritize what your company needs. Do you need a company that’s flexible with moving times? Some companies move during office hours, but others don’t. Do you want help wrapping cabinets or breaking down desks? Some will help with packing and with large equipment. Is price point your determining factor? Gather detailed pricing information. As time consuming as research can be, you’ll save yourself a headache later by speaking with several companies and choosing the best one for your company’s needs.

3. Schedule your move appropriately

Each company lives by a different schedule, and you know your company’s needs best. If you have the flexibility to schedule your move for a certain time of year, then use it to your advantage. If summer tends to be your slow season, try to time your move for then. Mid-week moving means that your employees will be able to help without giving up their weekends; mid-month moving will likely mean fewer deadlines for projects. If your building allows for moves during office hours, you’ll have your employees’ cooperation, and you might save on fees associated with after-hours moving. That said, the majority of moves will have to take place after business hours and/or over the weekend, so if you have the flexibility to schedule your move down to the day and hour, be sure to take advantage of that.

4. Get your employees involved.

As soon as your office move is finalized, let your employees know. The timing of the move could affect ongoing projects, and your new location could change commute times. Being transparent and giving as much notice as possible will go a long way towards keeping employees happy.

Be sure to engage your employees early on with the moving process. Encourage them to start sorting through their desks weeks or months before the move so there’s no competition for the shredder or the dumpster. If your new office is in a new neighborhood, ask for volunteers to create a neighborhood guide with cheap eats and great happy hour spots. Ask employees for their opinion on office layout (see the tip below!) or for new details they’d like to see in your new space.

5. Create a map of your new office.

If possible, take a walk through your new space and plan your office layout. Print out a blueprint or draw up your own floor plan and mark where furniture will go. Once moving day arrives, you’ll be ready to direct the office movers and fix any spacing issues while you still have manpower.

A move is also a great time to address any issues with your current office layout including workplace culture. Poll your employees to determine what’s working and what isn’t, and come up with a setup for the new office that is both efficient and conducive to a pleasant work experience. You can set goals along with your office move such as becoming more eco-friendly.

6. Prioritize your IT needs.

If you have an onsite IT team, let them know about the move as soon as possible so they can start their planning. If you don’t have an IT team, consider hiring someone to help with the move. An IT professional can help take inventory of your equipment and can help dispose of anything old or outdated that you won’t be taking with you. IT team members will know how to properly pack and label computers, phones, cords – you name it. Set up at the new location will be quicker and easier if the same team works on both the packing and unpacking. If possible, prioritize the IT equipment with your moving company so phone, computer, and internet setup can begin at the new location as soon as possible.

7. Schedule meetings and deadlines appropriately

The few days before and after your move are going to be dedicated to packing, unpacking, and getting settled in your new space. Be sure to warn employees not to schedule in-office meetings with clients too close to the move – in both cases, the office will be in a state of disarray. If you must meet with clients on the days directly before or after an office move, be sure to do so in another location.

Consider warning managers to set deadlines appropriately. Employees will be focused on packing and unpacking their spaces, and depending on your IT team’s schedule, they may be unable to work on their computers surrounding the move. Setting deadlines for major projects with enough time on either end of your move can help employees avoid stress.

8. Label and/or color code boxes and furniture.

Just like with a home move, be sure to label all boxes and materials very clearly. Have employees clearly write their names on several sides of their boxes so they can be stacked together at the new location. If you have your new office layout handy, movers can even deposit employee boxes at the appropriate desk. Desks, file cabinets, and other employee-specific furniture can also be labeled with the employee’s name for easier set up.

For larger companies, assign a different color to each department. Label all boxes and furniture with that color using post it notes, masking tape, or markers. Both you and the movers will easily be able to identify the different departments and will be able to group furniture and boxes in the new office space. You might not have decided where each individual employee will set up shop, but you can at least determine in advance where each department will go on your new floor plan.

9. Update your address.

Changing your address can be one of the more time consuming aspects of a move. Make a list of your different vendors and update any company that sends you materials or bills. Send a postcard to your clients with the updated address. While some of these steps have to wait until after your move, you can proactively order new company stationery and business cards with your new address. You can also set up mail forwarding via USPS in advance.

The hardest part can be updating digital sources. Simply updating your listing with Google My Business won’t be enough – companies like Yelp and Yellow Pages also provide directory information and will need to be updated accordingly. Don’t forget about your own website and social media accounts! Continue to check local business listings in the months following your move to ensure that your business has not been listed twice under the new and old address.

Alright, that’s it for now. Get packing!",plans to move office
700,9 Steps To Building a LinkedIn Content Strategy That ...,https://www.lemlist.com/blog/linkedin-content-strategy,,"Ready to start building or upgrading your brand? Then itâs time to put together a killer LinkedIn content strategy for your business.

We reached our first million in revenue thanks to LinkedIn, a major part of our top-of-the-funnel channel.

And now, weâre going to share the exact steps we followed, so that you can get the same results.

Here are the 9 steps that you should take to start building your LinkedIn content strategy.

1. Set clear goals for your LinkedIn content strategy

First, decide what your main goal is with your LinkedIn strategy, as well as how you will measure it.

In other words, what do you want to achieve, and how will you know that you've achieved it?

For example, you may want to:

âï¸ hire exceptional talent for your team

âï¸ connect with sales prospects

âï¸ build your brand awareness

âï¸ increase your website traffic

Depending on which of these goals you choose, youâll make different posts, connect with different accounts, and track different KPIs.

Basically, if you donât set goals before creating your LinkedIn content strategy, youâll be posting in the dark. Youâll have no way to know if thereâs a return on your investment, or how to tweak your strategy to better meet your needs.

So choose one or two of these goals that most align with your business objectives, then pinpoint metrics that will help you track them.

For example, if a clear objective of yours is to hire exceptional talent, you could track:

â organic reach of LinkedIn job listings

â number of applicants per opening

â offer acceptance rate

â source of hire

Linkedin company pages come with a range of analytics that you can track automatically.

Once youâre sure of what you want to accomplish and how to measure it, youâre ready to start on your greater LinkedIn content strategy.

2. Find & define your LinkedIn target audience

There are more than [950 million people on LinkedIn]. Youâre not going to reach all of them.

Thatâs why it is so important to define your target audience, as well as the individual personas that will be interacting with your posts.

If you havenât already defined your B2B target audience, follow this step-by-step guide to creating your ICPs and buyer personas. Or better yet, learn how to define your target audience even faster using AI.

If youâve already researched your target audience, the next step is to find out who they are on LinkedIn.

One way to do this is to look at the profiles of your current customers, read their descriptions, and check their previous professional experience.

But also check their activity ð

This will help you understand their tone, if they use a lot of emojis or figures of speech, if they post serious updates or memes and jokes, etc.

You'll also be able to get a better understanding of how they interact with people, what kind of content they engage with, and who they respond to in the comments.

All of this is information you can use to tailor your content to be the kind that they start following and reacting to.

For more information on using the LinkedIn platform to find your target audience, use our guide on LinkedIn search.

3. Find your content topic niche

Decide what areas of content you would like to post about. It needs to hit two main criteria:

â content that you or your brand has unique expertise in

â content that your target audience likes to read

For the first criterion, think of topics unique to your brand identity and the problems that your business solves. These are areas where you are the expert.

For example, if you work in the sales industry, you could post about:

â best cold outreach practices

â sales success stories

â multichannel case studies

The second criterion is where the time you spend defining your target audience comes into play. Consider the types of content that your buyer personas interact with, comment on, and share.

For example, if youâre targeting freelancers and solopreneurs, they may like:

â Â storytelling posts that end with a clear takeaway

â carousels, infographics, and other resources they can use to grow their business

â productivity tips

Pinpoint where these two types of content overlap (i.e. your expertise and your target audienceâs interests), and make this your primary topic area.

4. Â Build your LinkedIn profile or company page

If you havenât yet, your next step will be to create your official LinkedIn profile.

Here are some of the most important components to focus on:

Profile photo/page logo

If you already have an official logo for your brand, you should add it at this point.

If youâre creating a personal brand account, choose a professional photo that showcases your personality.

Give it a bright or colorful background to ensure that it stands out on the page. And donât change it often, so that people can immediately associate it with you.

Cover image

When picking your LinkedIn cover image, design it to catch the eye and blend well with your company logo.

Thatâs important because, on the public view of your page, your logo takes up a small portion of the cover image. For example, hereâs what it looks like on our page:

From the cover image and profile photo alone, visitors should get a clear idea of who you are and what you can offer them.

Finally, make sure it matches LinkedInâs official image specifications: 1584 x 396 pixels for a personal profile and 1128 x 191 pixels for a company profile.

For inspiration, try these LinkedIn cover image templates.

Company tagline / header

This part of the profile is a mini sales pitch to your visitors. It should communicate:

â this is who I am/we are

â this is what I/we do

â this is what youâll get from this LinkedIn page

For example, hereâs our tagline:

You can see we went for a tagline that communicates:

â what we do (cold outreach)

â a brand identity (cheeky, playful, informative)

â FOMO (youâre âmissing outâ if you havenât heard of us)

Pick a tagline that fits best with your brand identity and what you want to accomplish with your LinkedIn.

Company bio

Your âAboutâ section should include more in-depth information about what you offer to your followers.

Include keywords and phrases that people might search to find brands like yours, as LinkedIn pages can be indexed by Google and appear in search results.

If you need a little inspiration, hereâs ours:

5. Set up your LinkedIn publication calendar

The key to success on LinkedIn is consistency.

Itâs a bit like working out. If you only put effort into it every other month, you wonât get much in return. But if you put in the work every day, or even just a few times a week, youâll see results.

To help keep you or your social media team consistent, make a plan in advance of what you will post, and when.

The ideal frequency of LinkedIn posts

If you can, work up to one post per weekday to get the most reach and engagement.

But when youâre just getting started, keep it to 1 new post per week as you build your businessâs network. Then increase the frequency as you get more engagement and a larger audience.

Remember, you are building a brand, and this requires persistence.

For example, Briana was building her personal brand as a Creative Marketing Manager. She started posting once every few months, with an organic reach of only 370 views:

And in 2 months of posting multiple times a week, she built an organic reach of thousands per post:

The ideal timing for LinkedIn posts

The perfect time to post on LinkedIn depends on a few factors, like your target audienceâs preferences and behavior patterns.

But as a general rule of thumb, the best time slots are before work, after work, or somewhere around 2 p.m. Test each of these and see which works for your target audience.

If you're posting for an international audience, vary the times of your posts so that different time zones are included.

6. Start writing LinkedIn posts for your business

Everythingâs now ready for you to start posting on LinkedIn.

When you create your first posts, keep these best practices in mind:

Hook the reader with your intro

LinkedIn displays the first couple of lines of your post and leaves the rest in ""see more."" So your goal with your hook is to make it catchy enough to attract your audience.

Just like you want a subject line that corresponds to the body of your emails, you want your intro to be in line with the rest of your post.

Think of the goal of your post: what value are you bringing to people, or what story do you want to tell?

Show that off in the intro. For example:

Here, Guillaume shares right off the bat what his post is about: Google Sheets replacing Excel. But you have to click âsee moreâ to understand exactly why.

Another tip is to make the intro like a preview. So keep the main idea of your post, but don't give away all the information.

With this intro, Tal previews what you should STOP doing, but to find out what you should do, youâll have to keep reading.

Use short phrases

You might have already noticed this, but the LinkedIn platform favors posts with short phrases.

Posts like this are also appealing to readers. A post with one-line sentences or short phrases is easier to read, even if it's the same amount of content.

To formulate this, make every idea a new phrase. You should also simplify your phrases to increase readability.

Check out this LinkedIn post:

He uses simple words and phrases that seem powerful, so youâre able to skim through the post easily. And at the end, you arrive at a call-to-action that is building his brand and his business.

If you need help thinking of things to post about, you can use a tool like Taplio to get AI-generated LinkedIn post inspiration.

Increase your reach by tagging relevant people & pages

Once your post is ready, there are a few more things you can do that will encourage engagement.

The first of these is tagging all relevant parties. The more people you tag, the more visibility your posts will get, and of course, the more likely these people will be to comment on your post.

See how Guillaume managed this in an earlier post that drove hype to lemlist:

lemlist was a younger company at this time, and getting attention from big names helped boost our awareness.

If someone said something that inspired you to write the post, tag them. If you are writing a post about your experience with a company, tag them.

Especially for small or emerging companies, this can be a great way to get a boost from established brands and their followers.

Add images and videos to your LinkedIn posts

The LinkedIn algorithm favors adding pictures and videos to your posts. So one of the best ways to get more engagement is to use them!

In general, posts with images, videos, and other media get better results, because they are eye-catching to your followers.

See how Lucas did this by sharing useful information in the LinkedIn carousel format:

On LinkedIn, you can share:

â plain text posts

â photos

â videos (native performs better than links)

â documents (PDFs, carousels, etc.)

â articles

â LinkedIn polls

Use a variety of these formats to test which types of visuals, text, videos, or other great content on LinkedIn resonate with your target audience.

Include hashtags

Thankfully we are well past the days of filling social media posts with endless hashtags that nobody understands.

Still, adding a few hashtags to posts is still a relevant practice, especially for businesses.

This is because hashtags allow you to essentially label a post under a certain category, which can help boost its ability to pop up on the top of searches.

Add 1-3 targeted hashtags to appear on the feeds of people who are following the topics that are relevant to your brand.

7. Interact with other LinkedIn accounts

Take a few minutes a day to comment on and engage with relevant posts on your businessâs LinkedIn feed.

Hereâs how:

Step 1 - Search for things that matter to your content niche

For example, your content niche is B2B sales. Follow all the people and brands who are leaders in this space, and connect with other accounts who share this topic - your competitors included.

See what they're up to.

Step 2 - Check out their posts & read their articles

Get a feel for what your network posts about, and what you or your brand can add to the conversation.

Step 3 - Leave thoughtful comments

Leave real comments on the content that people and businesses in your network are posting. Aim to add value and insights where you can.

For industry leaders and popular accounts, try to leave your comments as soon as you can on their posts. You can sort your feed by most recent posts to ensure youâre the first to the table.

This gives you the best chance of grabbing the attention of the postâs author and their audience.

The more you interact with other accounts in your topic areas, the more likely they are to interact with you and boost your engagement in return.

8. Promote your LinkedIn content

Simply posting new content and interacting with other accounts isn't enough.

To get your LinkedIn content seen by as many people as possible, youâll need to promote it.

Here are a few LinkedIn promotion techniques to get you started:

Leverage your team

Engagement from your colleagues and team members is a key factor in increasing the reach of your brandâs LinkedIn posts.

Thatâs because, in LinkedInâs algorithm, your post is shown to your team membersâ network after they like and comment on it.

So for every person in your network who gives your many posts a like, youâre multiplying your reach by their follower count.

At lemlist we frequently share our social media posts with each other to encourage engagement. Itâs an automatic distribution system built into our company culture, and it works!

Every LinkedIn profile within your team is an opportunity for brand awareness and business growth.

Leverage your network

You can reach out to people outside of your company to promote your content as well.

Never be afraid to use the power of your network. After all, they connect with you because they are interested in what you are doing.

You can simply connect with people who might be interested and ask them to check out your content or share it with others in their network.

And if youâve ever responded to someone in your LinkedIn DMs asking you to promote their work, now is the time to ask them to return the favor!

Leverage LinkedIn groups

LinkedIn groups are a perfect opportunity to connect with people in your target audience or your ICP.

Why? Because you can easily find an entire group of people that you know will be interested in connecting with you based on specific attributes.

Once you do that, you can share relevant content that the group would appreciate.

For example, in a cold calling training group, we might share one of lemlist's cold calling webinars, or share a post we made with some cold calling tips.

This boosts your reach and also provides value to your target audience.

Leverage other social media channels

As long as your profile is public, you can share your LinkedIn posts on other social media sites.

Sharing your LinkedIn posts across other channels introduces a new audience to your content. They get a link to your LinkedIn profile, which can help build your network and follower count.

Simply copy the URL of the post and share it with individuals or groups in your target audience.

Send direct messages to people in your target audience

To make the most personal connections with your target audience, send them messages directly.

One option is to do this manually, by choosing profiles one by one and typing out personalized messages. It will get the job done, but youâll spend hours targeting the right people and personalizing each message.

Instead, we recommend combining LinkedIn searches with lemlist's automated messages to personalize at scale with your target audience. You can even get an AI-generated sequence thatâs ready to connect with hundreds of LinkedIn prospects in seconds.

You can try it for free.

This works best when you have content that is targeted towards a certain group.

For example, at lemlist weâve worked on more content for multichannel sequence users. When it was ready, our sales team used lemlist campaigns to share the content with people in our target audience.

Send LinkedIn voice messages with lemlist

Written messages, like emails and chat messages, are fine, but what if you could also send your leads audio messages?

Well, you can send LinkedIn voice notes straight from within lemlist.

These voice messages integrate perfectly into any multichannel lemlist campaign.

When you use more channels and mediums in your outreach, your engagement will skyrocket!

Make sponsored posts

If you really want to invest in the reach of your post, you can do a LinkedIn-sponsored post. Itâs essentially just an ad.

It costs money and doesnât always guarantee a high ROI, so if you are a small company, we only recommend using it as a last resort.

Now, that isn't to say sponsoring a post is a bad thing. In fact, it can really boost your reach.

But if you can get similar benefits for free, you should try that first.

9. Edit your LinkedIn content strategy according to your results

The strategy you implement when you first start posting on LinkedIn will evolve with time as you find out what works and what doesnât.

In fact, a strategy that changes periodically is proof that youâre evolving as a brand and learning from your actions.

Go back to the metrics you defined in step 1 of this process and keep track of how they grow, and what actions drove the change.

This way, you can pinpoint the content types, messages, and topic areas that most contribute to your goals.

Hereâs an extra process we recommend to measure the impact of your LinkedIn activity on your website traffic and conversions:

â Open this tool and UTM the website link youâre sharing in a DM, post, or comment.

â If youâre not sure how UTMs work, refer to this post from Google.â

â Go to Google Analytics â Acquisition â Campaigns to analyze traffic from LinkedIn.

â Set events and goals in Google Analytics to measure metrics beyond traffic (e.g. conversions, free trials, form submissions, etc.).

The key takeaways

Here are the key steps you should take for a killer LinkedIn content strategy:

â Set clear goals and metrics to measure success.

â Define your target audience and tailor your content to their interests.

â Choose a niche that aligns with your expertise and your audience's interests.

â Optimize your LinkedIn profile or company page with a professional photo/logo, compelling tagline, and informative bio.

â Establish a consistent posting schedule and vary your content formats.

â Engage with other LinkedIn accounts by commenting and interacting with their posts.

â Promote your content through your team, network, LinkedIn groups, and other social media channels.

â Evaluate your results and adjust your strategy based on metrics and feedback.

â Track website traffic and conversions using UTM parameters in Google Analytics.

Remember, consistency, engagement, and value-driven content are key to a successful LinkedIn content strategy.

674,A European strategy for data | Shaping Europe's digital future,https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/strategy-data,,"Data is an essential resource for economic growth, competitiveness, innovation, job creation and societal progress in general. In the future, the development of data-driven applications will bring various benefits to both citizens and businesses:

improve healthcare

create safer and cleaner transport systems

generate new products and services

reduce the costs of public services

improve sustainability and energy efficiency

The European strategy for data aims at creating a single market for data that will ensure Europe’s global competitiveness and data sovereignty. This will lead to the creation of Common European Data Spaces. They will ensure that more data becomes available for use in the economy and society, while keeping the companies and individuals who generate the data in control.

To further ensure the EU’s leadership in the global data economy the European strategy for data intends to:

adopt legislative measures on data governance, access and reuse. For example, for business-to-government data sharing for the public interest;

make data more widely available by opening up high-value publicly held datasets across the EU and allowing their reuse for free;

invest €2 billion in a European High Impact Project to develop data processing infrastructures, data sharing tools, architectures and governance mechanisms for thriving data sharing and to federate energy-efficient and trustworthy cloud infrastructures and related services;

enable access to secure, fair and competitive cloud services by facilitating the set-up of a procurement marketplace for data processing services and creating clarity about the applicable regulatory framework on cloud framework of rules on cloud.

In 2020, the Commission has published a report on Business-to-Government (B2G) data sharing. Originating from a high-level Expert Group, the report presents a series of policy, legal, and funding recommendations aimed at facilitating the scaling, responsible, and sustainable implementation of B2G data sharing in the public interest within the EU.

Two critical pieces of legislation have been put in place to protect the rights and interests of citizens while simultaneously fostering industrial and technological development. They play a vital role in laying the foundation for achieving the objectives outlined in the European data strategy:

The Data Governance Act (DGA) is a comprehensive tool designed to oversee the reuse of publicly or protected data across various sectors. It aims to facilitate data sharing by regulating new entities known as data intermediaries and promoting data sharing for altruistic reasons. The DGA covers both personal and non-personal data, with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) applying whenever personal data is involved. The inclusion of built-in safeguards, in addition to GDPR, is intended to enhance trust in the sharing and reuse of data. This trust-building is crucial for increasing the availability of data in the market.

The Data Act entered into force on 11 January 2024. It is a pillar of the European strategy for data. Its main objective is to make Europe a leader in the data economy by harnessing the potential of the ever-increasing amount of industrial data, in order to benefit the European economy and society.

You can read about the European data strategy, including the Q&A. and the Fact Sheet.

Open consultation

The open public consultation on the European strategy for data ran from 19 February to 31 May 2020. The summary report takes stock of the contributions and presents preliminary trends that emerge from them, focusing on quantitative aspects.

The Commission also ran an open public consultation on the Data Act, a key part of the strategy for data. The summary report provides an overview of the contributions.

Similarly, the Commission launched a 2019 SME panel consultation on B2B data sharing following the publication of the Guidance for the Private sector data sharing.

Background

The 2018 Communication ‘Towards a common European data space was a comprehensive approach to data reusability across sectors. It covered open data from the public sector, scientific research data, and business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-government (B2G) data sharing. The outcome of the 2017 Stakeholder dialogue on building a European data economy fed into the 2018 communication.",strategizing new office location
335,A Look Inside Hutch Games' London Office Expansion,https://www.officelovin.com/2020/04/a-look-inside-hutch-games-london-office-expansion/,,"A team of designers from workplace design firm AIS Workplace recently designed a new office expansion for game development company Hutch Games in London, England.

“The design concept for the space was industrial but make it fun! Pops of colours and graphics that AIS have developed in conjunction with the Hutch team have been applied throughout the space to create the unique Hutch style that the staff have really come to love.

Keen to create a space that would not only be a working office, but give staff a space to relax in, collaborate and ultimately inspire. With this in mind, along with break out areas and open plan kitchen space, we specifically created a well-being room to give staff a private space that isn’t a meeting room.

Working within the former warehouse building had its’ challenges, mostly in making the space acoustically sound with its’ exposed brickwork and vaulted wood beam ceilings. Suspended acoustic screens were key in solving these issues, while at the same time help to divide the space and create intimate pockets of workspace for smaller team collaboration. The screens lower reverberation and background chatter in the space and were laser cut, making them bespoke with the Hutch logo. Each floor features a different custom made Hutch sign, further embedding the unique personality of the business. As the Hutch business continues to grow strength to strength we remain their trusted workplace design and build partner, now assisting them as they expand into Canada opening their first overseas office in Nova Scotia,” says AIS Workplace.",future office expansion plans
346,A Place to Grow: Growth plan for the Greater Golden ...,http://www.ontario.ca/document/place-grow-growth-plan-greater-golden-horseshoe,,"The Greater Golden Horseshoe ( GGH ) is one of the most dynamic and fast-growing regions in North America. It is the destination of choice for many people and businesses relocating from other parts of Canada and around the world. They settle here because of the high quality of life and the economic opportunities. This is a place of prosperity where, through their skills and talents, people are building a greater future for themselves.

The GGH has one of the world’s most vibrant and diverse economies – generating upwards of 25 per cent of Canada’s Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) footnote 1[1] , it is the economic engine of Ontario. While the GGH ’s competitive advantage has historically been its location in the heart of the Great Lakes region with close proximity to major United States markets, today the region is widely recognized for its highly-educated workforce and uniquely multicultural population, whose social and economic diversity are critical factors for success in a knowledge-based economy.

The GGH contains many of Ontario’s most significant ecological and hydrologic natural environments and scenic landscapes, including the Oak Ridges Moraine, the Niagara Escarpment and the other natural areas in the Greenbelt Area and beyond. These natural areas support biodiversity, provide drinking water for the region’s inhabitants, sustain its many resource-based industries, support recreational activities that benefit public health and overall quality of life, and help moderate the impacts of a changing climate .

The region also has some of Canada’s most important and productive farmland. Its fertile soil, moderate climate, abundant water resources, and proximity to markets support agricultural production that cannot be duplicated elsewhere in the country.

The First Nations and Métis communities within the Great Lakes region have a unique relationship with the land and its resources, which continues to shape the history and economy of the area today. Ontario, including the area covered by the A Place to Grow: The Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, is largely covered by a number of Treaties that provide for treaty rights. In addition, Aboriginal communities may have Aboriginal rights within the Plan area. Ontario recognizes the unique role that Indigenous peoples have had and will continue to have in the growth and development of this region.

As the GGH grows and changes, we must continue to value what makes this region unique to ensure the sustained prosperity of Ontario, its people, and future generations. While growth is an important part of vibrant, diversified urban and rural communities and economies, the magnitude of growth that is expected over the coming decades for the GGH presents several challenges:

To address these challenges and ensure the protection and effective use of finite resources, A Place to Grow Plan, together with the Greenbelt Plan, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, and the Niagara Escarpment Plan, builds on the Provincial Policy Statement ( PPS ) to establish a unique land use planning framework for the GGH that supports the achievement of complete communities , a thriving economy, a clean and healthy environment, and social equity.

In implementing these provincial plans, the Province recognizes the importance of consulting with First Nations and Métis communities on planning matters that may affect their rights and interests. Provincial plans must be implemented in a manner that is consistent with the recognition and affirmation of existing Aboriginal and treaty rights under section 35 of the Constitution Act, 1982.

1.2 A Place to Grow: Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe

A Place to Grow is the Ontario government’s initiative to plan for growth and development in a way that supports economic prosperity, protects the environment, and helps communities achieve a high quality of life. The Places to Grow Act, 2005 enables the development of regional growth plans that guide government investments and land use planning policies.

The Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, 2006 (Growth Plan, 2006) was the first growth plan to provide a framework for implementing Ontario’s vision for building stronger, prosperous communities by better managing growth in this region. It established the long-term framework for where and how the region will grow, while recognizing the realities facing our cities and smaller communities and acknowledging what governments can and cannot influence. It also demonstrated leadership for improving the ways in which our cities, suburbs, towns, and villages will grow over the long-term.

Vision for the GGH More than anything, the Greater Golden Horseshoe ( GGH ) will continue to be a great place to live, work and play. Its communities will be supported by a strong economy and an approach that puts people first. This approach protects the Greenbelt and will ensure a cleaner environment is passed on to future generations. A Place to Grow will support the achievement of complete communities with access to transit networks, protected employment zones and an increase in the amount and variety of housing available. The GGH will have sufficient housing supply that reflects market demand and what is needed in local communities. Thriving, livable, vibrant, and productive urban and rural areas will foster community health and individual well-being. The region will be supported by modern, well-maintained, sustainable, and resilient infrastructure built in accordance with a broad plan for managing growth. Residents will have easy access to food, shelter, education, health care, arts and recreation, and information technology. Public services will be co-located in community hubs that are broadly accessible. Getting around will be easy. An integrated transportation network will allow people choices for easy travel both within and between urban centres throughout the region. Public transit will be fast, convenient, and affordable. Automobiles will be only one of a variety of effective and well-used choices for transportation. Transit and active transportation will be practical elements of our urban transportation systems . A healthy natural environment with clean air, land, and water will characterize the GGH . The Greenbelt, including significant natural features, such as the Oak Ridges Moraine and the Niagara Escarpment, will continue to be enhanced and protected in perpetuity. The GGH 's rivers and streams, forests and natural areas will be accessible for residents to enjoy their beauty. Our cultural heritage resources and open spaces in our cities, towns, and countryside will provide people with a sense of place. Natural areas and agricultural lands will provide a significant contribution to the region’s resilience and our ability to adapt to a changing climate. Unique and high quality agricultural lands will be protected for the provision of healthy, local food for future generations. Farming will be productive, diverse, and sustainable. Urban centres will be vibrant and characterized by more compact development patterns that support climate change mitigation and adaptation, and provide a diversity of opportunities for living, working, and enjoying culture. The evolving regional economy of the GGH will continue to mature into an economic powerhouse of global significance. It will function as Canada’s principal international gateway. The Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area ( GTHA ) will be a thriving metropolis with an extraordinary waterfront. The urban areas of the region, including Toronto, will be celebrated centres of influence for commerce, culture, and innovation. All of this will translate into a place where residents enjoy a high standard of living and an exceptional quality of life.

The implementation of A Place to Grow is supported by Metrolinx (an agency of the Government of Ontario created to improve coordination and integration of all modes of transportation in the GTHA ) and The Big Move (the GTHA ’s first regional transportation plan). The Province has made significant investments in transit projects in the GTHA and beyond, and continues to invest in rapid transit projects to support the regional transit network.

Since the introduction of the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe in 2006, the region has seen a shift to more compact development patterns, a greater variety of housing options, more mixed-use development in urban growth centres and other strategic growth areas , and greater integration of transit and land use planning.

Despite these early successes, there is still more work to do. Now is the time to build on the progress that has been made towards the achievement of complete communities that are compact, transit-supportive , and make effective use of investments in infrastructure and public service facilities . At the same time, A Place to Grow will continue to ensure protection of our agricultural and natural areas and support climate change mitigation and adaptation as Ontario moves towards the goal of environmentally sustainable communities.

A Place to Grow (“this Plan”), builds upon the success of the initial Growth Plan, 2006 and responds to the key challenges that the region continues to face over the coming decades with enhanced policy directions.

1.2.1 Guiding principles

The successful realization of this vision for the GGH centres on effective collaboration amongst the Province, other levels of government, First Nations and Métis communities, residents, private and non-profit sectors across all industries, and other stakeholders. The policies of this Plan regarding how land is developed, resources are managed and protected, and public dollars are invested are based on the following principles:

Support the achievement of complete communities that are designed to support healthy and active living and meet people’s needs for daily living throughout an entire lifetime.

Integrate climate change considerations into planning and managing growth such as planning for more resilient communities and infrastructure – that are adaptive to the impacts of a changing climate – and moving towards environmentally sustainable communities by incorporating approaches to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

1.2.2 Legislative authority

This Plan is issued under the authority of section 7 of the Places to Grow Act, 2005 . It was approved through an Order in Council under that Act to come into effect on May 16, 2019. It was most recently amended through an Order in Council under that Act that came into effect on August 28, 2020. This Plan replaces the Growth Plan for the Greater Golden Horseshoe, 2017 that took effect on July 1, 2017.

This Plan applies to the area designated by Ontario Regulation 416/05 as the Greater Golden Horseshoe growth plan area. All decisions in respect of the exercise of any authority that affects a planning matter will conform with this Plan, subject to any legislative or regulatory provisions providing otherwise.

1.2.3 How to read this Plan

This Plan informs decision-making regarding growth management and environmental protection in the GGH . It consists of policies, schedules, definitions, and appendices. It also includes non-policy contextual commentary to provide background and describe the purpose of the policies.

Relationship with the Provincial Policy Statement ( PPS )

The PPS provides overall policy directions on matters of provincial interest related to land use and development in Ontario, and applies to the GGH , except where this Plan or another provincial plan provides otherwise.

Like other provincial plans, this Plan builds upon the policy foundation provided by the PPS and provides additional and more specific land use planning policies to address issues facing specific geographic areas in Ontario. This Plan is to be read in conjunction with the PPS . The policies of this Plan take precedence over the policies of the PPS to the extent of any conflict, except where the relevant legislation provides otherwise. Where the policies of this Plan address the same, similar, related, or overlapping matters as policies in the PPS, applying the more specific policies of this Plan satisfies the requirements of the more general policies in the PPS. In contrast, where matters addressed in the PPS do not overlap with policies in this Plan, those PPS policies must be independently satisfied.

As provided for in the Places to Grow Act, 2005 , this Plan prevails where there is a conflict between this Plan and the PPS . The only exception is where the conflict is between policies relating to the natural environment or human health. In that case, the direction that provides more protection to the natural environment or human health prevails.

Relationship with other Provincial Plans

This Plan must also be read in conjunction with other provincial plans as defined in the Planning Act that may apply within the same geography. Within the GGH , this includes the Greenbelt Plan, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, and the Niagara Escarpment Plan. Other provincial plans, including the Parkway Belt West Plan and Central Pickering Development Plan under the Ontario Planning and Development Act, 1994, the Lake Simcoe Protection Plan under the Lake Simcoe Protection Act, 2008 and some source protection plans under the Clean Water Act, 2006, also apply within the GGH . Each of these plans applies to certain defined parts of the GGH and provides specific policy on certain matters.

Within the Greenbelt Area , policies of this Plan that address the same, similar, related, or overlapping matters as the Greenbelt Plan, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, or the Niagara Escarpment Plan do not apply within that part of the Greenbelt Area covered by the relevant plan except where the policies of this Plan, the Greenbelt Plan, the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Plan, or the Niagara Escarpment Plan provide otherwise.

As provided in the Places to Grow Act, 2005 , where there is a conflict between the Greenbelt, Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation, or Niagara Escarpment Plans and this Plan regarding the natural environment or human health, the direction that provides more protection to the natural environment or human health prevails. Detailed conflict provisions are set out in the Places to Grow Act, 2005.

Horizon of this Plan

While the PPS , 2020 provides for a time horizon of up to 25 years for making sufficient land available to meet projected needs, policy 1.1.2 of the PPS , 2020 provides that a provincial plan may provide an alternate time horizon for specific areas of the province. Within the GGH , this Plan provides that the applicable time horizon for land use planning is 2051. While certain policies have specific target dates, the goals and policies of this Plan are intended to be achieved within the horizon of this Plan.

Nothing in this Plan limits the planning for infrastructure and public service facilities beyond the horizon of this Plan. However, planning for infrastructure will not predetermine the form, pattern, or extent of settlement area boundary expansions. Planning authorities may also plan for the long-term protection of employment areas provided lands are not designated beyond the horizon of this Plan.

Read the entire Plan

This Plan is to be read in its entirety and the relevant policies are to be applied to each situation. The language of each policy, including the policies in Section 5, will assist decision-makers in understanding how the policies are to be implemented.

While some policies refer to other policies for ease of use, these cross-references do not take away from the need to read the Plan as a whole. There is no implied priority in the order in which the policies appear.

Consider specific policy language

Each policy provides direction on how it is to be implemented, how it is situated within this Plan, and how it relates to other policies. The choice of language in the policies is intended to distinguish between the types of policies and the nature of implementation. For example, ""will"" and “shall” are used interchangeably for policies that indicate positive directives in the same way that just ""shall"" is generally used in other provincial plans. Similarly, expressions like “is not” and “will not be” are used for policies that set out limitations and prohibitions in the same way as ""shall not"" is generally used in other plans.

Policies represent minimum standards

The policies of this Plan represent minimum standards. Within the framework of the provincial policy-led planning system, decision-makers are encouraged to go beyond these minimum standards to address matters of importance, unless doing so would conflict with any policy of this Plan.

Defined terms and meanings

Italicized terms in this Plan are defined in Section 7. For non-italicized terms, the normal meaning of the word applies. Defined terms are intended to capture both singular and plural forms of these terms in the policies.

Supplementary direction

Supplementary Direction may be issued by the Minister or by other ministers of the Crown, where appropriate, in accordance with the policies of this Plan to provide technical information and criteria to facilitate the implementation of this Plan.

Guidance material

Guidance material may be issued to assist decision-makers with implementing the policies of this Plan. Information, technical criteria, and approaches outlined in guidance material are meant to support, but not add to or detract from, the policies of this Plan.",future office expansion plans
102,A Quick How-to Guide To Office Space Planning & Furnishing,https://directoffice.com.au/blogs/a-quick-how-to-guide-to-planning-office-space-and-furnishing/,,"The concept of office layout design may vary according to people, based on the office styles they conceptualise. However, everyone agrees that the furniture layout plays a significant role in an office design’s success or failure, perhaps more than any other factor. Creating a good office space where productivity thrives is more like a company’s mirror-image and how it operates. So how can one describe what a workspace is? Simply put— workspaces can be defined as any multifunctional space and multimodel area where people, processes, and technologies collaborate. Unlike traditional workspaces that included rows of desk-and-chair sets, simply putting the furniture together is not enough to create a right working environment. There are various factors to consider when organising office furniture and spacing, such as the workspace’s physical dimensions, reorganisation or relocation of the furniture, and individual personalisation of the workspace, among many others.

Here are some questions to consider when planning for Office Furniture Spacing:

Does the workspace accommodate acoustical privacy? (for example- can people talk in private, according to the required confidentiality level? or do noises and conversations interfere with individual work?)

Does the workspace offer visual privacy?

Can an employee personalise his or her workspace?

Is natural light accessible, or is there access to artificial lighting only?

Is the workspace arranged to facilitate personal contact?

Does the workspace have space for storage or equipment when employees need immediate access to physical documents?

Does the furniture in the office have enough room for a barrier-free turning radius?

Based on this, the success of work productivity also parallels organisational culture, which is influenced- to some extent by the furnishing. While planning for office furniture and spacing, you should consider two major aspects: the cost and how the design will impact your team.

What’s the ideal space requirement?

There is no clear-cut answer for a question this simple because the answer has to deal with so many different aspects. Some major facets to consider are as follows:

Nature of the work: If you spend most of your workday out on field assignments, meetings or site visits, a relatively smaller office space can be adequate for you. However, for office employees who work at an office workstation for most of the day, a small space may create discomfort. The Corporate Climate: The perception of designated personal office space is a matter of comparison; it is a generally accepted fact that those at higher positions may have larger offices. Thus, individual spaces can seem large or small compared to what our peers have in the same office space. Individual Perception: While it may seem simple, the amount of space available can have a profound psychological meaning for an individual staff member. After all, it is natural to strive for “more” space as this can be linked with having more importance or authority in the office. Often, employees associate individual workspace with their status within the organisation. The Anthropometry: Finally, how much space is required may also depend on the employee’s size and shape. Beyond everything, the office accommodates them, enables them to safely move and work unhindered, and allow them to finish their jobs.

Furthermore, here are some more aspects to consider: Reach – make sure that employees can place equipment and work materials according to importance and frequency of use.

The sequence of use – how the items are used within the workspace.

Movement within the area – consider both the occupant and the chair.

consider both the occupant and the chair. Communication needs

Access for maintenance

Other furniture requirements, such as visitor’s chair or stool, and filing cabinets.

Need for privacy (for example, verbal/auditory privacy, visual privacy)

How often, and How long, an employee will be at their desk (example, Do they have other job functions that are done in the field)

How Do I Plan for Office Furniture and Spacing?

Having a clear set of plans and goals make the task of arranging an office space seem manageable and less overwhelming. It helps us to clearly see what we are looking for and how to go about implementing it. Here are some steps to consider while planning for office furniture and spacing: 1. Have a Comprehensive Goal Before starting the project, have clear and specific objectives for the office design you want to produce. Ask yourself, “How can I make it successful?” Also, take the company goals into account, and plan for the years ahead. Will they have an impact on the office redesign?

2.Create a Blank Floorplan to Scale

After setting your goal, you can then plan for the area created to scale. You can measure the area carefully and draw a scale plan yourself as well. Identify all the doors, windows, power and data points, and anything else that needs to be accessed, like light switches, air-conditioning or fire alarms and fire- extinguishers.

3. Recognise your Requirements The next step while planning for office space is to note the size and build of the different teams that the office will accommodate. Consider the question- “who works with who, or who needs to communicate regularly with who?” Identify the requirements of the workstation. Think about how much space each employee actually needs and how much personal storage is required. Additionally, identify other shared facilities, like central storage, meeting facilities, printers, or copiers.

4. Start Space Planning After the above-mentioned data is collected, you can then start sketching out the main walkways of the office that will need to be kept clear. It is advised to maintain a walkway that is at least 750mm clear, including pinch points. However, to take things further, you can consider wheelchair accessibility and provide a minimum width of 900mm. You also need to bear in mind the fire escape passages. The next move is to roughly sketch out where the different departments of people should be positioned. While doing so, you should consider things like good communication and positioning of shared facilities. Having a good layout can help avoid needless wasting of time. Most importantly, you should undertake a fire risk assessment for any office.

5. Space Planning the Furniture

If the office space is designed with banks of workstations with people sitting back to back, then the recommended gap between desks is a minimum of 2000mm, and if possible, as much as 2200 or 2400mm. Of Course, it may vary according to the size of chairs and the nature of the work being performed, as well as the number of workstations in each bank. It is also important to consider access to power outlets when positioning workstations and office machines. Likewise, don’t forget the informal meeting space within the office!

6.Designing the Look and Feel of the Place Another important question you should consider while planning for office furniture and spacing is- “what look and feel do I want for the office?” This doubtlessly often depends on the company culture. The furnishing and spacing also evolve the company culture as time passes. For example, some companies use their corporate colour through the office. This needs to be done with care as the effects may differ from those you are trying to implement. In recent years, the trend of introducing a more residential, softer feel to an office is growing. This has led to the adoption of softer colour pallets and wood furnishing, rather than bold primary hues.

Open Office Furniture and Layout Concepts

Functional office space designs take different work modes into consideration. This includes flexible spaces that cater to each type of work. For the most part, most office employees do not do the same task throughout the working hour. Thus, it does not always make sense to have them stay in similarly designed spaces all day. For this, different space designs are needed. Here are some core types of space designs to consider while planning for office furniture and spacing:

1. Focus Cornerstone

This type of office space is based on fostering concentration. This is a critical space in any office. Workstations in quiet areas and beautiful benching in a serene environment can contribute to a healthy focus cornerstone in an office. 2. Teamwork Areas It is important in an office to have space where people can easily duck into for collaboration. This space is specifically designed for meetings, where peers can have conversations or brainstorm with colleagues. This type of office space is based on fostering concentration. This is a critical space in any office. Workstations in quiet areas and beautiful benching in a serene environment can contribute to a healthy focus cornerstone in an office.

3. Teamwork Areas

It is important in an office to have space where people can easily duck into for collaboration. This space is specifically designed for meetings, where peers can have conversations or brainstorm with colleagues.

4. Social Spaces Offices need cafeterias and other multi-use gathering spaces where coworkers can bump into each other for a quick conversation. This can lead to further collaboration and even helps uplift the office environment. 5. Training Spaces While most organisations do not need a dedicated training hall, having a training space with flexible furnishing and layout for conferences can help employees. You can convert these types of spaces into auditorium-style seating for even clients while training groups.

6. Interlude

This office space is described as any area where employees recharge and go back to work refreshed. This could be an outdoor terrace, a peaceful meditation room or any other space not explicitly used for working.

Ideas for Open Office Furniture

The right furnishing is crucial in any space. In the case of an open office design, however, the right furnishing can mean the difference between an open concept workspace people thrive in and one they grumble about. Here are five ideas for open office furniture to use in open offices:

1. Furniture that allows Perches and Ledges

In an open office, having furnishings that facilitate perches and ledges can uplift the work environment. Co-workers can drop in and chat in spaces that have ledges or seating that enable perching. Such furniture is perfect for little-used areas, like gaps under the stairs or adjacent to conference rooms. While informal perching spots aren’t a distinct space type on their own, they can still be useful and are popular in the office when they are in the right place.

2. Office Pod/Booths (Comfort Booth) Adding an office pod into the open office is one of the best ways to introduce privacy into the workspace. This innovative piece of furniture allows for uninterrupted conversations, private phone calls, and the completion of urgent assignments without distractions. Individual work pods can also be incorporated into any space without financial limitations of construction work. 3. Adjustable Desks with Health Benefits Something as simple as an adjustable desk can offer a progressive change in the work environment. Prolonged sitting can lead to increased rates of heart conditions and joint pain, along with other health risks. Given that many office employees are required to sit for seven to eight-hour shifts every day, adjustable office desks can make a healthy difference in workers’ productivity and well-being.

4. Aero Acoustic Partition A versatile product, aero acoustic Partitions in the workplace can lead to many benefits. The partition can be customised to feature multiple designs, including a company logo. From simple patterns and colourful displays to even just a simple overall division, having aero acoustic partitions makes for a far better barrier between workstations than walls or typical partitions.

Occupancy planning is the indispensable tool you need to encourage productivity, engagement, and retention among employees while reducing costs and staying adaptable to future needs.

Occupancy planning gives you a deep understanding of your assets, utilization data, employee sentiment, and expenses. Armed with this information, you can begin making data-backed decisions and testing their effectiveness until you develop a thriving modern work environment.Â

What is occupancy planning?

Occupancy planning is the practice of analyzing how your space is being used and making adjustments to maximize current and future utilization. Itâs an effective strategy to improve any space, from a single office to an entire corporate real estate portfolio.

Specific occupancy planning tactics will vary depending on your companyâs unique needs. However, it often includes:

Reconfiguring office floor plans for improved efficiency

Updating the ratio of workspaces to employees to account for hybrid work

Providing amenities and incentives to draw workers back to the office

Monitoring maintenance needs, and

Projecting future space requirements

Below is a look at quick look at occupancy planning in action:

The 5 main principles of occupancy planning

While occupancy planning is a robust system for space optimization, it can be broken down into five core principles.

1. Understanding expenses and assets

To make good decisions as a space or occupancy planner, you have to know what youâre working with. A comprehensive audit of your office assets and expenses will establish this. Youâll want to identify things like:

What are the overhead costs for the building?Â

How many employees do you have? Are they all full-time, in-office employees, or are some hybrid?

Whatâs the total amount of usable square footage?Â

How many conference rooms and dedicated desks do you have?Â

At what stage of the life cycle are assets such as laptops, printers, and furniture? When will they need to be replaced?

These details will help you identify benchmarks for your occupancy planning, anticipate upcoming maintenance and replacement costs, and project how much square footage is needed for future hires.

2. Using real-time and historical dataÂ

Real-time data gives you a current headcount and tells you where people are in the building right now, and historical data shows utilization trends over time. The combination of these two data sets is invaluable for smart space planning.Â

Real-time data is important for making immediate changes, such as ensuring a room doesnât exceed its maximum capacity. Itâs also essential if you plan to use software for wayfinding or workspace reservations.Â

Historical data is key for future planning. For example, do you need to add square footage to accommodate new hires, or does your average peak utilization rate leave enough room to integrate new employees without expanding? Looking at your past trends can clarify these questions.Â

3. Soliciting feedback from employees

Space management doesnât happen in a vacuum. It directly impacts the people using the environment, and it's essential to understand their opinions. If you optimize your space with only cost-cutting and efficiency in mind, you risk creating a work environment that employees donât want to be in and that doesnât allow them to do their best work.Â

You can collect employee feedback easily through workplace experience surveys. Surveying employees before you begin any occupancy planning strategies will provide a baseline you can use to measure whether future changes have had a positive or negative impact. These surveys can also identify the areas of the workplace that need the most attention.Â

4. Optimizing space utilizationÂ

This principle of occupancy planning focuses on the actions you take to improve the performance of the work environment. Space planning revolves around change and measurement. Whether you introduce a catered Taco Tuesday to boost low utilization rates or add office pods to help employees do their focused work, the steps you take to improve the work environment are a critical aspect of occupancy planning.

Reducing costs (reducing capital investments and ensuring space isn't wasted)

Capital investments are one of the top expenses for most businesses, so itâs important to get good value from your physical office space. Unfortunately, thatâs not always the case.Â

âIn the US, there are 10.9 billion square feet of leased or owned corporate office space, and 41% of that is vacant but paid for, meaning about a trillion dollars worth of space is essentially sitting there with nobody in it,â says Andrew Farah, co-founder and CEO of Density.

Not only is this underutilized space paid for, in terms of leases, but companies also waste money on utilities. Approximately $3.36 billion is spent annually on electricity to power, heat, and cool spaces that arenât used.Â

Occupancy planning helps companies reduce these unnecessary costs by increasing the utilization of these spaces or determining where they can safely downsize their capital investments without impacting day-to-day operations.Â

Why does your office need occupancy planning?Â

Cost savings : Occupancy planning can show you how to repurpose underutilized space and improve resource allocation to ensure youâre getting value for your money and avoid unnecessary new expenses. Once youâve evaluated your assets, expenses, and occupancy data, you may find that you can downsize to a smaller office space without sacrificing comfort or productivity.Â

Considering the high costs associated with recruitment and onboarding, it's wise to maintain a positive workplace experience so employees feel comfortable and supported. Sustainability: Sustainability is not just a buzzword; it's a top concern among millennial and Gen Z workers. These two generations will soon make up the majority of the workforce, and 65% of workplace leaders report theyâre already feeling pressure from employees to adopt more sustainable initiatives. Occupancy planning can improve your carbon footprint by identifying when you can downsize or repurpose square footage and ensuring utilities arenât wasted on unused spaces.Â

How to improve your occupancy planning in 4 steps

Optimization is one of the primary goals of occupancy planning, but itâs important to apply that to your facilities management process, too. Below are four ways you can enhance your occupancy planning for better results.

1. Invest in a system to track space utilizationÂ

Occupancy planning is built on utilization data. If you donât know how people are using your space, you canât make informed decisions about how to improve it.Â

Most modern offices use technology such as occupancy sensors to track utilization. There are many clear benefits of choosing utilization technology over traditional, observation-based tracking:

Provides real-time data for the entire office or building

Tracks trends over time

Can monitor offices across a portfolio

More accurate than manual methods

Automates the process

Collects unbiased data

Provides visual data thatâs easy to understand at a glance

The tracking method you choose to deploy will depend on your budget and space planning goals. A manual option can work for organizations with tight budgets and small office spaces. For larger operations and those that want to stay competitive in todayâs world of work, utilization technology is a must.

2. Identify your target metrics and KPIs

Metrics and KPIs are important tools to check the overall state of your occupancy planning and track progress toward specific goals. Common metrics for space planning include:

Peak occupancy identifies when your space is busiest. You can break this down by building, floor, or room.Â

identifies when your space is busiest. You can break this down by building, floor, or room.Â Average utilization shows the typical usage of your office. High average utilization translates to more value from that space.

shows the typical usage of your office. High average utilization translates to more value from that space. High-traffic areas are those that see the most action throughout the day. Pinpointing these enables you to predict inventory and cleaning needs.

are those that see the most action throughout the day. Pinpointing these enables you to predict inventory and cleaning needs. Meeting room utilization shows how frequently employees use meeting areas and for how long. This data shows whether the number of meeting spaces is sufficient to meet demand.

Unlike metrics, KPIs arenât universal. These are specific to your organizationâs utilization and workplace experience goals. For example, if your meeting room utilization is only 30%, you can set a KPI to increase it by 10% within three months. Your team will review utilization data and employee feedback to determine the necessary changes to reach this goal.

Using a combination of metrics and KPIs will keep you informed about workplace performance and provide clear areas to measure and improve.Â

3. Take a human-centric approach

While reducing costs is always a goal of occupancy planning, it's also critical to take a step back from the numbers and consider the people who use the space.Â

How can you optimize occupancy planning while providing a good experience?

Simply keeping the human aspect in mind will go a long way toward ensuring your utilization strategies are employee-friendly. Itâs tempting to want to maximize your space utilization by squeezing as much occupancy as you can out of each square foot, but in practice that translates to employees who are cramped, less productive, and likely looking for a new job.

You can take the human-centric approach a step further by always balancing the data provided by utilization technology with the feedback you get from employees. Data provides an unbiased look at the utilization of your space, and feedback gives context to the numbers. Both are needed to create a positive, efficient workplace.

4. Workflow automation for repetitive tasks

Thereâs an enormous number of tasks involved with operating an office, but thankfully, many of these tasks can be automated. To make the most of occupancy planning, look for any repetitive tasks that can be done with technology.Â

Here are just a few examples of automations that can benefit your space management services:

Provide software for employees to make their own room or desk reservations.

Use sensors to automatically turn off lights in unoccupied rooms.

Schedule recurring appointments for routine maintenance of equipment or building needs such as pest control.

Use software to assign tasks to your team, track work orders, and store important documents such as vendor contracts.

Install programmable thermostats to automatically adjust temperatures as needed throughout the day.

The more tasks you can automate, the more time you and your team can spend on higher-priority work such as reviewing employee feedback and brainstorming new ways to improve workplace utilization and experience.

Make occupancy planning a priority

Office space is expensive. Beyond the upfront cost of the lease, there are numerous operating costs including utilities, maintenance, and supplies. Optimizing office utilization is critical to reducing expenses and ensuring your organization is getting value from this investment.Â

The office can also be a strategic advantage for successful recruitment, higher retention, and better employee performance. Occupancy planning can help you cut costs while creating a positive, productive work environment that can give your organization an edge over the competition.",planning new office location

588,About Stolen Device Protection for iPhone,https://support.apple.com/en-gb/120340,2 дня назад,"About Stolen Device Protection for iPhone

Stolen Device Protection adds a layer of security when your iPhone is away from familiar locations, such as your home or workplace, and helps protect your accounts and personal information in case your iPhone is ever stolen.

About Stolen Device Protection

After Stolen Device Protection has been enabled, some features and actions will have additional security requirements when your iPhone is away from familiar locations, such as your home or workplace. These requirements will help prevent someone who has stolen your device and knows your passcode from making critical changes to your account or device.

Face ID or Touch ID biometric authentication: some actions, such as accessing stored passwords and credit cards, require a single biometric authentication with Face ID or Touch ID – with no passcode alternative or fallback option – so that only you can access these features.

Security Delay: some security actions, such as changing your Apple ID password, also require you to wait for an hour and then perform a second Face ID or Touch ID authentication.

In the event that your iPhone has been stolen, the security delay is designed to prevent a thief from performing critical operations so that you can mark your device as lost and make sure your Apple account is secure. Find out what to do if your iPhone has been lost or stolen.

When your iPhone is in a familiar location, these additional steps will not be required and you can use your device passcode like normal. Familiar locations typically include your home, workplace and certain other locations where you regularly use your iPhone. If you choose, you can set up Stolen Device Protection to always require these additional security measures, even when your iPhone is in a familiar location.

Stolen Device Protection is available with iOS 17.3 or later and must be turned on before the device is lost or stolen.

How to turn Stolen Device Protection on or off

To turn on Stolen Device Protection, you must use two-factor authentication for your Apple ID and set up or enable the following on your iPhone: a device passcode; Face ID or Touch ID; and Significant Locations* (Location Services).

You also need to have Find My turned on, and you can't turn it off while Stolen Device Protection is enabled.

You can turn on Stolen Device Protection in Settings:

Go to Settings, then tap Face ID & Passcode. Enter your device passcode. Tap Stolen Device Protection, then turn Stolen Device Protection on or off.

If you'd like your iPhone to enforce the additional Stolen Device Protection security measures regardless of its location, choose ""Always"" under Require Security Delay. By default, the additional security measures are required only when your iPhone is away from familiar locations.

If you try to turn off Stolen Device Protection when you’re not in a familiar location, a security delay starts before you can turn it off. You should turn off Stolen Device Protection before you sell, give away or trade in your iPhone.

How Stolen Device Protection protects your device and accounts

When Stolen Device Protection is turned on, certain actions have additional security requirements when your iPhone is away from familiar locations such as home or work.

Face ID or Touch ID biometric authentication

With Stolen Device Protection, if your iPhone is not in a familiar location, you must authenticate using Face ID or Touch ID before you can take certain actions, including the following:

Use passwords or passkeys saved in Keychain

Use payment methods saved in Safari (autofill)

Turn off Lost Mode

Erase all content and settings

Apply for a new Apple Card

View your Apple Card or Apple Cash virtual card number

Take certain Apple Cash and Savings actions in Wallet (for example, Apple Cash or Savings transfers)

Use your iPhone to set up a new device (for example, Quick Start)

You can still use your iPhone passcode for purchases with Apple Pay.

Security Delay

With Stolen Device Protection, you may also be required to wait for an hour before using your iPhone to make changes to critical security settings or your Apple ID. If your iPhone is not in a familiar location, you must authenticate using Face ID or Touch ID, wait for the security delay to end, then authenticate with Face ID or Touch ID again to update settings such as the following:

Change your Apple ID password

Sign out of your Apple ID

Update Apple ID account security settings (such as adding or removing a trusted device, Recovery Key or Recovery Contact)

Add or remove Face ID or Touch ID

Change your iPhone passcode

Reset All Settings

Turn off Find My

Turn off Stolen Device Protection

If you use your iPhone to change your Apple ID password, the location of your devices may not be visible at iCloud.com for a period of time.

Your device may end the security delay early after it has detected that you’ve arrived at a familiar location.

She has written a number of books aiming to facilitate a better understanding of construction and detailing. First In Architecture is a website providing resources and guides for architects and students.

For many people, work is their life. They spend 40+ hours a week at the office and this time can be some of the most rewarding or most frustrating depending on how well your office space is set up. The planning of a workplace or office is not just about how the space looks, but also about what is important to employees.

There are many things to take into consideration as there are different factors that can impact productivity and employee morale. Here are just a few things to consider when designing a new office or workplace.

A Changing Workplace

The shape of offices has changed over the last couple of decades, with office design becoming a way to attract talent, increase productivity and creativity, show off the companies modernity and get into architectural design websites and magazines. Google, anyone? In the 21st century, office design became fashionable.

Yet, with the era of Covid 19, work practices are rapidly changing. Suddenly, companies are not only offering flexible working hours, multiple work locations within one building, but also work from home. Only time will tell how long the work from home option continues.

These changes are leading to different new concepts for office design and a necessity for flexibility more than ever. Meeting the current needs of the organization is not the only challenge that designers face; they must also anticipate the company’s future needs and design with the adaptability required to fulfill them. Good office design has been attributed to improved health and wellbeing of employees, increased productivity, staff retention and sense of community. All the more reason to invest time and effort in creating a great office design.

Office Planning

There are many variables and factors that will inform a new workplace design and this guide cannot cover the full gamut. However, we will explore some of the design considerations and key points to address when designing a new office.

Establishing the requirements of the organization that will use the office will be one of the first aspects of the design. At this point, input from many of the end users will be useful in creating a picture of the workplace experience that the company are looking to achieve.

How Will the Office Be Used?

What are the aims and objectives of the organization? What different duties and roles are carried out in the organization and how might that change in the future? How do the employees work now, and how do they want to work? What do the employees need in order to be as effective as possible? Do visitors come to the office?

How Does the Company Want To Portray Its Brand?

Does the organization want to show its brand and personality in the design of the office? What kind of brand values and messages does the company want to portray to its employees and visitors? Many more questions can be asked about the culture of the company and more to gain a deep understanding of who the company is and what they are trying to achieve.

Journey Design

Journey design is a large part of the early office design. This goes beyond considering the journey from the entrance of the building to your desk, and how you might get there.

Journey design is about understanding the experience, through all sensory factors, in each part of the building. How are people going to interact with the building? What will their experience be and how will they perceive the company? These questions apply to both employees and visitors.

Most offices can be separated into zones:

Arrival or Entrance Zone

First entry into the office for both staff and visitors. Staff could have alternative entrance in larger office buildings. The entrance is often welcoming and open to the public.

Visitor or Public Zone

The visitor zone is where meetings may take place, whether in a formal meeting room or cafe. The visitor zone consists of employees and people that don’t work for the company. Usually, in larger offices, the visitor areas are kept separate from the main staff working areas.

Working Zone

The working zone is accessible to staff only and usually will consist of office/desk space, meeting rooms and the core functions of the company.

Social Zone

The social zone allows for more informal meetings, refreshments and other activities that aren’t suited to the working zone. How the employees and visitors journey to and through these zones should be carefully considered.

Spatial and Room Requirements

In addition to these types of questions, it is also important to establish spatial and physical requirements from the organization. In short, what rooms/spaces do they need, how many staff do they have, what size canteen will they need, how many sanitary facilities, and so on.

These spaces will perform a variety of functions. The functions will have an impact on how that space is designed. For example, if the offices require focus work, consideration will be taken in minimizing noise and creating a good working environment without distraction. Let’s look at the room types:

Focus work: routine work, long durations

Casual / informal: more mobile spaces, small short casual meetings

Private / quiet space: concentration, confidential, reflection

Group work: casual/information meeting spaces, group tasks, away from focus area

Meetings: dedicated rooms for meetings, work, learning, interviews etc.

Amenities: areas for refreshment, relaxation, social interaction, wellbeing

Services: support services such as IT, cleaning, security

Office Design Considerations

The following section will give general tips and pointers for good office design. Some of the suggestions below will be dependent on the size and nature of the office to be designed.

Accessibility and Inclusivity

All accessibility design standards should be met and exceeded where possible. Creating an inclusive and accessible office ensures it can be used by a wide and diverse range of people. Consider both visible and non visible disabilities and how the spaces can be used without the need for assistance. Spaces and facilities should be provided that avoid separation, segregation or unnecessary effort.

Flexibility

As mentioned earlier, offices are changing environments. The design must include flexibility to adapt to changes of the organization. Modular designs that are multifunctional can help to allow for these changes. Designs can also include options for easy upgrading as technology advances.

Safety and Security

Depending on the nature and location of the office, security measures are often an important consideration. Entry to the building itself should be welcoming and without obstruction, but it is often necessary to incorporate secure access to the non public areas. This should be done discreetly, and with the option of upgrading or altering as required.

Technology

Technology is a key part of a successful organization. Digital infrastructure must be integrated into the design early to ensure a strong workflows. Again, the technology must be organized and designed in such a way that upgrades are possible with minimal disruption.

Employee Wellbeing

Working to conserve employee wellbeing can come in many forms. Work is a key part of our lives and it is important that employees feel supported and are given the opportunity and amenities to flourish. If an employee is feeling physically and mentally fit, they are more likely to feel engaged and driven in the workplace.

Provide an office that is comfortable, with a healthy working environment, along with good indoor air quality with a mix of natural and mechanical ventilation. Design facilities for reflection, and ensure the use of lighting, acoustics and colors reduce stress.

If appropriate, an onsite gym or social area can also be provided.

Lighting

An office contains a variety of spaces that fullfil different roles. The lighting design will need to reflect the different spaces. For example, the reception area may be designed to be light and bright and welcoming. While office spaces might have more focused lighting and measures to prevent glare. Quiet spaces and areas for reflection will have softer lighting. The lighting design of an workplace will enhance the mood and activities of the spaces. Lighting design incorporates both natural and artificial lighting techniques.

Acoustics

Similar to lighting design, the acoustics must be designed according to the spaces and functions carried out within those spaces.

For some open plan offices provide a challenge for some employees, as noise levels and distractions around them can have a negative effect on productivity. However, if an office is too quiet some report this to be a little unnerving.

Finding a good balance in the acoustics is important. Acoustic materials that absorb excess noise can help to improve communication between teams, improve privacy for private phone calls, and allow employees to focus better on complex or concentrated tasks.

Having a variety of spaces that are acoustically designed will allow for staff to select the space according to their requirements, ie, group discussion, formal meeting and so on.

Conclusion

Office design is a large topic and we’ve only scratched the surface here. The workplace has been changing over time and offices need to be flexible, considering how they will be used with employees of different generations who have varying needs for work-life balance. These considerations also include understanding what types of space are required in an office environment given that many people today don’t just use their desktop or laptop all day long at one location. We hope this blog post has provided you with some insight into getting started on your own journey towards designing an ideal workplace!

339,Analysis of factors influencing office workplace planning ...,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/jba.2010.22,Автор: MA Hassanain,"Although the knowledge presented in this article has previously existed in several facilities management and real estate literature sources, the survey of literature revealed that there has not been a focused study on the extent of identifying the influential factors that space planners and design professionals may consider to provide sustainable, cost-effective and productive workplace facilities. This section presents a synthesis of the knowledge areas pertaining to the technical, functional and financial factors affecting office workplace planning in corporate facilities, and presenting these factors in one source.

Functional factors

The functional factors relate to the fit between the building and the user's activities. Considerations in this category are derived from the goals, objectives, and the operations of each division in the organization. The set of functional factors are discussed as follows:

Operations and activities of the organization

While the term ‘operation’ is used to describe the general process by which an organization conducts its business, the term ‘activity’ is commonly used to describe an action by which the mission of the organization is accomplished. This suggests that organizations should carry out an analysis of their operations and activities that the current or proposed workplace is required to support. This analysis would provide a description for the operations that would be conducted and the missions that the staff would be accomplishing. In view of this analysis, facility planning personnel would be guided by the previously set missions that explain why a sub-organizational unit exists; the major classes of activities that are conducted to accomplish the mission; and the number of staff and their skills or job descriptions that are associated with the organization's activities. The facility planning personnel would then be able to compile a list of all equipment items that are essential to be brought to the new workplace (Brauer, 1992).

A significant aspect of workplace planning related to the operations and activities of the organization is in the development of workplace solutions to respond to the multi-faceted types of work and ways of working. Examples of these solutions include: touchdown areas that allow staff to access information quickly; bookable offices; and group collaborative workspaces such as board rooms equipped with technology to provide teleconferencing capabilities; and hot-desking (Pitt and Bennett, 2008). Hot-desking refers to the approach of compelling employees to share workstations through providing fewer workstations than employees to achieve the objectives of attaining higher workstation utilization and reducing the costs of providing workstations (Fawcett and Rigby, 2009).

Accurate definition of user requirements

Workplace strategies as well as layouts should be in direct response to the individual and collective requirements of the occupants (McGregor, 2000). Effective practice of space management depends on a clear understanding of the requirements and the directions of the organization (Muir, 2003). The planning of the workspace in the organization should be a response to the specific requirements of the staff and the business (McGregor and Then, 2001). Requirements in building projects define what is expected from a building solution rather than describe the solution itself. User requirements are concerned with facility characteristics that would enable users to carry out their activities efficiently, safely and with regard for occupant satisfaction. There are indeed two categories of requirements. The first type is called functional requirements, which is a collection of statements and supporting data that describe what is needed in the building (Brauer, 1992). Examples of functional requirements include workspace layout, size of personal workspace, personal work surface area, furniture, workspace storage, shared equipment and social spaces (Schwede et al, 2008). The second type is called technical requirements, which describes the technical, financial, legal matters that make a project feasible (Brauer, 1992). The two types of requirements complement each other. Together they provide a complete set of information necessary to formulate an appropriate solution.

Space adjacency requirements

Co-locating team members in the same divisional unit is an apparent priority for achieving optimum levels of collaboration at the workplace (Brown, 2008). Co-locating different divisional units within the organization for the purposes of increased management effectiveness and higher productivity is a more subtle business objective (Wustemann and Booty, 2009). For developing a design solution, the space planning consultant needs to be acquainted with the preferred space adjacency demands among each divisional unit, as well as different divisions within the organization. Such information is needed to determine how spaces should be physically positioned relative to one another in a floor plan, or a site plan. Space adjacency demands could be expressed as ‘spaces must be adjacent’; ‘adjacency is preferred, but not absolutely necessary’; ‘anywhere nearby is fine’; ‘distance is not important’; and ‘spaces should be far apart or in different buildings’ (Brauer, 1992).

Development and implementation of workplace area standards

The early approaches for planning of workspaces were characterized by oversizing the amounts of space in anticipation that eventually with the increase of volume of business and the headcount within organizations, the initial excess of workspace would be absorbed. Such approaches have failed to take into consideration the present requirements of occupants, businesses and their future requirements (McGregor, 2000). Nowadays, space management has become a high priority for most office organizations, mainly due to the high cost of space, demands for more desirable space, and frequent adjustments required to accommodate the rapid growth or expansion of organizations (Brauer, 1992).

Developing and implementing space standards is one of the key responsibilities of any space management department in any organization. The development of space standards is a necessary prerequisite to the interior design process (Owen, 1993). A space standard governs the number of square meters allotted to each staff in the organization as workspace, taking into consideration the amount of space needed for a desk, chair, local storage and immediate access to the workstation (Wustemann and Booty, 2009). Space standards, while being used for minimum space allocation for staff, serve to establish guidelines and procedures for equitable distribution of space to all users based on their actual needs, hence, ensuring efficient use of space (Brauer, 1992). A further aspect of the development and implementation of workplace area standards is that space design and allocation should be based on the functions carried out in the space, rather than the traditional approach of allocating spaces based on the salary/grade hierarchy (Chilton and Baldry, 1997). Supporting this argument, Rondeau et al (1995) assert that standards are designed to ensure that employees have adequate space and furnishings to carry out the tasks assigned and are not usually subject to the whim of a supervisor.

Specification of common facilities – Areas

There exist at every workplace several types of common spaces such as conference rooms, reception areas, waiting areas, display areas and locker room. Common spaces could be rooms, work areas or other forms of spaces that serve several or all units within the organization. These common spaces are often identified by the fact that they are not managed or controlled by anyone in particular. In planning of the workplace, the space planner determines the demand for common use spaces at the organization, converts that demand into a list of shared spaces and defines user requirements for them (Brauer, 1992).

Anticipation of change in the organization

Organizations seldom remain static (McGregor and Then, 2001). When an organizations undergoes a change, so does its workplaces. An essential element in space planning is anticipating the need to accommodate future changes in the organization. There are two main apparent sources of changes. The first source can be attributed to the external changes that are usually beyond the control of the organization, such as technological changes and innovations, competition, globalization, regulation and de-regulation, and consumer behavior. An example of this category is organization's investment in information technology (NCPP, 2004). Studies have shown that technological changes in the office infrastructure, combined with space re-configuration, have the potential to enhance the effectiveness of the work environment, thus positively impacting the company structure and systems. When facilities are built or upgraded, organizations should endeavor to anticipate their information technology needs for the next 5–10 years to ensure that the new or upgraded space can meet those needs (Langston and Lauge-Kristensen, 2002). The second can be identified as the internal pressures from within the organization such as initiatives and proposals to improve flexibility and the capability to adapt to changes in the workplace, develop the culture of connecting staff and enhance communication, and improve the image of the business to attract customers and retain staff (Morgan and Anthony, 2008).

Technical factors

The technical factors relate to the health and safety of staff and visitors using the building. Considerations in this category are derived from the existing conditions of the facility as well as the mandates of the legislation for achieving a comfortable, safe and healthy workplace environment. The set of technical factors are discussed as follows:

Facility's physical constraints

Whether recycling an existing building or building a new one, the space planning personnel need to have complete set of information on the building in hand. This could be accomplished by developing a simple checklist noting all the items to be considered. Examples of items to gather information on include permissible building height, column spacing, types and finishes of floors, types of wall construction, capacities of elevators, fixture types, and illumination levels. Availability of this information facilitates the efforts of the space planner through understanding the physical constraints that may impact the planning of the workplace (Molnar, 1983).

Specification of ergonomic products

Ergonomics has become a significant design criterion that space planners are taking into consideration for achieving maximum resource efficiency and higher productivity rates at the workplace. In essence, the science of ergonomics is concerned with applying biologic and engineering data and techniques to develop solutions for the interface of the worker and the workplace (Cotts, 1999). Rondeau et al (1995) describe the term ergonomic as a design created specifically to fit human dimensions and respond to functional requirements. Functional requirements are a collection of declarations and supporting data that describe what is needed in the building. These functional requirements are based on the goals and objectives of the organization and the operations of each unit within the organization (Brauer, 1992). Ergonomic solutions relate primarily to the provision of adjustable equipment, furniture and accessories (Rondeau et al, 1995).

Provisions for the disabled

The layout of the workplace should comply with the legislative requirements governing the provision of an accommodating workplace for individuals with sensory, cogitative and mobility impairments. As an example, the Americans with Disabilities Act requires that all areas available to the public be accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities (Owen, 1993). Spaces in the building that would be affected due to the provision of handicap requirements include parking spaces, building entrances, stairs, elevators, rest rooms and workstations (Rondeau et al, 1995).

Adherence to life safety mandates

Throughout the process of workplace planning, space planning consultants and facility managers must be thoroughly familiar with the life safety requirements mandated by the local legislation. Rondeau et al (1995) indicate that fire evacuation plans, types and placement locations of fire extinguishers, sprinkler systems, unblocked exits, emergency lighting, adequate passage width, building fire alarm systems, non-combustible, flame-resistant furnishings, and unobstructed exit ways are some of the fundamental life safety concerns that must be addressed by design firms and facility professionals during the processes of space planning and interior design.

Analysis of telecommunication requirements

The workplace needs to be provided with the volume of cabling that will enable staff to handle information and communication demands at desk level. The space planner should be able to respond to individual staff needs for telephone, data terminals and other information devices in the planning of the workplace. The workplace of every staff should accordingly be provided with the appropriate number of power and data com outlets that enable staff to effectively pursue their daily business activities (Owen, 1993). Effective cable management facilitates the provision of minimal unsightly runs of wiring across the office as well as minimizes the occurrence of trip hazards at the workplace (Wustemann and Booty, 2009).

Analysis of potential demands generated by equipment on the facility

The space planner should be able to establish whether equipment items will cause some conditions that the facility must accommodate. Conditions generated by equipment that the building must accommodate include excessive levels of noises, air containments such as particulates, gases, heat, moisture and fire hazards. The purpose of analyzing such demands that are placed on the building as a result of operating certain equipment in the facility is to alert the facility planner on the effects that may affect the building and its systems, and consequently workflow and productivity levels in the organization, as well as the provisions needed to accommodate the works of these equipment items (Brauer, 1992).

Financial factors

The financial factors relate to the feasibility of the space planning project. Considerations in this category are derived from the capability of the organization to invest in, and finance prospective facility projects. The set of financial factors are discussed as follows:

Budget allocated for office workspace programming

The amount of budget allocated to commission a design professional to gather and synthesize the requirements of users, for the efficient planning of the workplace, reflects the seriousness and the commitment of the organization to the exercise of facility planning. In this exercise, the users are consulted for the objective of obtaining these requirements. Later, these professionally defined requirements are compiled into a document, usually called an ‘Architectural Program’ (Brauer, 1992). Cotts (1999), however, describes some of the factors that negatively affect the development of an architectural program as lack of familiarity with the programming process, the view that programming is a luxury or an unneeded design cost, impatience to get to a design solution, and time pressure to complete the project.

Cost of usable space

Whether buying an entire building, leasing a floor or building a new facility, operating from more space than necessary ties up capital that could be used productively elsewhere. Moreover, operating from buildings that have unneeded special features, such as overrated structural load capacity, oversized utilities, unneeded communication systems or luxurious finishes, also ties up capital that could be invested somewhere else. Nevertheless, unnecessary capital expenditures on unneeded space or unneeded building features can easily be avoided if the requirements are accurate, comprehensive and well organized. Organizations, then, would find it easy to make decisions about the amount of space to buy, build or lease (Brauer, 1992). However, rental rates should only be part of the information needed to make a valid cost comparison between different buildings. Owen (1993) argues that assuming all other factors such as location and amenities are equal, the ratio between the rentable area and the usable area may differ from one building to another. To establish this ratio, the usable area on each floor of each building is calculated, and then multiplied by the rental rate. The result is the true cost per usable square meter. Once the cost per usable square meter of each building under consideration is determined, the organization can truly compare various options and select the one that fits its requirements.

Allowable project budget

In many cases, and next to human resources, office buildings are the second largest expenditure category for business organizations (Brown, 2008), regardless of whether these buildings are owned or leased (Williams, 1996). Supporting this fact, Alexander (1997) states that organizations of all kinds in different economies around the globe recognize the increasing cost of occupying buildings and providing services to support the business operations. Once a final budget for the project is established and approved by all concerned parties in the organization, it becomes the control point for the project and should not be exceeded (Owen, 1993). Budgeting is the disciplined pre-estimation of costs, and it is a key element for the proper planning and control of any project (Langston, 2003). The categories of work for which data are needed to develop the cost estimate for space planning and relocation projects include: items that are not normally provided by the landlord; furniture and fixtures; accessories; artwork; signage and graphics: fees of external consultants; communications and data cable systems; moving costs; new equipment and installation charges; and document preparation (Owen, 1993).

Costs after moving in

When organizations move into a new or remodeled building, some of the users may find that their designated spaces do not meet their requirements for carrying out their tasks. Therefore, there is a usual period of adjustment in which users may move furniture and equipment; request a number of changes in the placement of partitions; and request modifications of lighting or thermal conditions. It is inevitable that productivity and cost of operations will be adversely affected during the adjustment to the new facility. Moreover, each required modification results in implementing a design and construction change, and consequently, an addition to the cost of the project (Brauer, 1992).

Cost per workstation

Nowadays, as working habits are becoming more flexible, the practice of providing one workstation for each employee might result in low workstation utilization and consequently additional cost to the organization. Therefore, organizations have started to devise approaches to minimize this cost through requiring employee to share workstations (Fawcett and Rigby, 2009). However, attempts to achieve cost-savings in this trait might result in decreasing the employees’ productivity due to frequent distractions and loss of concentration (Erlich and Bichard, 2008).",future office expansion plans

What is the Ansoff Matrix?

The Ansoff Matrix, often called the Product/Market Expansion Grid, is a two-by-two framework used by management teams and the analyst community to help plan and evaluate growth initiatives. In particular, the tool helps stakeholders conceptualize the level of risk associated with different growth strategies.

The matrix was developed by applied mathematician and business manager H. Igor Ansoff and was published in the Harvard Business Review in 1957. The Ansoff Matrix is often used in conjunction with other business and industry analysis tools, such as the PESTEL, SWOT, and Porter’s 5 Forces frameworks, to support more robust assessments of drivers of business growth.

Understanding the Ansoff Matrix

The Ansoff Matrix is a fundamental framework taught by business schools worldwide. It is a simple and intuitive way to visualize the levers a management team can pull when considering growth opportunities. It features Products on the X-axis and Markets on the Y-axis.

The concept of markets within the Ansoff framework can mean different things. For example, it could be a jurisdiction or geography (i.e., the North American market); it could also mean customer segments (i.e., target market/demographic).

The Matrix is used to evaluate the relative attractiveness of growth strategies that leverage both existing products and markets vs. new ones, as well as the level of risk associated with each.

Each box of the Matrix corresponds to a specific growth strategy. They are:

Market Penetration – The concept of increasing sales of existing products into an existing market Market Development – Focuses on selling existing products into new markets Product Development – Focuses on introducing new products to an existing market Diversification – The concept of entering a new market with altogether new products

Market Penetration

The least risky, in relative terms, is market penetration.

When employing a market penetration strategy, management seeks to sell more of its existing products into markets that they’re familiar with and where they have existing relationships. Typical execution strategies include:

Increasing marketing efforts or streamlining distribution processes

Decreasing prices to attract new customers within the market segment

Acquiring a competitor in the same market

Consider a consumer packaged goods business that sells into grocery chains. Management may seek greater penetration by amending pricing for a large chain in order to secure incremental shelf space not just for packaged food products but also for several lines of its pet food products, too.

Market Development

A market development strategy is the next least risky because it does not require significant investment in R&D or product development. Rather, it allows a management team to leverage existing products and take them to a different market. Approaches include:

Catering to a different customer segment or target demographic

Entering a new domestic market (regional expansion)

Entering into a foreign market (international expansion)

An example is Lululemon; management made a decision to aggressively expand into the Asia Pacific market to sell its already very popular athleisure products. While building an advertising and logistics infrastructure in a foreign market inherently presents risks, it’s made less risky by virtue of the fact that they’re selling a product with a proven roadmap.

Product Development

A business that firmly has the ears of a particular market or target audience may look to expand its share of wallet from that customer base. Think of it as a play on brand loyalty, which may be achieved in a variety of ways, including:

Investing in R&D to develop an altogether new product(s).

Acquiring the rights to produce and sell another firm’s product(s).

Creating a new offering by branding a white-label product that’s actually produced by a third party.

An example might be a beauty brand that produces and sells hair care products that are popular among women aged 28-35. In an effort to capitalize on the brand’s popularity and loyalty with this demographic, they invest heavily in the production of a new line of hair care products, hoping that the existing target market will adopt it.

Diversification

In relative terms, a diversification strategy is generally the highest risk endeavor; after all, both product development and market development are required. While it is the highest risk strategy, it can reap huge rewards – either by achieving altogether new revenue opportunities or by reducing a firm’s reliance on a single product/market fit (for whatever reason).

There are generally two types of diversification strategies that a management team might consider:

1. Related Diversification – Where there are potential synergies that can be realized between the existing business and the new product/market.

An example is a producer of leather shoes that decides to produce leather car seats. There are almost certainly synergies to be had in sourcing raw materials, although the product itself and the production process will require considerable investment in R&D and production.

2. Unrelated Diversification – Where it’s unlikely that any real synergies will be realized between the existing business and the new product/market.

Let’s work on the leather shoe producer example again. Consider if management wanted to reduce its overall reliance on the (highly cyclical) consumer discretionary high-end shoe business, they might invest heavily in a consumer packaged goods product in order to diversify.

Ansoff Matrix and Financial Analysis

It’s a common misconception that financial analysis is exclusively a quantitative exercise. And while it’s true that analysts must know how to make sense of assets and liabilities, dig through 10K filings, and build financial models, it’s also imperative that they understand the drivers of business growth, as these will inform a wide range of model assumptions.

The ability to translate qualitative findings from a SWOT or PESTEL analysis, an Ansoff Matrix, or a Porter’s 5 Forces framework into model assumptions is what sets world-class analysts apart from everyone else.

High-quality due diligence includes the ability to effectively model growth drivers, as these can have a profound impact on valuation estimates and important credit metrics.

The concept of the Azabudai Hills is a ""MODERN URBAN VILLAGE""; it aims to be a huge open space at the heart of Tokyo filled with lush greenery that will bring people closer together and build a new community. The project will seamlessly weave offices, residences, a hotel, an international school, retail shops, restaurants and cultural facilities into the fabric of everyday life, encompassing work, learning, recreation, interaction and relaxation. This visionary project also aims to create ""a city within a city"", which will constitute the ""Hills of the future"" by utilizing past experiences in the Hills-series of redevelopments. After spending 30 years on discussing and planning this project, under construction since August 2019 and now open in the city center. Mori Building enhances the magnetism of Tokyo by developing and nurturing the city together with local people. 麻布台ヒルズ開業ムービー2023｜The Lighting Ceremony〈TVCM30秒Ver.〉 Azabudai Hills movie 2023｜GREEN, LIFE, TOKYO. Azabudai Hills Official Website History Concept Project Overview Facility Overview Initiatives for Safety, Environment and Culture Architects and Designers Data Sheet

History The Azabudai Hills site encompasses a long, narrow district running from east to west, originally broken up by hills and valleys in a convoluted terrain. The fragmented district was populated with small, old wooden houses and buildings, many of which were deteriorating. Overall the city infrastructure was in need of an upgrade.

The Council of Redeveloping Cities was established in 1989. Since then, in collaboration with some 300 landowners representing different positions and circumstances, the Toranomon-Azabudai area was discussed and planned over more than 30 years. In 2017, the City Plan was approved based on the Law of National Strategic Special Zones, and following approval of the establishment of Toranomon-Azabudai District Urban Redevelopment Association, construction began on August 5, 2019. It opened in November 24, 2023. Aerial view of the project site before redevelopment Azabudai Hills area before redevelopment Azabudai Hills area before redevelopment Learn More

Concept ""Modern Urban Village"" A Huge Open Space Filled with Lush Greenery Bringing People Together Azabudai Hills is a completely new urban development, unparalleled in terms of its development philosophy.

As technology advances, drastically changing ways of working and living, questions like ""What should a future city be like?"" and ""What is the essence of a city?"" abound. Mori Building has always believed that ""the essence of a city exists within people living and working there."" Our ideas have continued to evolve, and now our approach is completely centered on people, and urban environments as places where people live and work in vibrant and creative ways.

The concept of Azabudai Hills is a Modern Urban Village, a huge open space in the heart of Tokyo filled with lush greenery that brings people together to build a new community. The two pillars of the Modern Urban Village are ""Green & Wellness,"" which support the formation of a diverse new community where people can enjoy genuine human lives in an overwhelmingly verdant environment in harmony with nature. Concept movie | Living in a city Green & Wellness for Enhanced Lifestyles The two pillars of this ""MODERN URBAN VILLAGE"" are ""GREEN"" and ""WELLNESS"". Overwhelmingly verdant, a diverse community assembles in an environment that is in harmony with nature, forming a new community where people can genuinely live human lives.

Architectural planning of the project began with planning the flow of people and a seamless landscape with a central square at the heart of the city. Proper locations were then considered for three high-rise towers to melt into the lush greenery. This is the opposite of the traditional approach of placing the buildings first and then filling in the rest of the space with greenery. By utilizing the topographical differences of the area, and providing greenery among the entire site –including the low-rise rooftops of podium buildings – we will manage to produce a 2.4ha green space including the 6,000m² central square in a heart of this city. In this project, a relaxing atmosphere full of nature will be created by realizing a seamless urban oasis filled with trees, flowers and waterscapes.

Furthermore, the entire city is promoting citywide efforts to sustainability, such as decarbonize and recycle resources. 100% of the electricity supplied to the complex will come from renewable sources, meeting the targets set by the Renewable Energy 100% (RE100) international environmental initiative led by the UK's Climate Group.

Azabudai Hills is on track to receive a top-level Platinum certification for two category in the Leadership in Energy & Environmental Design (LEED) - ND (Neighborhood Development) category for mixed-use developments and BD+C (Building & Design/Core and Shell Development certification for newly constructed tenant buildings.

Project Overview Compact ""City within a City"" Concentrating Urban Functions within Walking Distance The Azabudai Hills site lies adjacent to the ARK Hills complex at the midpoint between Roppongi Hills, the ""Cultural Heart of Tokyo,"" and Toranomon Hills, the ""Global Business Center,"" in an area with both cultural and business personalities.

The vast 8.1-hectare area will be filled with lush greenery as a verdant urban oasis with approx. 24,000m² of greenery, including in its approx. 6,000m² central square. The complex will have a total floor area of approx. 861,700m², including approx. 214,500m² of office space, approx. 1,400 residential units and Mori JP Tower soaring to a height of approx. 330 meters. This mixed-use complex will be able to host some 20,000 employees and 3,500 residents, and welcome 30 million visitors per year.

In total, Azabudai Hills will become ""a city within a city"" as the ""Hills of the future,"" leveraging the learnings and experiences of past Hills-series developments. Site Plan Cross Section Plan Traffic Flow Throughout Entire Area to be Greatly Enhanced by Integrating Fragmented Roadways Although Azabudai Hills is well served by Sakurada-dori, Gaien-higashi-dori and Azabu-dori avenues on the area's perimeter, the original east-west roads were fragmented and the main north-south street, commonly known as Onemichi, did not merge with Gaien-higashi-dori, resulting in a highly inefficient traffic network that had plagued the area for decades.

With the development of Azabudai Hills, however, the long-held dream of an efficient road network will be realized through the creation and integration of east-west and north-south streets. In addition, construction of a barrier-free underground walkway connecting Roppongi-itchome station and Kamiyacho station will further improve circulation in the area and its surrounding neighborhoods.

Facility Overview A Complex that Seamlessly Connects Diverse Aspects of Human Life Azabudai Hills will be an urban environment that seamlessly connects diverse aspects of human life, including living, working, gathering, relaxing, learning and recreating. As a result, it will realize rich ""Hills Life,"" allowing people to live in harmony with nature, form a thriving community and enjoy creative, stimulating lives. The entire complex, full of lush greenery, will become a place of learning, working, living and recreating, all within walking distance. International-standard offices to meet global needs

Approx. 214,500m² of space will accommodate about 20,000 people in advanced office facilities that provide added value, including robust BCP and RE100-compliant power for all facilities to support new free and creative workstyles. Hills House, a base for turning the entire complex into a workplace

Hills House will function as a ""clubhouse"" where employees of tenant companies can access various functions and services at Azabudai Hills, enabling their employers to collaborate with the complex to organize ideal new ways of working. Tokyo Venture Capital Hub, Japan's first VC cluster

Some 70 independent and corporate venture-capital firms will gather in this hub, providing a base for the provision of the critical capital needed to fund the growth of startups, thereby helping to revitalize the Japanese economy. Center for Preventive Medicine for longer healthy lives

Patients will receive customized healthcare including high-precision physical examinations by specialist university hospital personnel using state-of-the-art equipment. The clinic will also conduct research into advanced methods of preventive medicine. Aman Residences, Tokyo; the ultimate in serene living

Azabudai Hills has partnered with Aman, the operator of luxury diverse world-class hotels and resorts, to create a unique and exclusive 91-unit residence that delivers exceptional value. Residences that maximize urban affluence amidst greenery

Initiatives for Safety, Environment and Culture Safety: Hard and Soft Initiatives to Support Life and Business in Times of Disaster As part of the Azabudai Hills' initiatives to strengthen the safety of urban infrastructure, Mori Building is making great efforts to create urban refuges that people can run to in the event of a disaster.

The three towers of Azabudai Hills incorporate earthquake-resistant features that will allow businesses to continue operating even in the event of an earthquake of the magnitude of the Great East Japan Earthquake. Mori JP Tower is also equipped with a co-generation system and district heating/cooling systems in its basement. Mori Building will be able to supply 100% of the electricity and heat required in the entire Azabudai Hills complex in the event of a disaster, using emergency generators. In addition, Azabudai Hills will have about 6,000m² of shelter that can temporarily accommodate up to 3,600 stranded people in the event of an emergency. Environment: Creating Rich Green Space and Reducing Rnvironmental Impact In terms of environmental impact, energy efficiency throughout the Azabudai Hills complex will be optimized on a comprehensive basis by using zero-emissions renewable energy. In addition, a high-efficiency energy center will be established to supply energy to the entire Azabudai Hills complex, to realize the efficient management of this large complex's unique mixed-use energy consumption.

Furthermore, sewage heat, an underutilized renewable energy source, will be incorporated into the heating and cooling system throughout Azabudai Hills. All electricity supplied to the entire neighborhood will be renewable, meeting the targets stipulated in the RE100 international environmental initiative led by the UK's Climate Group. The development is one of the world's largest sites to receive preliminary WELL certification, and has also earned LEED-ND and LEED-BD+C certifications. Working with external facilities and medical institutions, the project envisages an urban environment that will enable all those living and working on-site to enjoy true wellness. In sum, Azabudai Hills will introduce a range of solutions to address modern-world issues, including decarbonization, biodiversity preservation, health enhancement and more. Culture: Presenting a Diverse Range of Cultures to the World from Modern Art to Entertainment At Azabudai Hills, which focuses on ""Green & Wellness,"" Mori Building's approach has been based on the concept of making the ""whole city as a museum."" At the center of the overall facility is a museum and art gallery with a total space of around 9,300m². Public art installations are dotted throughout the area, in offices, residences, hotel lobbies and squares, creating a urban space where art and culture blend seamlessly.

Architects and Designers Collaboration with Top Global Innovators Top global creators who were invited to join the Azabudai Hills project came together to refine the overall plan.

The appearance of the three skyscrapers was designed by Pelli Clarke & Partners (USA), who designed skyscrapers that became landmarks in many countries. They also designed Mori Building's Atago Green Hills and ARK Hills Sengokuyama Mori Tower in Tokyo. César Pelli, a founder of Pelli Clarke & Partners and a great architect, believed that individual architectural designs exist to make better cities, which closely matched the philosophy of Mori Building. Public realm and lower-level architecture was created by Heatherwick Studio (UK) led by Thomas Heatherwick, a designer who has worked on many ingenious projects such as the Olympic Cauldron for the London 2012 Olympic Games. Azabudai Hills is the studio's first project in Japan to go into construction. Under the strong leadership of Mori Building, these talented creators all over the world came together to realize a highly diverse yet harmoniously unified large-scale urban complex.

Working from home? Logging in at the beach? Heading into the office? Or mixing it up? There’s no one way to work since COVID shook up the world of work.

Across the globe, hybrid working has become the norm. Business owners, leaders, and commercial property landlords are juggling staff and/​or tenancy requirements vs empty floor space and wondering how they can entice more workers back to the office.

281,Best Practices & Tips When Moving to a New Office | Crewcare,https://crewcare.co.nz/blog/tips-moving-new-office/,,"Moving offices is an exciting and transformative step. It shows that your business, no matter the size or industry, is ready for change and growth. Before all that change and growth happens, however, you first need to plan how you’re going to move and then actually make the move.

What you must remember is that there are certain differences between moving into an office for the first time and moving offices from an old space. For example, you already have existing equipment and furniture. Unless you’re throwing away or donating the whole lot, you’re going to have to make adjustments to fit everything in the new space.

To make things a little easier and more seamless, check out these best practices when moving to a new office.

Plan Early and Carefully

This is the most important part of moving offices. Once you’ve found a place for the relocation, the next immediate step should be planning the move. Allocate about three months for this stage, which involves multiple facets. First, you have to plan the layout of the entire space. Are you going to be in an expansive warehouse-type office or will you be occupying multiple floors? You also have to account for important details like the number and location of electrical outlets, windows, and storage areas. There are times when you have to hire contractors like carpenters and electricians so you can truly maximise the space.

Planning also involves proper scheduling. When do you need to have everything ready? More importantly, when is the actual moving date? If you’re scheduling it on a business day, this means you won’t be able to accommodate client requirements, appointments, and the like. Make sure you coordinate this with the parties concerned. You also have to settle if you’re planning to move in phases or do it all in one day. Finally, make sure that you have a detailed budget.

Find a Moving AND a Cleaning Company

Another important part of the planning stage is finding not just a moving company but also a commercial cleaning crew. For the moving company, check their range of services. There are those classified as full service, meaning they will do everything for you. This includes safely boxing or wrapping your equipment and furniture, and then unwrap and unpack them upon delivery. However, do note that full service movers will cost more. A key thing is to check their experience and quality of work, especially with regards to handling sensitive equipment such as computer servers.

Meanwhile, for the cleaning company, make sure you hire a reputable group. You don’t want to move into your new office with dust and dirt still fluttering around, do you? Cleaning crews ensure that the place is organised and spotless; they can also take care of your rubbish and recycling, ensuring that they get disposed of properly. In times of pandemics and other health emergencies, check if the cleaning company also offers deep cleaning services to ensure the safety of your personnel.

Organise and Label Everything

Even if you’re hiring a full service moving company, you still have to be on top of the packing. Make sure that everything is properly inventoried and labeled; this makes the moving-in process so much easier. Sort or group your supplies and equipment, then pack them in accordingly. This way, once you move in, you can easily find everything and set them up. For your staff, give them enough time to sort their desks. Give them each a box and some packaging tapes, then ask them to properly label their stuff as well. Make sure to give them a clear schedule, so they’re not rushing to get their things in order. Most won’t need more than a couple of hours to pack, but it’s still best to allocate ample time to prevent any last-minute rush.

Assign a Moving Team or Coordinator

For a smoother transition from your old office to the new, consider appointing a moving team or coordinator. They will be responsible for ensuring that everyone and everything is ready for the big move. In addition, the moving team or coordinator will be the point-person just in case anyone has questions regarding the schedule and other details. For bigger offices, it’s a good idea to assign a person or two to be the coordinators per department.

Inform ALL Stakeholders

Moving offices also means changing addresses, at the very least. Make sure to inform everyone that needs to be informed, including labour unions, clients and partners, as well as utility companies. Do this in advance, and then again once you’ve moved and settled in to the office. It’s also a good idea to pre-order business cards and other items such as office stationery to bear your new address. This way, you can hit the ground running once you’ve moved.

Moving offices takes a lot of tedious work. However, putting in the effort means everyone in your office will have a smooth transition from the old to the new place. Keep these tips in mind and you’ll have an easy time keeping things in order.

349,Best Practices to Employ Before Committing to Your Next ...,https://hhendy.com/best-practices-to-employ-before-committing-to-your-next-office-space/,,"Presented by: CoreNet Global, The LEADER

Author: Anna Alm-Grayhek, Hendy

The sharing economy, ever-increasing traffic congestion, cloud technologies, machine-learning, and artificial intelligence (AI) are just a few examples of the disruptive forces that continue to radically alter how, when and where work is getting done. Today, many organizations face increased uncertainty about the future composition of their workforce and what type of environment they should be building to better support that work. Given that change is continuous and inevitable, you might be asking how you can confidently move forward with planning your next office space. Here are some best practices to consider that will

help mitigate risk before committing to your next lease.

Develop a flexible model

Develop a workplace strategy that includes access to spaces that are on-demand or more activity-based. Building in the flexibility for your employees to work anywhere and at any time will provide your organization with the ability to accommodate a more varied and fluid workforce. Also, partner with a professional who can help evaluate and implement the strategies and spaces that best suit your organization. Here are some design strategies to consider:

Technology integration. Consider how implementing a technology system might improve your space usage and efficiency. These can include booking systems, utilization sensors or seat-reservation apps for “free address” – an environment where employees can choose to where to work within the office – that can help manage predetermined personal preferences.

Consider how implementing a technology system might improve your space usage and efficiency. These can include booking systems, utilization sensors or seat-reservation apps for “free address” – an environment where employees can choose to where to work within the office – that can help manage predetermined personal preferences. Go universal. Since working in the digital age has removed many of the physical requirements – and most of the necessary resources have gone virtual – the variety of space types previously needed within an office has been dramatically reduced. Establishing universal office standards with a few limited sizes and types of workspaces can maximize the usefulness of your new workplace, allowing groups to expand or contract with minimal disruption.

Establishing universal office standards with a few limited sizes and types of workspaces can maximize the usefulness of your new workplace, allowing groups to expand or contract with minimal disruption. Go mobile. Products that allow for easy and cost effective reconfiguration without the need for special tools or construction can help you be more agile in a

volatile environment. Examples such as desk systems on casters, mobile screens, and monitors that are furniture based rather than wall-mounted can help reduce the need to tear down and relocate expensive millwork and audio-visual systems or to hire a contractor to get the job done. You might also consider using a kit-of parts instead of rigid standards, which allows for both flexibility and personalization in the workplace.

Consider an HR strategy

Prior to committing to your next office lease, consider implementing an HR strategy complete with training opportunities for new and existing employees and a new hiring and staffing approach that not only aligns with your business objectives but complements your workplace layout. Here’s a closer look at what elements you should consider:

Cross-train your workforce. Your employees are your most valuable and expensive asset, so make sure that they are fully prepared to meet the new challenges in the future workplace. Consider implementing training opportunities in which employees can learn how to best utilize the new space, software and technologies. Targeted training programs can help ensure that your team is able to support your organization’s needs as it moves into the future.

Your employees are your most valuable and expensive asset, so make sure that they are fully prepared to meet the new challenges in the future workplace. Consider implementing training opportunities in which employees can learn how to best utilize the new space, software and technologies. Targeted training programs can help ensure that your team is able to support your organization’s needs as it moves into the future. Hire employees on an as-needed basis. The gig economy has resulted in many freelancers who enjoy the freedom of working on their own terms. These can include highly specialized design, graphics, or virtual modeling professionals. You also can take advantage of a workforce that is in a different time zone, enabling you to get additional work done when your office is closed.

Have an exit strategy

Engage design professionals. Utilize real estate professionals and designers to pre-plan your suite with an optional sublease or give-back space in mind. Working with a professional who is familiar with local codes and exiting requirements is essential to ensure that you don’t find yourself stuck with unleasable space.

Utilize real estate professionals and designers to pre-plan your suite with an optional sublease or give-back space in mind. Working with a professional who is familiar with local codes and exiting requirements is essential to ensure that you don’t find yourself stuck with unleasable space. Plan wisely. Keep vital elements in a central location so that you can maintain your core infrastructure without an expensive remodel should you need to downsize or expand. This might also be the right time to re-evaluate your current technology solutions. For example, one consideration is moving servers off-site or to a cloudbased platform rather than keeping them on the premises.

This might also be the right time to re-evaluate your current technology solutions. For example, one consideration is moving servers off-site or to a cloudbased platform rather than keeping them on the premises. Select real estate that will best suit your needs. If you’re looking to add amenities that will support your corporate culture and attract the right talent (e.g., fitness facilities, food offerings, or day care) a better option might be to find an existing development that already has these elements built in. This will alleviate the need to build out costly and often highly customized spaces.

Employ change management

Lastly, implement a change-management strategy. Changing your workplace environment, employee behaviors, and protocols requires a formalized approach. Failing to recognize the risks of not properly preparing and engaging your staff significantly reduces the likelihood that these new strategies will be fully adopted. In addition, these new ways of working require guidance to maximize your chances of success. A change-management professional can assist you with developing the appropriate strategy, building the right internal team, and determining communications and training plans so your team members are ready to work in their new, dynamic environment from the day they move in.",future office expansion plans

Moving offices can take months to plan, as you have to find the perfect location and develop a detailed schedule with your entire team. The following tips can help you have a seamless office relocation with less stress:

Organize Documents

One of the first things you should do when planning an office relocation is gathering and organize the necessary documents. These can include insurance records, contracts, and other agreements. This prevents any important information from getting lost. You can keep these documents organized digitally or in a physical file folder.

Discuss Moving Needs With Your Team

It would be best to inform your employees about the move early in the process so they can be involved and contribute what they want to look for in a new space. You can do this via digital communication or hold a meeting to discuss the following information:

The date of the move

The new office location

Important features of the new space

Reasons for the move

Anything they need to do to prepare for the move

What they can expect in the coming months

After the meeting, you can get feedback from your team on anything they would like to see in the new office. This helps ensure the new space is perfect for your employees and will also help to make sure the process is more efficient.

Think About Budget

Another critical element of planning an office relocation is your budget. We understand this can be a daunting task, so our team can coordinate a budget analysis session with you to go over your move’s logistics and devise a customized plan to provide all services you need in a cost-effective manner.

Keep Your Employees Informed

43,Birdon America to Expand Jefferson Parish Marine ...,https://bizneworleans.com/birdon-america-to-expand-jefferson-parish-marine-engineering-office/,15 часов назад,"ELMWOOD, La. – Birdon America, the U.S. arm of an Australia-based marine engineering and construction firm, announced it will expand its Jefferson Parish office to provide engineering design, supply chain, construction, and program management support for a new $1.1 billion U.S. Coast Guard contract.

The company plans to invest $3.3 million and create 25 direct new jobs at an average salary of $99,395 to oversee engineering and project management of construction and delivery of 27 state-of-the-art waterways commerce cutter vessels. Birdon will retain 12 existing positions, and Louisiana Economic Development (LED) estimates the project will result in 32 indirect jobs, for a total of 69 new and retained jobs in the Southeast Region.

“Birdon America’s decision to stay and grow in Louisiana to help build the vessels that protect our ports is a testament to the economic impact of Louisiana’s longstanding support for the U.S. military and national defense,” said LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois in a press release. “A billion-dollar defense contract, high-paying new engineering jobs and the local expansion of a respected global employer demonstrate what is possible for maritime companies doing business in our state.”

- Sponsors -

The U.S. Coast Guard awarded the contract in 2023 to enhance maintenance and protection of the U.S. Intracoastal and Inland Marine Transportation System. An estimated 630 million tons of cargo is transported through this vital 12,000-mile system of commercially active waterways, accounting for more than $5.4 trillion of annual commerce and supporting 30.7 million U.S. jobs.

“Louisiana is a major hub for shipbuilding in America,” said Robert Scott, president of Birdon America. “It made sense to grow in this area based on the history of the workforce, supply chain availability for shipbuilding and geographic proximity to bodies of water. Birdon’s commitment to helping grow the defense industry base is shown by over 98% of our suppliers are U.S. companies and 70% of the contract will be performed by small businesses, many of them in Louisiana.”

Birdon said it will collaborate with leading defense technology partners to integrate state-of-the-art systems for enhanced performance and efficiency. The 27 vessels will be constructed by Birdon over a 10-year period.

“We are honored that Birdon America has chosen to continue calling Jefferson Parish home,” said Jefferson Parish President Cynthia Lee Sheng. “They are able to serve our nation from right here in Jefferson Parish thanks to a skilled workforce, ease of accessibility and a strong supply chain that can support this kind of work. We commend Birdon America for their important and far-reaching impact. We look forward to supporting their efforts on this project and many others in the future.”

LED offered an incentives package that included LED FastStart workforce development solutions. The company is also expected to participate in the state’s Quality Jobs program.

Birdon is a diversified global group of companies in the maritime, military and resource sectors. It has operations across the United States, Australia, Europe and Asia. Established in 1977 in Port Macquarie, New South Wales, Australia, Birdon expanded to the U.S. in 2009 and established headquarters in Denver.

15,Bjarke Ingels Group: BIG,https://big.dk/,,"The industrial areas in the Copenhagen suburbs are next in line for urban development. A new light rail is planned to interconnect 20 development zones with a total area of 11 Km2, the size of the entire inner city.

BIG proposes to turn the light rail line into a spine of dense urbanity with a series of peaks at the stations. By combing the rail with strategies for energy exchange, waste management, water treatment and electric car stations, the infrastructure could become the base for a new sustainable ring of development around Copenhagen, and an artery of true urbanity pumping life into the heart of the suburbs. At certain points the rail becomes a building itself almost like a Roman aqueduct passing through the suburbs, at other points it forms small pockets of urbanity around the stations.

The proposal includes upgrades to the planned light rail by extending it to form a regional ring around Oresund connecting similar development areas, and creating a new 50 year development perspective for a cross border region between Sweden and Denmark. Where the Finger Plan from 1947 was about connectivity from suburb to center the Loop City is linking a string of highly differentiated urban nodes, universities and working spaces in a center-less metropolitan region around a blue void.

This ring, comparable in size to the San Francisco Bay area, has enough development areas to contain the growth of the region the next 50 years, and could become a model for a both sustainable, dense and super recreational development of the region.",plans to open new office

The money manager’s total leased space would increase to 1.06 million square feet (98,500 square meters) at Rudin’s 345 Park Ave., according to a person familiar with the matter. The deal would also extend Blackstone’s lease at the skyscraper through the end of 2034, the person said, asking not to be named citing private discussions.

With the new lease terms, Blackstone will occupy roughly 55% of the building spanning 28 floors, up from 42% today, the person said. The deal is expected to include efforts to expand and enhance the facilities with amenities such as a fitness center.

“We are expanding our commitment to our New York-based workforce, midtown Manhattan and New York City with this extension,” a Blackstone spokesperson said in an emailed statement. “We are excited that 345 Park Ave. will remain our global headquarters.”

Business Insider earlier reported the lease details.

Blackstone has been taking more office space in New York. The firm more than doubled its space at 601 Lexington Ave. in 2022 and also expanded at 345 Park Ave. a year before that.

The private equity firm has been at its headquarters since 1988, when it started with two floors spanning 70,000 square feet. The firm has a total of 1.4 million square feet in New York, across 345 Park Ave. and 601 Lexington Ave.

“For over 30 years, Blackstone has proudly maintained its global headquarters at 345 Park Ave., and we look forward to continuing this strong partnership,” a Rudin spokesperson said. “The decision of a premier financial services firm such as Blackstone to extend and expand its footprint is a testament to the long-term resiliency of New York City.”

172,Blaze Pizza is moving its headquarters to Atlanta,https://restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/blaze-pizza-moving-its-headquarters-atlanta,4 июн. 2024 г.,"Nearly one-third of Blaze Pizza's locations are in California. | Photo: Shutterstock.

The fast-casual franchise Blaze Pizza is moving its headquarters from Pasadena, California, to Atlanta, the company said on Tuesday, joining a growing roster of companies hoping that new digs will ignite growth.

The company said that it expects the move to be complete by September. The city will be the headquarters for operations, business development, marketing, finance, human resources and other departments.

Most of Blaze’s 60 corporate employees will remain remote, with a “small percentage” of Southern California-based workers offered the opportunity to relocate to Atlanta.

“California is where this brand was born more than a decade ago, and we have a tremendous heart for communities across the state where so many of our restaurants are,” CEO Beto Guajardo said in a statement. “Moving our corporate headquarters to Atlanta will help us drive our next wave of growth.”

Several restaurant chains in recent years have opted to move headquarters, frequently to Southeastern states where population growth is highest. The drive-thru coffee chain Dutch Bros is opening a support center in Arizona, which is expected to house 40% of support operations by January.

Papa Johns, the pizza chain, opened a second headquarters in Atlanta. Subway opened a second headquarters in Miami. Chipotle moved its headquarters from Denver to Southern California.

In Blaze’s case, the move will take headquarters away from the state where nearly one-third of its restaurants operate. Blaze at the end of 2023 operated 295 units in the U.S., 93 of which are in California, according to data from Restaurant Business sister company Technomic.

The chain operates five locations in Georgia. It does operate 28 restaurants in neighboring Florida.

Blaze's sales stagnated last year, in part due to unit count declines. Global system sales increased 0.3%, according to data from Technomic. Unit count declined 4%, thanks largely to closures of international restaurants. But the chain shrunk by seven restaurants last year, according to Technomic.

It finished 2023 with 314 restaurants, 295 of which are in the U.S. All but 12 of those restaurants are franchised.

The Blues have officially unveiled their succession plans for hockey operations. The franchise announced Alexander Steen has signed a five-year contract and will become the team's general manager in 2026. St. Louis also extended Doug Armstrong's contract through the 2028-29 season where he will continue to serve as the president of hockey operations after Steen takes over as the Blues' General Manager.

For the next two seasons, Armstrong will still be the franchise's president of hockey operations and general manager while Steen will serve as special assistant to the general manager as he prepares to become the team's 12th general manager in franchise history.

Steen served as a European development consultant in St. Louis' hockey operations department last season, and before that, Steen played 15 seasons in the NHL. During his career in St. Louis, Steen appeared in 765 regular season games and 91 playoff matchups with the Blues. Before retiring as a member of the St. Louis Blues in 2020, he posted the fourth-most games played, 10th-most goals, sixth-most assists, sixth-most points and sixth-most game-winning goals in franchise history. Steen also played in all 26 playoff games during the team's first Stanley Cup Championship run.

Armstrong has helped guide the Blues to 601 regular season wins during his 14 years with the club, the fifth-most victories in the NHL during that span, including three Central Division titles, 10 postseason appearances and the team's first Stanley Cup Championship in 2019. The Blues' longest-tenured and winningest general manager in team history was also honored as the NHL's General Manager of the Year in 2012.

Last month, the Blues also named Drew Bannister as the team's new head coach and signed him to a two-year contract extension after he served as the interim leader of the team for most of last season.

St. Louis just missed out on a playoff spot during the 2023-24 campaign, finishing the season with a 43-33 overall record and 92 points.",announced plans for new office

Before you expand your global business, you must understand all the options available to you and weigh them against one another to determine which is the wisest business decision. Understanding the difference between a branch office and a subsidiary is essential to know how you want to scale your company and the benefits of various growth forms. This article highlights what branches and subsidiaries are, the difference between a subsidiary and a branch, and the advantages and disadvantages of each option.

What Is a Branch Office? A branch office is an office where your company conducts its business. Although opening branches is becoming less desirable for many companies due to the move toward remote work, branch offices are essential to running a business by providing a physical workplace where employees and clients can meet. Think of traditional office space as a branch; if a company has one office in Los Angeles and another in San Francisco, then there is a branch office in each city, but they are simply different offices for the same company. The people working in both cities are employees of the same company and may even work together regularly. Companies typically open more branches to hire employees in new areas and expand into new markets. Still, each company branch is working toward a unified goal of ensuring the business thrives. Branch offices benefit companies because they allow one or more company representatives to operate in different geographical locations, an essential function for many businesses providing goods and services.

What Is a Subsidiary? The concept of a subsidiary is slightly more complex than a branch, as a subsidiary is a separate company. A different company, either a holding company or a parent company, owns a subsidiary company. A holding company is a company that doesn't offer any goods or services but instead exists to own majority stock in subsidiary companies. By contrast, a parent company is the primary shareholder in subsidiary companies and plays an active role in the business conducted in its subsidiaries. Whether your company is considered a holding company or parent company, you must own more than half of the shares in the subsidiary company to maintain control and sell the subsidiary. However, your company can own up to 100% of the subsidiary, which is called a wholly owned subsidiary. Companies often opt to own subsidiaries as it diversifies their business offerings. Take the company, Proctor & Gamble, for example; P & G owns dozens of subsidiary companies in the home and personal care industries, including Tide, Oral-B, and Pepto Bismol. Because they own these subsidiaries, they can appeal to customers with various needs.

Branch vs. Company: Forming a Subsidiary or Opening up a Branch Office Now that you understand the difference between a branch and a subsidiary, you may wonder which option is best for your expanding business. To answer this, you should evaluate your business needs to determine which option you should pursue. When evaluating a subsidiary vs. a branch, you should consider which will best meet your business needs. A branch office benefits companies that need to grow their business into new physical markets. For example, allowing local practitioners to use your products is a necessary part of your business operations if you sell medical supplies. This means you will need warehouses and office spaces in each region you plan to operate your business. In this instance, you should open new branches in areas where you plan to store products and hire local employees to partner with regional clientele. If you wish to expand into different markets, however, then forming a subsidiary may be beneficial to your business. For example, if you're a fast fashion company but want to create a sustainable fashion line, establishing a subsidiary with entirely separate branding and business practices ensures that you can control both businesses while appealing to two different markets. One of the primary considerations when forming a subsidiary instead of opening a new branch is that each subsidiary is an independent legal entity, which means that different laws may apply to each business, and you will need to file taxes separately for each. Whether you form a subsidiary or open a new office branch, you must remember that your businesses must abide by all local tax and labor regulations in each area you plan to operate. This can become particularly complicated when expanding to foreign markets, where each country has its own, sometimes hugely different, laws. Consider partnering with a global staffing solution like Skuad as you expand your global business to ensure you're remaining compliant in each new region to which you expand.

Advantages and Disadvantages of a Branch Office Consider the following advantages and disadvantages of opening a new branch office. Advantages Opening new branch offices are less expensive than forming subsidiaries. Forming subsidiaries is expensive; opening a new branch office is typically the more cost-effective option.

Better brand recognition. Opening new branch offices ensure that your company can continue to operate in new areas under the same company name. If your company has a positive reputation, you can carry this with you to new regions and have a built-in client base. Disadvantages Puts strain on the business. When companies open a new branch, they must be prepared to handle their expanding business. Companies can get into trouble when they need more time or money to operate out of their new location effectively.

Advantages and Disadvantages of a Subsidiary Consider the following advantages and disadvantages of forming a subsidiary. Advantages Increased market share. Subsidiaries allow companies to increase market share by owning multiple subsidiaries that appeal to different clientele.

When weighing the advantages of opening a new branch office vs. forming a subsidiary, it's important to remember that there are better options than one option. Instead, you should determine which of these options better meets your business needs and weigh the pros and cons.

Freedom From Setting up Various Business Entities for Expansion As you grow your global business, compliance with all local laws and regulations poses a significant challenge. Whether you plan to open a new branch office or form a subsidiary, each region in which you expand will have unique requirements that your company must abide by. As your business expands globally, hiring employees worldwide will become necessary to ensure operations run smoothly. However, each new country where you hire an employee will require you to establish a legal entity to operate compliantly. Establishing legal entities can take several months and prove extremely expensive, with considerable hidden fees. In addition, without the help of a global employment and payroll platform like Skuad, your employees will be responsible for learning the ins and outs of local tax and employment laws. Utilizing an employer of record (EOR) bypasses the need to set up various business entities, as the EOR will act as an employer of foreign employees on your behalf. Therefore, you will not need to set up subsidiaries or branches. In addition, EOR providers like Skuad can also provide your company with regional expertise in more than 160 countries, allowing you to grow your international team in minutes.",office expansion strategy
407,Branches and Pull Requests,https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/multibranch/,,"The Multibranch Pipeline project type enables you to implement different Jenkinsfiles for different branches of the same project.

514,Building :: New Museum,https://www.newmuseum.org/building,,"The New Museum is temporarily closed to continue construction of our OMA -designed building expansion, anticipated to reopen in early 2025.

Our Next Chapter

The New Museum opened its first purpose-built home in 2007 on the Bowery at the terminus of Prince Street in New York City, designed by Pritzker Architecture Prize-winning firm SANAA / Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa. In November 2022, the New Museum broke ground on a 60,000-square-foot expansion designed by OMA / Shohei Shigematsu and Rem Koolhaas, in collaboration with Cooper Robertson, Executive Architect. This new structure will complement and be seamlessly integrated with the Museum’s SANAA-designed flagship building while doubling our exhibition space, creating new venues for artist residencies and public programs, and establishing a permanent home for our cultural incubator NEW INC. To get updates on the new building construction, sign up for our newsletter here.

New Museum Past & Future

Since our founding over forty-five years ago, the New Museum has been a site of experimentation and a hub for new art and new ideas, where risk-taking and discovery are encouraged and supported. We have always been a future-facing museum—not a place for preserving and recording history, but a place where history is made. Founded in 1977 in a temporary space on Hudson Street, the New Museum has continued to act nimbly to present art that serves as a catalyst for dialogue between contemporary artists and the public. We have expanded our footprint at key moments in the Museum’s history to better serve these goals, and this project is the latest chapter in that history.

Our new, ground-up construction will replace 231 Bowery, in which our cultural incubator NEW INC, our new media affiliate Rhizome, and artists’ residencies have been housed, and make these programs more accessible to the public. In this new building designed by OMA / Shohei Shigematsu and Rem Koolhaas, the New Museum will continue to make history.

Building Expansion

The seven-story, 60,000-square-foot building will double the Museum’s exhibition spaces. Merging with current galleries on the Second, Third, and Fourth Floors, the OMA building will align ceiling heights to achieve connectivity between the buildings with additional space dedicated to community and education programs, including a permanent home for the New Museum’s art and technology incubator NEW INC. Further cementing the New Museum’s centrality to the cultural fabric of downtown Manhattan, the OMA expansion features a new public plaza at the intersection of the Bowery and Prince Street that will host art installations, performances, and gatherings. With this vastly expanded footprint and dynamic accessibility, the new building will exponentially increase our impact.

The OMA design will improve vertical circulation for visitors with the addition of an atrium stairway, which will offer views of the surrounding neighborhood and the opportunity for innovative art installations. The stairway and new entry will align with the terminus of Prince Street, opening the Museum to the city with a visual invitation to enter and climb to the top of a world of cultural possibilities. The OMA building will also provide more public spaces and services, including an expanded lobby, a larger bookstore, an upper-level forum for education and public programs that will connect to the existing Sky Room, an artist studio, and a new eighty-seat restaurant. In addition, it will feature three additional elevators—two of which will be dedicated to gallery access—as well as more efficient organization of vital back-of-house, storage, and office space.

The façade—made from laminated glass with metal mesh—will provide a simple, unified exterior adjacent to the SANAA building by using materials that recall and complement the original façade while allowing for a higher degree of transparency. The OMA building will communicate the activities of the Museum outward, while creating an inviting presence that also draws the public inward.

Shohei Shigematsu and Rem Koolhaas are both Partners at OMA, the acclaimed architecture and urbanism practice. Recent ground-up constructions and expansions of innovative cultural spaces designed by OMA include Buffalo AKG Art Museum, NY (2023); Tiffany & Co.’s Fifth Avenue Landmark Building, NY (2023); Audrey Irmas Pavilion, Los Angeles (2022); Taipei Performing Arts Centre, Taiwan (2022); and Axel Springer Campus, Berlin (2020).

688,Building a Global Strategy for Your Business,https://www.smartling.com/resources/101/building-a-global-strategy-for-your-business/,,"No matter where in the world you live, you’ve probably experienced or heard of some of the top global brands like Apple or Amazon. Whether you’re interacting with these companies in Canada or Cambodia, your experience is more similar than it is different in terms of products, website, mobile app, and look and feel.

That’s because these companies employ a global strategy as their model for international expansion — one that prioritizes standardization across different markets.

For many companies, a global strategy is the endgame. It means you’ve “made it” because you don’t have to worry about the whims of specific market pressures or competition — you’ve grown to the point where that doesn’t matter. Here’s what a global strategy looks like in practice.

What is a global strategy?

With a global strategy, the world is your market.

Rather than approaching each country as its own market with different tastes and preferences, companies employing globalization standardize as many elements as possible, including colors, messaging, and operational models. As a result, the top global brands are instantly recognized in any country.

Take Apple, for example. They’re one of the most successful examples of a global strategy. Think about the iPhone — you may be reading this on one right now! The keyboard may be slightly different to accommodate a different language (depending on accents and alphabetical characters), but otherwise, the layout, functionality, colors, and buttons are the same no matter where you purchase in the world.

Choosing a global business strategy gives you several advantages:

A global, standardized brand that is immediately recognizable

Economies of scale deliver a more efficient process and operations

One product line with minimal changes makes it easier to streamline operations and scale faster

Competitive advantage across a global market

However, there are some trade-offs companies make by pursuing such high global integration:

Gambling on the brand equity and international appeal

Requires global footprint and recognition to be successful

Competing with local brands that already have established market share

Consumers demand transparency in supply chain and global operations

Localization and translation (don’t worry, we can help with that!)

Of all the strategic models available, a global strategy has the highest global integration and the lowest local responsiveness. This means the focus is operating with the most standardization possible and optimizing supply chain management, so there’s one brand, one suite of products, and one message from a central headquarters. There may be local offices or manufacturing sites in foreign markets, but everything rolls up to a corporate hierarchy in the domestic market that determines everything down to the size and shape of the smallest button.

But a global strategy isn’t the only answer to international expansion. In fact, it’s not the best model for everyone at every stage of growth. Most brands employing a global strategy standardize their business slowly over time after moving through one or more of these business models below:

International strategy : Usually the first type of international expansion a business undergoes, this strategy focuses on imports and exports, keeping most of their operations in their home country. Think about luxury goods like wine, caviar, or cheese as an example of this kind of business strategy — where the region of origin is a significant part of the product’s appeal in the first place.

Think about luxury goods like wine, caviar, or cheese as an example of this kind of business strategy — where the region of origin is a significant part of the product’s appeal in the first place. Multi-domestic strategy : Multi-domestic businesses take a local-first approach for every decision and use entirely different sales, marketing, and product strategies based on the specific companies they’re operating in, creating country-specific brands in a portfolio. Many food and wellness brands like Johnson & Johnson, Frito-Lay, and Nestle use this strategy.

Many food and wellness brands like Johnson & Johnson, Frito-Lay, and Nestle use this strategy. Transnational strategy: Transnational businesses coordinate local subsidiaries in international markets with one central or head office in their local market. This model is the most similar to a global strategy in that there is one overarching brand and decision-making body for strategic management but it takes a local-first approach with specific marketing, localization, and product campaigns. Companies like McDonald’s and Coca-Cola are experts at this strategy.

5 global strategy examples from top companies

A successful global strategy model focuses all of its energy on global integration, delivering one overarching brand that looks, feels, and operates cohesively regardless of the market. While not every global company is the same, many of the most successful sell products and services that have universal appeal or are easily customizable to individual users, rather than the market, like software.

Take five of the most successful multinational companies (MNC) in the world:

1. Amazon

One of the largest companies in the world, Amazon operates in 58 countries and reaches more than a billion people online every day. The leading e-commerce company in every country except China (where Alibaba is #1), you can see Amazon’s ever-present “smile” on trucks and packages — and enjoy same-day shipping — pretty much everywhere.

2. Spotify

Spotify uses a hyper-personalized approach to individual users based on their music preferences and tastes rather than across markets. While some music may not be available in every country due to licensing and legal issues, you can generally browse over 1,000 different genres from more than 1.2 million artists around the globe.

3. Disney

It’s a small world, after all. Whether you’re visiting parks in Shanghai or California, you’ll be able to experience the same magic. Disney’s team works to make sure it’s as globally inclusive as possible for movies, merchandise, and television shows, with only minor changes if needed based on audience feedback (say, for the title of a film).

4. IKEA

IKEA uses subtle tweaks based on the target market, like specific measurements, adjusting for plug types or electricity needs, and dimensions. But overall, IKEA furniture is the same Swedish engineering for small spaces that require customers to put it together themselves — and you’ll still be able to browse their large blue-and-white warehouses in every country they operate.

5. Apple

Since releasing the original Mac in 1984, Apple rose to dominance for its sleek lines, clean interface, and easy-to-use software. Globally, Apple’s technology is the same (with a few minor changes) wherever you go. Considered one of the biggest global brands today, Apple operates in over 175 countries worldwide with more than 100,000 employees.

Why you still need localization, even with a global strategy

Even though a global strategy is the least concerned with local responsiveness, that doesn’t leave you off the hook for localization. Even some of the most successful international brands still use localization and translation services.

While they may not change their product specifications, invest in market-specific imagery, or operate with local company managers or offices, global brands still provide information in multiple languages. Continuing with the Apple example, here’s a quick snapshot of their homepage, advertising the iPhone 12:

You can see from these screenshots from Apple’s home page in the United States (top) and Spain (bottom) that prices look a little different across the markets, but the message and imagery are the same.

There may be subtle differences that a global brand uses per market based on legal requirements or payment processes. Still, overall, even with Apple’s flagship product, the iPhone, their website looks and feels the same, just in a different language. You can also see that with their product pages:

English Translation Blast past fast. Más allá de la velocidad. (This loosely translates to “Beyond speed,” which is a very similar sentiment to the English copy.) New iMac. Say hello. Nouveau iMac. Dites bonjour à la couleur. (This is slightly different, but the overall messaging is very similar, almost a direct translation. The French version says, “New iMac. Say hello to color,” rather than just “Say hello,” which likely references that color has only been available recently in France. At the same time, it’s been released for several months in the United States.)

Everywhere you purchase, the colors, specifications, and information is the same. While Apple does offer different plug styles to accommodate electrical needs worldwide, an iMac is an iMac no matter where you go — including the product messaging.

406,"Business Development: Definition, Strategies, Steps, and ...",https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/090815/basics-business-development.asp,,"What Is Business Development?

Business development is the process of planning for future growth by identifying new opportunities, forming partnerships, and adding value to a company. It involves understanding the target audience, market opportunities, and effective outreach channels to drive success.

Business development may involve objectives around sales growth, business expansion, strategic partnerships, and increased profitability. The process impacts every department, including sales, marketing, manufacturing, human resources, accounting, finance, product development, and vendor management.



Key Takeaways The overarching goal of business development is to make a company more successful.

It can involve many objectives, such as sales growth, business expansion, the formation of strategic partnerships, and increased profitability.

The process impacts every department, including sales, marketing, manufacturing, human resources, accounting, finance, product development, and vendor management.

Business development leaders and team members need a diverse range of both soft and hard skills to meet these objectives.

How Business Development Works

Business development strives to increase an organization's capabilities and expand its reach to achieve financial and strategic goals. This process can significantly impact various departments within the organization, utilizing their specialized skills to drive growth.

Business development serves as the thread connecting all of a company's functions or departments. It helps a business grow and improve in areas such as sales, revenue, product offerings, talent acquisition, customer service, and brand awareness.

Business development encourages teamwork and strategic planning across all departments, ensuring the organization grows cohesively and sustainably.

Sales and Marketing

Sales personnel often concentrate on specific markets or clients, aiming to achieve targeted revenue numbers. For example, a business development team might assess the Brazilian market and determine that $1.5 billion in sales is achievable within three years. With this goal, the sales department develops strategies to target the new market's customer base.

Business development often requires a longer-term approach than traditional sales strategies. The Society for Marketing Professional Services describes sales as akin to hunting, while business development is more like farming—a long-term investment of time and energy without immediate payoff.

Marketing supports sales by promoting and advertising the company's products and services. A business development leader and their team can help set appropriate budgets based on the opportunities involved.

Higher budgets enable aggressive strategies like cold calling, personal visits, roadshows, and free sample distribution. Lower budgets tend to focus on more passive strategies, such as online, print, and social media ads, as well as billboard advertising.

Legal and Finance

To enter a new market, a business development team must decide whether to go solo by navigating all required legal formalities or to form a strategic alliance or partnership with firms already operating in that market. Assisted by legal and finance teams, the business development group weighs the pros and cons of each option and chooses the one that best serves the business.

Finance may also become involved in cost-cutting initiatives. Business development is not just about increasing market reach and sales, but also about improving the bottom line.

For example, suppose an internal assessment reveals high spending on corporate business travel. In that case, the team may change travel policies such as hosting video conference calls instead of on-site meetings or opting for less expensive transportation modes. The outsourcing of non-core work, such as billing, technology operations, or customer service, may also be part of a development plan.

Project Management/Business Planning

International business expansion involves critical decisions about whether to establish a new facility in the target market or manufacture products in the base country and import them. If opting for the latter, it may also require assessing the need for an additional facility in the base country.

The business development team evaluates and finalizes such decisions based on cost and time assessments. Once a decision is made, the project management and implementation team can begin working on the desired goal.

Product Management and Manufacturing

Regulatory standards and market requirements can vary across regions and countries. For example, a medication permitted in India may not be allowed in the United Kingdom. This can necessitate a customized or entirely new product for the new market.

Almost all countries require specific documentation and have regulations that must be met to ensure the safety, quality, and conformity of imported products.

These requirements drive the work of product management and manufacturing departments, which are influenced by the business strategy. Cost considerations, legal approvals, and regulatory compliance are all critical aspects assessed during the development process.

Vendor Management

Will the new business need external vendors? For example, will shipping require a dedicated courier service, or will the company partner with an established retail chain for sales? What are the costs associated with these partnerships?

The business development team collaborates with relevant internal departments to address these questions and determine the best strategies for external engagements.



10 Potential Areas for Business Development

Business development often requires employees from various departments to collaborate, facilitating information flow, strategic planning, and informed decision-making. Here is a summary of potential areas where business development may be involved, depending on the organization:

Market research and analysis: Identifying new market opportunities and developing effective strategies Sales and lead generation: Prospecting, qualifying leads, and coordinating with the sales team to convert leads into customers Strategic partnerships and alliances: Forming strategic alliances, joint ventures, or collaborations that create mutually beneficial opportunities Product development and innovation: Conducting market research, gathering customer feedback, and collaborating with internal teams to drive innovation Customer relationship management: Implementing customer retention initiatives, loyalty programs, and gathering customer feedback to enhance satisfaction and drive repeat business. Strategic planning and business modeling: Identifying growth opportunities, setting targets, and implementing strategies to achieve sustainable growth. Mergers and acquisitions: Evaluating potential synergies, conducting due diligence, and negotiating and executing deals. Brand management and marketing: Creating effective marketing campaigns, managing online and offline channels, and leveraging digital marketing techniques. Financial analysis and funding: Exploring funding options, securing investments, or identifying grant opportunities. Innovation and emerging technologies: Assessing the potential impact of disruptive technologies and integrating them into the organization's growth strategies.

The Business Development Process in 6 Steps

While the specific steps in the business development process will depend on the particular company, its needs and capabilities, its leadership, and its available capital, some common steps include:

Step 1: Market Research/Analysis

Begin by conducting comprehensive market research to gain insights into market trends, customer needs, and the competitive landscape. Analyze data and gather additional information to identify potential growth opportunities and understand market dynamics.

Step 2: Establish Clear Goals and Objectives

Leveraging that research, define specific objectives and goals for business development efforts. These goals could include revenue targets, market expansion goals, customer acquisition targets, and product or service development. Setting clear goals provides a focus and direction for the business development process.

Step 3: Generate and Qualify Leads

Use various sources, such as industry databases, networking, referrals, or online platforms, to generate a pool of potential leads. Identify individuals or companies that fit the target market criteria and evaluate them based on predetermined criteria to determine their suitability and potential value.

Step 4: Build Relationships and Present Solutions

Initiate contact with qualified leads and establish relationships through effective communication and engagement. Utilize networking events, industry conferences, personalized emails, or social media interactions to build trust and credibility.

As your relationship forms, develop and present tailored solutions that align with the client's needs. Demonstrate the value proposition of the organization's offerings and highlight key benefits and competitive advantages.

Step 5: Negotiate and Expand

Prepare and deliver proposals that outline the scope of work, pricing, deliverables, and timelines. Once the client agrees, collaborate with legal and other relevant internal teams to finalize and execute the contract to ensure all terms are clear and agreed upon. Maintain communication with the client throughout this process to address any questions or concerns.

Step 6: Continuously Evaluate

Continuously monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of business development efforts. Analyze performance metrics, gather feedback from clients and internal stakeholders, and identify areas for improvement. Regularly refine strategies and processes to adapt to market changes and optimize outcomes.

While it's common for startup companies to seek outside assistance in developing the business, as a company matures, it should aim to build its business development expertise internally.

How to Create a Business Development Plan

To effectively create and implement a business development plan, the team needs to set clear objectives and goals—ones that are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). You can align these objectives with the overall business goals of the company.

Companies often start by analyzing their current state through a SWOT analysis, evaluating their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. This helps identify target markets and customer segments and define a unique value proposition.

The external-facing stages of a business development plan are crucial. These stages should outline sales and marketing strategies to generate leads and convert them into customers. They should also explore potential strategic partnerships and alliances to expand reach, access new markets, or enhance offerings.

Teams should also conduct a financial analysis and resource planning to determine the resources needed for implementing the plan. Once implemented, progress should be tracked against the key performance indicators (KPIs) you've chosen to ensure the plan's effectiveness.

Skills Needed for Business Development Jobs

Business development requires a wide range of hard and soft skills.



Leaders and team members in business development need well-honed sales and negotiation skills to interact with clients, understand their needs, and influence their decisions. They must build rapport, handle challenges, and close deals. Effective communication, both verbal and written, with customers and internal stakeholders, is crucial.

Business development specialists should be thoroughly aware of the market in which they operate and keep up with market dynamics, competitive activities, and industry developments. They need to identify potential opportunities, make informed decisions, and adjust strategies as necessary, requiring strong analytical skills.

Internally, business development practitioners must clarify priorities, set realistic deadlines, manage resources efficiently, and monitor progress to guarantee the timely completion of tasks.

Finally, business development professionals should conduct themselves with high ethical standards. They must maintain confidentiality, act legally and ethically, and build trust with customers and stakeholders.

Why Is Business Development Important? In addition to its benefits to individual companies, business development is important for generating jobs, developing key industries, and keeping the economy moving forward.

What Are the Most Important Skills for Business Development Executives? Development executives need to have leadership skills, vision, drive, and a willingness to work with a variety of people to get to a common goal.

How Can I Be Successful in Business Development? Having a vision and putting together a good team are among the factors that help predict success in business development. A successful developer also knows how to write a good business plan, which becomes the blueprint to build from.

What, in Brief, Should a Business Development Plan Include? A business development plan, or business plan, should describe the organization's objectives and how it intends to achieve them, including financial goals, expected costs, and targeted milestones.

The Bottom Line

Business development is key to companies' growth and achievement of their goals. It involves setting clear objectives, leveraging market research, forming strategic partnerships, and aligning efforts across all departments to drive success.

A well-executed business development plan not only supports short-term revenue growth but also ensures long-term sustainability. As companies across various industries increasingly recognize its importance, the role of business development continues to grow.",planning to open new branch

262,Business Office Relocation? 7 Tips For A Perfect IT Move,https://www.drlogic.com/article/relocation-relocation-relocation-our-7-tips-for-a-perfect-it-move/,,"Moving office, just like moving home, should be exciting. It’s not just a change of scene, but a whole new chapter for your business: an opportunity to grow and explore new horizons. But all too often, office moves are fraught with stress. However well you’ve planned it out, you always worry there’s something vital you’ve forgotten – stuff you were meant to check, to order, to take with you or leave behind.

And that’s especially true when you’re moving your technology. Because although IT is the least visible part of your office, that intricate network of servers, routers, switches and cables – not to mention all your office devices and peripherals – is the backbone of your business. So if everything isn’t set up perfectly from day one, it’s going to slow you down, frustrate your teams and ruin what should be an exciting day for your business.

That’s why it’s vital to develop a really detailed, well-thought-out moving plan, and carry it out to the letter. But where should you begin?

Here are our top 7 tips to plan the perfect IT move.

1. Give yourself enough time

It’s easy to underestimate how long a move takes. Because while transporting hardware can be relatively fast, the necessary research and planning takes an awful lot longer.

This is because you’ll need to agree exactly what technology you need and where it’s all going to go. And also because your schedule needs to fit with that of your technology partners: it takes time, for example, to get new equipment delivered and to get a new internet service set up.

Make sure to contact all your vendors and carriers at least two months in advance, so they’re aware of your move date.

2. Take a good look at your IT equipment

An office move is the perfect time to replace or update any ageing IT hardware. Take a full inventory of the equipment you’re using at the moment, to check if it’s still meeting your needs and if it’s going to work in your new office.

Get rid of anything that’s broken or outdated and return any leased hardware you longer need. It’s also worth thinking about simplifying your IT set-up, by moving some of your systems to the cloud. Getting rid of on-site servers will free up space in your new office, and help to create a more streamlined and efficient system.

3. Think about communication and connectivity

What kind of communications set-up will you need in your new office – both now and over the next few years?

Power and Data points – How many phone lines are you likely to need?

How many power outlets? Are they in the right place? i.e. the server room or next to where you want to locate printers etc?

Cabling – Work out if your new office already has the cabling and infrastructure you need, or if anything needs to be changed. For example, check that the office already has “structured cabling” as not everything runs off wifi and you don’t want lots of ethernet cables trailing everywhere. If there is no structured cabling, you have to factor that in to your costs. Most IT companies will have a technician they know and trust for structured cabling, so ask them for tips.

Phones – Now could be the time to move to an internet-based phone system – where your staff won’t need to even be in the new office to take calls that go through to their desk.

Internet – And the same goes for your internet connection; find the office on www.bt.com and check the broadband availability in the area. Don’t assume every office has an internet connection because if they don’t getting it connect can be a long and difficult process. If the office already has broadband piped in are you happy with the current speeds, or could your broadband benefit from an upgrade?

It may be worth talking to your internet service provider to check your options, since they often offer low-cost introductory rates and deals. Also bear in mind it’s much quicker for a company that provided internet for the last tenants to switch it over to new tenants, rather than going with a new company that has to do it all from scratch.

4. Do a thorough recon

A detailed inspection of your new office is an essential part of planning a successful move. Understand where you’re moving to:

Are you moving to a new office only for you and your company, you need to figure out who is going to provide you with internet and get them on the case from step one (BT, Virgin, etc). And don’t assume all providers go to all offices.

Then consider how you’re going to get the internet connection to all of your devices:

Are you moving into a bigger space?

Will you need more switches and more wifi points?

Are you planning on using 4G or using mobile phones for calls?

Run an online check to find out the 4G Data and availability.

Or are you moving into a communal workspace?

Communal workspaces (Workspace, WeWork etc) usually have an IT team managing their infrastructure, and they will be able to provide you with most of what you need. Wifi Name, VPN availability, Printing will all need to be discussed with that team. If you have a server you need to move over, again, you need to discuss this with the office IT team you’re moving to.

Sometimes it’s a good idea to have your IT and/or internet service provider join you, to check everything’s working and flag up any changes you need to make. Think about the best place to put every element of your network, from routers and cabling points, to workstations and printers. And look out for any potential WiFi blackspots: some walls, for example, can block the signal, and may need to be changed. Make sure to record all your decisions on a scale floorplan of the space.

5. Keep your data safe

In business, it’s always wise to plan for worst-case scenarios. And they don’t come much worse than losing vital data during an office move. What would happen, for example, if your equipment somehow got damaged – if something important was dropped, or your moving truck was involved in an accident?

That’s why you need to make several backup copies of all your data systems, including firewalls and servers. Store the copies where they can’t be affected by the move, and make sure there’s also one at your new office, in case anything goes wrong on the day.

Cloud solutions – This would be the ideal opportunity to migrate your data to a cloud-based solution – taking away the worry that the above accidents may happen.

6. Get expert help for the move

Transporting IT equipment isn’t easy. It takes special handling, expertise, and protection. And that’s not something a regular moving company is likely to have.

Don’t forget – be explicit. If you tell someone you want them to move the server, they will move the physical server. If you actually meant you want them to move the Server, the cabinet the server is in, all the peripherals connected to the server and all of the other equipment inside the server rack – it’s a different conversation.

So we recommend getting your IT provider to take care of that part of the move. As well as moving your electronic equipment safely, they’ll have the expertise to ensure that everything’s labelled correctly – both what it is, and where it fits in your set-up. And if necessary, they can show your staff how to shut down their equipment properly the day before the move, and safely disconnect it.

Insurance – Check your company insurance and make sure it covers your equipment in transit. You’ll also want to update it to show your new business premises as this may change your premiums and will invalidate your insurance if not updated.

You’ll also want to check that the moving company have insurance with a high enough indemnity for the value of your equipment. Your mate from the pub, although cheap and willing, could be the worst decision you ever made.

7. Test your new network

There’s nothing worse than having staff come into the office after a move, only to find that nothing’s working. That’s why we recommend getting your IT provider to check in advance that everything’s working and in the right place.

Do you have external backups? Is your server still communicating with the external backup? And is your data being backed up? Often this is forgotten until a backup is needed, and if the server hasn’t been able to connect to the backup server, you’re in a bad position.

Depending on how much new equipment you’re using, you may even be able to get your new office up and running ahead of the move. Either way, it’s a good idea to also have your IT provider in the office the day after a move, to fix any issues and answer any questions your staff have. There will often be gremlins and some members of staff who have unforeseen IT issues after the move so having your IT support company on hand is vital.

We hope you found these tips helpful, but if you’d like to find out more – or if you’re looking for help with your own office IT move – just get in touch.

A business plan is a document that details a company's goals and how it intends to achieve them. Business plans can be of benefit to both startups and well-established companies. For startups, a business plan can be essential for winning over potential lenders and investors. Established businesses can find one useful for staying on track and not losing sight of their goals. This article explains what an effective business plan needs to include and how to write one.

Key Takeaways A business plan is a document describing a company's business activities and how it plans to achieve its goals.

Startup companies use business plans to get off the ground and attract outside investors.

For established companies, a business plan can help keep the executive team focused on and working toward the company's short- and long-term objectives.

There is no single format that a business plan must follow, but there are certain key elements that most companies will want to include.

Investopedia / Ryan Oakley

Understanding Business Plans

Any new business should have a business plan in place prior to beginning operations. In fact, banks and venture capital firms often want to see a business plan before they'll consider making a loan or providing capital to new businesses.

Even if a business isn't looking to raise additional money, a business plan can help it focus on its goals. A 2017 Harvard Business Review article reported that, ""Entrepreneurs who write formal plans are 16% more likely to achieve viability than the otherwise identical nonplanning entrepreneurs.""

Ideally, a business plan should be reviewed and updated periodically to reflect any goals that have been achieved or that may have changed. An established business that has decided to move in a new direction might create an entirely new business plan for itself.

There are numerous benefits to creating (and sticking to) a well-conceived business plan. These include being able to think through ideas before investing too much money in them and highlighting any potential obstacles to success. A company might also share its business plan with trusted outsiders to get their objective feedback. In addition, a business plan can help keep a company's executive team on the same page about strategic action items and priorities.

Business plans, even among competitors in the same industry, are rarely identical. However, they often have some of the same basic elements, as we describe below.

While it's a good idea to provide as much detail as necessary, it's also important that a business plan be concise enough to hold a reader's attention to the end.

How to Write a Business Plan

While there are any number of templates that you can use to write a business plan, it's best to try to avoid producing a generic-looking one. Let your plan reflect the unique personality of your business.

Many business plans use some combination of the sections below, with varying levels of detail, depending on the company.

Common Elements of a Business Plan

The length of a business plan can vary greatly from business to business. Regardless, it's best to fit the basic information into a 15- to 25-page document. Other crucial elements that take up a lot of space—such as applications for patents—can be referenced in the main document and attached as appendices.

These are some of the most common elements in many business plans:

Executive summary: This section introduces the company and includes its mission statement along with relevant information about the company's leadership, employees, operations, and locations.

This section introduces the company and includes its mission statement along with relevant information about the company's leadership, employees, operations, and locations. Products and services: Here, the company should describe the products and services it offers or plans to introduce. That might include details on pricing, product lifespan, and unique benefits to the consumer. Other factors that could go into this section include production and manufacturing processes, any relevant patents the company may have, as well as proprietary technology. Information about research and development (R&D) can also be included here.

This section should explain where the company fits in, what types of customers it plans to target, and how easy or difficult it may be to take market share from incumbents.

It should also describe the distribution channel or channels it will use to get its products or services to consumers.

Financial plans and projections: Established businesses can include financial statements, balance sheets, and other relevant financial information. New businesses can provide financial targets and estimates for the first few years. Your plan might also include any funding requests you're making.

Tip The best business plans aren't generic ones created from easily accessed templates. A company should aim to entice readers with a plan that demonstrates its uniqueness and potential for success.

2 Types of Business Plans

Business plans can take many forms, but they are sometimes divided into two basic categories: traditional and lean startup. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), the traditional business plan is the more common of the two.

Traditional business plans : These plans tend to be much longer than lean startup plans and contain considerably more detail. As a result they require more work on the part of the business, but they can also be more persuasive (and reassuring) to potential investors.

: These plans tend to be much longer than lean startup plans and contain considerably more detail. As a result they require more work on the part of the business, but they can also be more persuasive (and reassuring) to potential investors. Lean startup business plans: These use an abbreviated structure that highlights key elements. These business plans are short—as short as one page—and provide only the most basic detail. If a company wants to use this kind of plan, it should be prepared to provide more detail if an investor or a lender requests it.

Why Do Business Plans Fail? A business plan is not a surefire recipe for success. The plan may have been unrealistic in its assumptions and projections to begin with. Markets and the overall economy might change in ways that couldn't have been foreseen. A competitor might introduce a revolutionary new product or service. All of this calls for building some flexibility into your plan, so you can pivot to a new course if needed.



How Often Should a Business Plan Be Updated? How frequently a business plan needs to be revised will depend on the nature of the business. A well-established business might want to review its plan once a year and make changes if necessary. A new or fast-growing business in a fiercely competitive market might want to revise it more often, such as quarterly.

What Does a Lean Startup Business Plan Include? The lean startup business plan is an option when a company prefers to give a quick explanation of its business. For example, a brand-new company may feel that it doesn't have a lot of information to provide yet. Sections can include: a value proposition; the company's major activities and advantages; resources such as staff, intellectual property, and capital; a list of partnerships; customer segments; and revenue sources.

The Bottom Line

A business plan can be useful to companies of all kinds. But as a company grows and the world around it changes, so too should its business plan. So don't think of your business plan as carved in granite but as a living document designed to evolve with your business.",planning office expansion
202,Business Recruitment and Expansion,https://business.utah.gov/business-recruitment/,,"Whether growing from within or recruiting targeted industry firms, Utah’s economy continues to lead the nation with its business-friendly environment.

The office’s Business Recruitment and Expansion team recommends financial incentives for local and out-of-state companies seeking to expand or relocate to Utah.

386,CFPB Proposes to Ban Medical Bills from Credit Reports,https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-proposes-to-ban-medical-bills-from-credit-reports/,3 дня назад,"WASHINGTON, D.C. - The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) today proposed a rule that would remove medical bills from most credit reports, increase privacy protections, help to increase credit scores and loan approvals, and prevent debt collectors from using the credit reporting system to coerce people to pay. The proposal would stop credit reporting companies from sharing medical debts with lenders and prohibit lenders from making lending decisions based on medical information. The proposed rule is part of the CFPB’s efforts to address the burden of medical debt and coercive credit reporting practices.

""The CFPB is seeking to end the senseless practice of weaponizing the credit reporting system to coerce patients into paying medical bills that they do not owe,” said CFPB Director Rohit Chopra. ""Medical bills on credit reports too often are inaccurate and have little to no predictive value when it comes to repaying other loans.""

In 2003, Congress restricted lenders from obtaining or using medical information, including information about debts, through the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. However, federal agencies subsequently issued a special regulatory exception to allow creditors to use medical debts in their credit decisions.

The CFPB is proposing to close the regulatory loophole that has kept vast amounts of medical debt information in the credit reporting system. The proposed rule would help ensure that medical information does not unjustly damage credit scores, and would help keep debt collectors from coercing payments for inaccurate or false medical bills.

The CFPB’s research reveals that a medical bill on a person’s credit report is not a good predicter of whether they will repay a loan. In fact, the CFPB’s analysis shows that medical debts penalize consumers by making underwriting decisions less accurate and leading to thousands of denied applications on mortgages that consumers would repay. Since these are loans people will repay, the CFPB expects lenders will also benefit from improved underwriting and increased volume of safe loan approvals. In terms of mortgages, the CFPB expects the proposed rule would lead to the approval of approximately 22,000 additional, safe mortgages every year.

In December 2014, the CFPB released a report showing that medical debts provide less predictive value to lenders than other debts on credit reports. Then in March 2022, the CFPB released a report estimating that medical bills made up $88 billion of reported debts on credit reports. In that report, the CFPB announced that it would assess whether credit reports should include data on unpaid medical bills.

Since the March 2022 report, the three nationwide credit reporting conglomerates – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion – announced that they would take many of those bills off credit reports, and FICO and VantageScore, the two major credit scoring companies, have decreased the degree to which medical bills impact a consumer’s score.

Despite these voluntary industry changes, 15 million Americans still have $49 billion in outstanding medical bills in collections appearing in the credit reporting system. The complex nature of medical billing, insurance coverage and reimbursement, and collections means that medical debts that continue to be reported are often inaccurate or inflated. Additionally, the changes by FICO and VantageScore have not eliminated the credit score difference between people with and without medical debt on their credit reports. We expect that Americans with medical debt on their credit reports will see their credit scores rise by 20 points, on average, if today’s proposed rule is finalized.

Under the current system, debt collectors improperly use the credit reporting system to coerce people to pay debts they may not owe. Many debt collectors engage in a practice known as “debt parking,” where they purchase medical debt then place it on credit reports, often without the consumer’s knowledge. When consumers apply for credit, they may discover that a medical bill is hindering their ability to get a loan. Consumers may then feel forced to pay the medical bill in order to improve their credit score and be approved for a loan, regardless of the debt’s validity.

Specifically, the proposed rule, if finalized would:

Eliminate the special medical debt exception: The proposed rule would remove the exception that broadly permits lenders to obtain and use information about medical debt to make credit eligibility determinations. Lenders would continue to be able to consider medical information related to disability income and similar benefits, as well as medical information relevant to the purpose of the loan, so long as certain conditions are met.

The proposed rule would remove the exception that broadly permits lenders to obtain and use information about medical debt to make credit eligibility determinations. Lenders would continue to be able to consider medical information related to disability income and similar benefits, as well as medical information relevant to the purpose of the loan, so long as certain conditions are met. Establish guardrails for credit reporting companies: The proposed rule would prohibit credit reporting companies from including medical debt on credit reports sent to creditors when creditors are prohibited from considering it.

The proposed rule would prohibit credit reporting companies from including medical debt on credit reports sent to creditors when creditors are prohibited from considering it. Ban repossession of medical devices: The proposed rule would prohibit lenders from taking medical devices as collateral for a loan, and bans lenders from repossessing medical devices, like wheelchairs or prosthetic limbs, if people are unable to repay the loan.

The CFPB began today’s rulemaking in September 2023 with the goals of ending coercive debt collection practices and limiting the role of medical debt in the credit reporting system. The CFPB additionally published in 2022 a report describing the extensive and debilitating effects of medical debt along with a bulletin on the No Surprises Act to remind credit reporting companies and debt collectors of their legal responsibilities under that legislation.

(WSMV) – A California-based manufacturing company will move its operations to Williamson County, officials announced Tuesday.

Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee, Department of Economic and Community Development Commissioner Stuart C. McWhorter and Lazestar, Inc. officials announced the company will invest $5.5 million to relocate its operations from Livermore, California, to Fairview, Tennessee.

The move will create 25 new jobs in Williamson County. Lazestar’s expansion and relocation stem from continued growth and help the company better serve its customers. Lazestar specializes in fabrication and laser welding components used in the defense, aerospace, microwave, biomedical and commercial industries, according to a media release from the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development (TNECD).

“I welcome Lazestar to Tennessee and thank them for their commitment to creating new, highly skilled jobs for the dedicated workforce across Williamson County,” Gov. Bill Lee said. “We look forward to the positive impact Lazestar will bring to this region in the years to come.”

TNECD Commissioner Stuart C. McWhorter said Williamson County landed the most new projects in all of Tennessee’s 95 counties last year, and he’s excited about the addition of Lazestar.

“I thank Lazestar for choosing Fairview to relocate its operations, and I know this company will bring additional training and skillsets to the workforce here,” he said.

Lazestar, Inc. CEO Michael Hartman, said he chose Tennessee to relocate his business because the state supports its businesses.

And agents promoting the remarkable new eight-storey building in Ebley St say it’s buildings such as this that will be key to encouraging workers back into the office after Covid.

The famous architect Rosselli said: “Luigi Rosselli Architects relished the opportunity offered by an open-minded and adventurous developer to … bring Sydney’s Eastern Suburbs a commercial development of a quality one might expect to find in Silicon Valley, Milan or in the city finge to the west of Sydney’s CBD.”

Agents pitching developer Lords Group’s project to tenants, Colliers International and Richardson and Wrench Commercial Eastern Suburbs, describe it as Bondi Junction’s first premium office development in more than a decade.

“The only A-Grade new build within the suburb, Verdical will offer a plethora of exciting features for tenants across eight levels, including an exclusive rooftop terrace, an activated lobby with on-site café and premium end-of-trip facilities all while being located in one of the most desirable locations in Sydney,” Justin Rosenberg of Colliers says.

“Offering entire floors, ranging from 484sqm to 786sqm, Verdical is a blank canvas for your business and imagination.

“With endless possibilities, occupiers have the opportunity to set the new standard

for workplace design.”

Verdical is due for completion in the first quarter of 2025.

Rosenberg shares the listing with his colleague, Jake Jamieson, in conjunction with Victor Negrine and Angus Morrison of R&W.

Jamieson says if this building doesn’t encourage workers back into the office, nothing will.

“It’s all about creating a destination for employees that fosters not only ideal working conditions, but a lifestyle they can enjoy,” he said.

“Verdical’s close proximity to amenities and transportation will redefine your expectations of the workplace, with the Sydney CBD and all the drawcards of the east right on your doorstep.

“Verdical will reshape the Bondi Junction office market, define a new level of luxury and provide amenities not previously seen in the Eastern Suburbs office market.

Negrine said: “As the only true premium office building in Bondi Junction we are expecting to see strong interest from businesses looking to have a premium location in a sought-after area with all amenities at their door step.”

One tenant has already been secured in the building, with Soak Bathhouse occupying

the 634sqm ground floor.

With a focus on the art of relaxation and wellness for mind body and spirit, facilities include mineral baths, hot spas, plunge pools, a steam room and sauna.

Meanwhile in other Bondi Junction commercial news, Colliers sold an apartment block at 2 Hollywood Ave for $10.85m on Tuesday night. They had four bidders fighting over it at Damien Cooley’s Double Bay auction rooms.

With a duration of eight weeks and covering an area of 500 square meters, the project aimed to seamlessly integrate a new office space into its existing layout on Level 3.

The project scope encompassed several crucial elements, including the installation of new workstations, creation of two POD meeting rooms, establishment of three meeting rooms with AV equipment, provision of new lockers and joinery throughout the space, floor replacement, relocation of existing kitchen joinery, installation of new reception joinery, and necessary service alterations to accommodate the new layout.

One of the primary challenges faced during the project was maintaining operations in a live environment. As Charter Hall continued its business activities throughout the construction phase, strict adherence to noise restrictions, implementation of out-of-hours works, and ensuring shared access ways and passenger lifts remained accessible were paramount. Moreover, maintaining cleanliness and tidiness throughout the construction process was crucial to minimise disruptions to ongoing operations.

Another challenge was the relocation of the existing kitchen and a large stone bench, measuring approximately nine meters in length and featuring a unique stone benchtop. To accomplish this feat without compromising the integrity of the stone bench, a meticulous methodology was devised. Coordination meetings were held to strategise the relocation process, ensuring minimal disruption and preserving the aesthetic appeal of the feature stone bench.

Despite these challenges, the team successfully navigated through its complexities, thanks to effective coordination management of client contractors and leveraging a previous working relationship with the stakeholder group.

By John Weigand

Miami University professor and architect

It took a global pandemic to convince American businesses that their employees could work productively from home, or a favorite coffee shop.

Post-COVID-19, employers are struggling to find the right balance of in-office and remote work. However, hybrid work is likely here to stay, at least for a segment of workers.

This shift isn’t just changing lifestyles – it’s also affecting commercial spaces. Office vacancy rates post-COVID-19 shot up almost overnight, and they remain near 20% nationwide, the highest rate since 1979 as tenants downsize in place or relocate. This workspace surplus is putting pressure on existing development loans and leading to defaults or creative refinancing in a market already plagued by higher interest rates.

Office tenants with deeper pockets have gravitated to newer and larger buildings with more amenities, often referred to as Class A or “trophy” buildings. Older Class B and C buildings, which often have fewer amenities or less-desirable locations, have struggled to fill space.

High vacancy rates are forcing developers to get creative. With reduced demand for older buildings, along with housing shortages in many American cities, some downtown buildings are being converted to residential use.

These projects often include some percentage of affordable housing, underwritten by tax incentives. In October 2023, the Biden administration released a list of federal loan, grant, tax credit and technical assistance programs that can support commercial-to-residential conversions.

Renovations of older commercial buildings are becoming more economical and sustainable than new construction and are fundamentally changing the character of cities. Even though only about 20% to 30% of older buildings can be profitably converted, architects and developers are quickly learning how to grade these structures to identify good candidates.

From workplace to living space

Converting commercial buildings to apartments didn’t start with the pandemic. In the decade leading up to the outbreak of COVID-19, developers converted more than 110,000 apartments from outdated hotels, office buildings, factories, warehouses and other buildings across the U.S. According to industry data, more than 58,000 apartments are currently being converted from office buildings.

Several characteristics of older Class B and C buildings make conversion particularly attractive. These buildings typically have smaller floor plates – total square footage of space per floor. Importantly, they also have shorter “core-to-shell” distances – the distance from the building core that contains stairs and elevators to the window wall.

Residential building codes generally require that natural light reach most rooms. Since living spaces, bedrooms and bathrooms are often separated by walls, a smaller core-to-shell distance allows more rooms to access natural light, making the conversion easier.

In contrast, typical new office buildings have larger floor plates and core-to-shell distances that sometimes can exceed 50 feet. This makes them more difficult to convert to residences.

But it’s not impossible. One creative solution involves moving the window wall inward by several feet to create outdoor decks. That’s an appealing amenity, but also an extra cost. In some conversions where the core-to-shell depth is greater than needed, developers have added interior vertical shafts or window wells to bring daylight to interior spaces.

Many older commercial buildings also offer higher ceilings, which are especially desirable in the residential market. Apartments and condos typically don’t need to conceal mechanical and electrical services with suspended acoustic tile ceilings, as offices do, so they can provide 12 feet or more of clear ceiling height.

Some older buildings, including many made of brick or stone, have large windows, which also are desirable in residential use. Conversely, smaller windows or higher sill heights may be disincentives to conversion.

Many older buildings were constructed before air conditioning was widely available, so they have operable windows. This is yet another plus for residential conversion, since occupants typically desire natural ventilation in their dwelling unit.

Obstacles to conversion

Some characteristics of older buildings can make residential conversion more difficult. For example, location always matters. Buildings that are far from other amenities, such as restaurants or grocery stores, may be less desirable.

Buildings with more unusual floor plates or geometric forms that work for office use may be difficult to carve up into residential units. Older structures that contain asbestos or lead paint can require expensive remediation.

Zoning laws may bar residential use or otherwise limit what can be done with a building. Cities can play an important role in encouraging residential conversions by revisiting zoning codes or offering tax incentives to developers.

One of the biggest costs of a residential conversion is the need to replace building systems such as plumbing and heating. Plumbing requirements in commercial office spaces, for example, are largely met with restroom facilities in the building core. Apartments or condos each require their own bathroom and kitchen, adding significant cost.

A return to ‘walkable cities’

Despite these challenges, if residential conversions bring people and energy back to downtowns outside of the workday, stores, restaurants, entertainment and other amenities of a vibrant lifestyle will follow.

Architects, planners, developers and politicians are increasingly interested in “walkable cities” or “20-minute cities.” Both of these concepts allude to providing necessary amenities like grocery stores, schools and restaurants that are accessible to residents on foot, reducing the need to own a car and promoting a more sustainable lifestyle.

Walkable cities aren’t a new idea. Throughout the 19th century, people in U.S. cities like New York and Chicago lived, worked, shopped and socialized within mixed-use neighborhoods.

The growth of car ownership post-World War II separated these uses into residential suburbs, office parks, shopping malls and cineplexes. Many critics view suburbanization as a failed experiment that has promoted sprawling development, reliance on cars and economic inequality

As more downtown office buildings are converted to residential use, many of them are likely to house restaurants, day care facilities, grocery stores and other service businesses, typically on their ground floors. These amenities contribute to the financial success of a project and to the vibrant lifestyles of its residents.

All of these shifts prompt questions. Can architects and developers find ways to design buildings that serve multiple uses over several centuries, rather than a single targeted use that becomes obsolete in 100 years? Can mid- and high-rise buildings be envisioned as flexible structural grids, with lower-cost and easily changeable modular inserts? Such structures could accommodate ever-changing needs, some of which we may not yet know will be critical to the urban infrastructure.

Architects, planners and developers are beginning to explore these questions.",announced new office plans

Phog owner Tom Lucier said, after 20 years operating the venue, soaring rent was to blame.

“I understand rents go up,” he told AM800’s The Dan MacDonald Show on Monday. “My rent went up like 13 per cent, but my friends at Craft Heads, their rent went up like 300 per cent.”

“It's untenable. That kind of rent increase is psychotic,” said Lucier.

It was ownership at Craft Heads, Lucier said, that let him know they were renting space in a newer plaza on Erie Street – next to Nizam Pastry.

When he looked into the location, he found the space right next door was available. That’s where Phog will set up.

Jason Barsotta, co-owner of Craft Heads, told CTV News their brewery has already relocated to the new spot, but the bar portion of the business is staying downtown for now.

“We did sign a two year lease with the landlords at the increased rate for just the taproom,” said Barsotta. “So we're trying to sort some things out right now.”

He said staff at the taproom are excited to keep serving folks at their usual University Avenue West and Pelissier Street spot.

For Phog, Lucier also said the lease at both spaces would overlap – he plans to operate both bars simultaneously for a period.

“I'm going to have basically two Phog Lounges for about five months,” he said. “And if I get a reasonable response from where I am now, I'll stay in the spot I'm in now and I'll run two of them. But that isn't what's going to happen.”

On Erie Street, the pair of nightlife pillars will be in good company – sharing a city block with WindsorEats.

Founder and Co-owner Adriano Ciotoli said he’s excited.

“For two and a half years we’ve been doing our own little thing with no one really around us, but to have these two businesses – who we’ve worked with in the past – coming in, the possibilities are endless,” he told CTV News.

Ciotoli said he expects the two businesses to open within the next few months.

“I’m someone who’s super stoked to move into this next process,” Lucier said. “What if this new incarnation of the business is 10 times better?”",plans to relocate headquarters

GREEN COVE SPRINGS, Fla. – The Clay County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) on Monday announced a potential $7 million plan to issue body-worn cameras to all its deputies over the next five years.

Clay County is the last of the major sheriff’s offices in the area to implement body cameras.

Clay County Sheriff Michelle Cook said in a news release the plan shows her commitment to “enhancing transparency, accountability, and safety within law enforcement operations” because body cameras “serve as a crucial tool in promoting trust and confidence in the criminal justice system.”

CCSO said it is set to initiate the testing and evaluation of body-worn camera technology, with full implementation following the evaluation phase. An exact timeline of when they will be put in place was not released.

Cook said CCSO is partnering with potential vendors to conduct comprehensive testing of both hardware and software solutions. The approach aims to identify the most cost-efficient and beneficial option for the agency and the citizens of the county, CCSO said.

“Our decision to implement body-worn cameras underscores our unwavering commitment to fostering transparency, accountability, and safety within our communities, while also increasing the safety of our deputies,” stated Sheriff Michelle Cook. “We recognize that this represents a significant investment of capital, and thus, we are taking a deliberate and systematic approach to ensure that we select the most effective solution for our agency and our community.

Governor Kay Ivey highlighted the company’s track record of growth and praised its unwavering commitment to Alabama.

“As we stand on this site today, it’s important to recognize Coca-Cola’s journey here in Alabama – with what began as a mule-drawn wagon to this upcoming state-of-the-art facility,” Governor Ivey said. “This new campus will create jobs and secure existing ones, further boosting our economy.

“It is through strong relationships that we have reached this defining moment, and I am proud that the community here has made it easy for Coca-Cola United to continue to call Birmingham their home,” she added.

The governor concluded her remarks at the groundbreaking ceremony with a call to action.

“Now, let’s celebrate by getting some dirt tossed and some Cokes drank,” she said.

‘UNFORGETTABLE GATEWAY’

Touted as a gateway to Birmingham, the new facility will sit on the former Stockham Valves and Fittings site on 40th Street North and will be highly visible to passing motorists along Interstate 20/59.

The new facility will house the Birmingham Coca-Cola sales center and warehouse, as well as Coca-Cola UNITED’s Corporate, Central Region and North Alabama Division headquarters. The company’s Classic Food and Vending arm, customer solutions center and services department will also be housed in the facility.

The project was officially announced in May. Construction on the new facility is slated to last about three years.

“Coca-Cola UNITED’s magnificent new facility will stand as an unforgettable gateway to the Magic City and broadcast the strong message that Birmingham is a great place to build a long-lasting business,” said Ellen McNair, Secretary of the Alabama Department of Commerce.

A COCA-COLA TOAST

At the event, Coca-Cola UNITED Board Chairman Conrad Rafield led the crowd in a Coca-Cola toast to mark the occasion, citing the company’s foundational values of family, service and community.

Joining Rafield on stage during the toast were Coca-Cola UNITED Board Vice Chairman and former President and CEO John Sherman and Birmingham Coca-Cola associates with over 40 years of service to the company.

“We believe the communities we serve are not just our neighbors, but an integral part of our Coca-Cola UNITED family,” Rafield said. “We are committed to supporting and growing together for many years to come.”

Other speakers at the event included Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin, District 4 Birmingham City Councilor J.T. Moore, Jefferson County Commission President Pro-Tem Joe Knight, and District 1 Jefferson County Commissioner Lashunda Scales.",plans to relocate headquarters

You’d see canals — the Los Angeles Aqueduct, running along the base of the Sierra Nevada, carrying water from the Owens River; the State Water Project, meandering through the San Joaquin Valley, supplying many Southern California cities and farms; and the Colorado River Aqueduct, cutting through the desert on its mission to deliver water from desert to coast.

You’d see electric lines too — a sprawling network of wires that over the decades have furnished Angelenos with power from coal plants in Nevada, Utah and Montana; from nuclear reactors in Arizona; and from hydropower dams in the Pacific Northwest.

Los Angeles has reshaped the West. And the city’s Department of Water and Power has been the agent of change.

Last month, Janisse Quiñones took the helm as the agency’s new leader, after being recommended by L.A. Mayor Karen Bass and confirmed unanimously by City Council. She’s got a tough job ahead of her, with the city targeting 100% clean energy by 2035 — a decade ahead of California’s statewide goal. DWP is also trying to protect the city from climate change-fueled droughts by getting 70% of its water from local sources such as storm runoff, underground aquifers and recycling by 2035 — another huge ask.

Can we make those dreams a reality? Quiñones has been on the job less than a month, but she’s confident.

“I think we will meet both [targets]”, she told me this week at DWP’s downtown headquarters. “Ninety percent of it is attainable, and it’s going to be tough. The last 10% we might not have the answers. But I’m pretty sure we’ll get the answers.”

Quiñones comes from the private utility industry. She previously worked as senior vice president of electric operations at Pacific Gas & Electric, and before that at utilities National Grid and San Diego Gas & Electric. She also did an eight-month stint in Puerto Rico, where she grew up, helping rebuild the island’s electric grid after it was largely destroyed by Hurricane Maria in 2017.

“I was there seven days after the storm hit,” she said.

Quiñones definitely brings a private-sector mentality to DWP’s mid-century modern John Ferraro Building, where her 15th-story office offers sweeping views toward Dodger Stadium and the Hollywood Hills. In our interview, she referred to the public agency as an “engineering and construction company.” And although she’s taken on the traditional title of “chief engineer,” she won’t be called “general manager,” the other moniker bestowed on her predecessors. Instead, she’ll be DWP’s chief executive officer.

Some Angelenos may be skeptical about Bass bringing in a private-utility outsider to run DWP — especially one with a history at PG&E, which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy twice this century, most recently after igniting a series of deadly wildfires.

But I came away from our conversation impressed by Quiñones, and optimistic about what she might accomplish here.

Partly that’s because of what she said when I asked her why she wanted the job.

She told me she wanted to try her hand at advancing clean power — especially for low-income communities and communities of color — specifically through public power. She said she’d come to believe that government-run utilities — despite their reputation for being slow-moving bureaucracies — can in some cases innovate more quickly than investor-owned monopolies such as PG&E and Southern California Edison, which must endure slow regulatory proceedings at the California Public Utilities Commission.

“We can try stuff faster, and fail faster, and change faster,” Quiñones said.

“We’re not reporting to the shareholders, and for profit. Everything that we do is to serve our communities,” she added.

And here’s the thing about DWP: As much as we might recoil at its shameful history of water grabs and coal combustion, we still need it to be an engineering and construction company, or we have no chance of meeting our aggressive climate goals.

Quiñones sounds ready to shake things up — at least a little bit — and accelerate clean energy development.

“LADWP has done incredible engineering feats and construction feats in the past. This is no different,” she said.

The municipal utility has a lot going for it — more than 11,500 employees, a $6.8-billion annual budget, a progressive mayor and City Council — even if Bass has been less focused on climate than her predecessor, Eric Garcetti — and an electricity mix that was already 53% climate-friendly as of 2022 when accounting for solar, wind, geothermal, nuclear and hydropower.

DWP also commissioned a first-of-its-kind study by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory concluding Los Angeles is capable of reaching 98% clean energy by 2030 and 100% by 2035 — without spurring blackouts or disrupting the economy. The study laid out a road map for getting there, putting DWP in the enviable position of having a detailed plan to guide its ambitions.

Still, there are obstacles. And it’s up to Quiñones to push through them.

One of the biggest challenges will be securing enough solar electricity — especially from large solar farms paired with batteries, which NREL and other experts have identified as the backbone of the energy transition — to replace coal- and gas-fired power.

In 2022, solar farms supplied 14% of L.A.’s electricity, much of it coming from sprawling desert facilities in Kern County, north of the city. Unfortunately, a transmission “bottleneck” on the electric lines bringing power to L.A. is making it harder to import more solar. That means DWP must build new lines and expand the capacity of existing lines — a tricky task when it can’t just steamroll landowners, conservationists and other opponents like it could in the days before the California Environmental Quality Act.

So how will Quiñones make it happen? What’s her plan for speeding up infrastructure development and leading the world toward a sustainable future in which the heat waves, wildfires, floods and droughts of the climate crisis don’t get worse and worse?

Not an easy question. I could almost see Quiñones put on her private-sector hat before answering.

“We have to enable [DWP] to move,” she said. “We’re looking at all our organizational structures. Are we set up for success? Are we empowering everybody in the organization to come up to that full potential? Are we bringing the right consultants?”

“One of my jobs is making sure that city processes don’t slow us down from a procurement perspective,” she added.

Quiñones generally avoided getting too specific when I asked her about particular energy projects that might be in DWP’s future — partly because she’s still getting up to speed on all things Los Angeles, and partly because she answers to a five-member board of commissioners appointed by the mayor, and she needs to be careful to avoid making commitments without their approval.

Any chance Los Angeles will buy electricity from a massive Wyoming wind farm being built by billionaire Crypto.com Arena owner Phil Anschutz, who’s also stringing together a 732-mile transmission line to carry the renewable energy to California?

Quiñones said she hasn’t talked with Anschutz’s team, at least not yet.

“If the project makes sense, we’ll take it,” she said.

What about offshore wind turbines, which could help keep the lights on 24/7 by producing more consistently than onshore wind farms, and by staying strong into the evening, after solar panels stop producing? Quiñones was hopeful but noncommittal.

“We look at every possibility,” she said.

Building giant infrastructure isn’t always a good idea, as Angelenos should know from their tentacle-spreading history.

Solar farms, wind turbines and power lines can destroy wildlife habitat and disrupt scenic landscapes. Lithium mining for lithium-ion batteries can be similarly problematic. The less energy we use — and the more energy we supply locally — the better.

So I was encouraged that Quiñones said DWP should be helping Angelenos who put solar panels on their roofs get connected to the grid a lot faster — even if she wasn’t prepared to comment on whether incentives for rooftop solar should be higher.

I was also glad she expressed a interest in “virtual power plants” that limit the need for big renewable energy projects by linking up rooftops solar panels and home batteries and operating them in unison. Along the same lines, she suggested DWP would be moving forward with “vehicle to grid” programs that pay electric vehicle drivers to supply power to utilities in a pinch.

Crucially, she emphasized that DWP needs to bulk up its local electric grid to power more cars, heat pumps and induction stoves — vital technologies for removing heat-trapping fossil fuels from our lives. Those investments are especially time-sensitive ahead of the 2028 Olympic Games, by which time L.A. County hopes to electrify millions of homes, passenger vehicles and buses.

Sound hard? That’s because it will be. Especially with the fallout from a long-running ethics scandal continuing to cast a shadow over DWP — not that Quiñones sounded especially worried about the scandal interfering with her ability to do her job.

“I have to get my team working on a rebranding” of DWP, she said. “I hate to give 10% of the population of this company the power to destroy the reputation of the company when the other 90% are doing the right thing all the time.”

Some of the thorniest challenges facing Quiñones may involve four DWP-owned gas plants that still supply L.A. with lots of power — especially during heat waves, when Angelenos increasingly crank up their air conditioners to survive a warming planet.

Three of those gas plants lie along the coast — Scattergood near El Segundo, Harbor in Wilmington and Haynes in Long Beach. The fourth, Valley Generating Station, sits in the San Fernando Valley’s northeast corner, surrounded by Sun Valley and Pacoima communities that are mostly Latino and low-income, and whose residents breathe some of California’s most polluted air.

Garcetti thrilled clean energy advocates when he announced in 2019 that the city would abandon a DWP plan to invest billions of dollars upgrading the gas plants. That plan could have locked in decades of climate pollution and lung-damaging emissions.

But rather than preparing to shut down the facilities entirely, DWP wants to burn hydrogen instead.

That’s not necessarily bad. The agency has long said it needs reliable power plants in the L.A. Basin to lower the risk of blackouts during those nasty hot spells that are getting hotter with global warming. Like many utilities, it sees hydrogen as a nice substitute for fossil gas. And unlike some other utilities, it’s promised to use only “green” hydrogen generated via renewable power.

DWP intends to start burning a blend of 30% hydrogen and 70% gas at Scattergood by 2030, then ramp up to 100% hydrogen as technology improves — assuming technology improves. Some environmental justice advocates are worried it won’t work, leaving Los Angeles stuck burning gas — and communities around the power plants stuck breathing noxious fumes for years.

Even if the experiment works out, they’re worried hydrogen combustion can generate its own harmful air pollution. They’d prefer to see DWP go big on rooftop solar, virtual power plants and small-scale batteries as a substitute for the gas plants.

Quiñones said she’s doubling down on efforts to listen to communities. She also defended the importance of hydrogen.

“There’s not a lot of solutions for in-basin [electricity] generation but hydrogen or carbon-capture systems,” she said, referring to devices that snare planet-warming carbon emissions at power plants. “One of the two have to be part of the equation.”

DWP is also banking on hydrogen to replace its coal-fired Intermountain Power Plant outside Delta, Utah — for decades the city’s largest power source. As of April, there were about 1,000 construction workers on site, building a gas/hydrogen plant that’s slated to open next year, replacing the coal plant. As with the local gas turbines, the goal is to transition to 100% green hydrogen.

If Los Angeles succeeds, it could help lead the world toward a brighter future — and atone for the sins of its past.

The stolen water, the hazy air blanketing national parks, the contaminated groundwater beneath Indigenous homelands — none of that will just go away. Averting future catastrophes isn’t the same as making reparations. And as I’ve noted, building renewable energy can come with its own pitfalls. Balancing solar and wind energy development with conserving ecosystems is key.

But Quiñones has an unparalleled opportunity.

DWP is the nation’s largest public utility, Los Angeles its second-largest city. But this is about way more than population. This is L.A. — a global trendsetter through TV and the movies and star culture, through our food scene, through our tech industry and cultural diversity and sports. If you can make it happen here, you can make it happen anywhere.

If Quiñones can guide Los Angeles to 100% clean energy by 2035? Maybe the rest of the world will come along.

Unfair of me to pin that on one person? Totally.

So let’s help her out.

ONE MORE THING

A dying Joshua tree at Joshua Tree National Park in 2023. (Robert Gauthier / Los Angeles Times)

I’ve gotten lots of vitriolic criticism for arguing in a recent column that it’s not always a terrible idea to tear down Joshua trees for solar farms, given that global warming poses such a serious threat to the desert ecosystems that Joshua trees call home.

So I appreciated this thoughtful response by environmental journalist Jonathan P. Thompson, in his excellent newsletter, the Land Desk. He agreed with my premise — that we’ll probably need to pave over some ecosystems to deal with the climate crisis, painful as that may be — while arguing that the solar project that prompted my column is being built in the wrong spot.

Totally reasonable take. This is the kind of dialogue we need to be having.

I also enjoyed talking with Columbia Journalism Review’s Kevin Lind about tensions between renewable energy and conservation. You can read the Q&A here. We also discussed strategies for journalists looking to improve their climate change coverage.

This plan should include your budget, a list of objectives, a sketch of your design, and a timeline. Once you have a plan, you will be able to stay on track and ensure that your office design project is successful. Get Rid of Furniture that Does Not Fit – One of the biggest mistakes companies make is hanging on to furniture that does not fit their space. If you have old, bulky furniture, get rid of it. Not only will old furniture make your office look cluttered, it can be an eyesore.

Take Note of Technological Requirements – In today’s world, technology is a big part of most businesses. When you are planning your office design, consider the technological needs of your employees. These needs could include anything from computer monitors to Wi-Fi routers. Do not limit your tech needs to the present; consider future needs as well.

Variety Is Important – Create a space with different areas that allow employees to move around and find the space that best suits their needs. Consider spaces for private meetings, group work, and individual work. A truly flexible environment is comprised of different workspaces that can be reconfigured quickly to allow for various activities.

Include Your Employees – One of the best ways to create a successful office design is to include employees in the design process. After all, they are the ones who will be using the space. Ask for input and listen to suggestions; employees will have great ideas. Allow employees to arrange the furniture or decide how specific spaces will be used.

169,Communicating Your Relocation Plans To Your Boss,https://www.galleon-ltd.com/blog/communicating-relocation-plans-to-your-boss,,"21st-century society is far more mobile than any previous generation, and it’s often the case that people move away from home for university and end up staying or relocating for a partner or job. It is also equally the case that people sometimes have a yearning to move back home or want to relocate for more personal reasons. Any long-distance relocation is a big undertaking, and if you currently have a job, requesting a transfer to a new office or location requires careful planning and communication with your manager. So, if you're thinking, ""I want to relocate,"" but have no idea how to tell your boss you want to make the big step or how they will react, below are some tips to help you.

Be Clear About Whether Or Not Your Job Is Transferable

Before you consider talking to your boss about relocating, first be sure whether or not you can do your job from another location. Many jobs, for instance, may be successfully achieved working remotely, with only occasional face-to-face travel to your home office. Or, there may be a similar role available at a company office in your new location that you can simply transfer to. This isn’t possible for all roles, however, such as if your job depends on face-to-face relationships with an established local client base, the company you work for just has one location, or you don’t speak the language in your intended destination well enough to conduct your role to the required professional standard.

Prepare Your Case Thoroughly

If you’re confident that there is a potential opportunity to transfer within your business, prepare a case for relocation by doing your research carefully. Review any company policies on location transfers or global mobility programmes, and find out, if possible, about any similar cases to your own within the business. It’s harder for them to give you a flat no if they’ve recently approved a relocation request from a colleague in a similar role or pay scale to yourself.

For international moves, pay close attention to specific immigration and labour laws in the desired country, making it easier for your HR team to support you during the move by reducing their administrative burden. Also consider what additional skills or training you may need to be successful in the new locale and be proactive about acquiring local knowledge and learning the local language.

In particular, think about how the relocation can benefit the company, not just yourself. Could you support expansion into a new market, for example? Identify concrete ways the move could improve or add value to the business and rehearse clear explanations for your reasons for relocating and prepare responses to any questions or concerns your boss may have.

Anticipate And Address Any Concerns

Your boss will consider factors like cost, feasibility, and value to the company when evaluating a relocation request, as well as the impact on your current team, accounts/customer contacts, and your productivity. Be ready to address common concerns head-on. If you are a productive, hard-working, long-term employee, your manager may be more likely to give your request consideration and be prepared to support you financially throughout the process.

However, sometimes this may make you a victim of your own success, as your boss may be reluctant to relocate a high-value employee who is liked and respected by their present colleagues! Think through solutions to these and other challenges and ask what you can do to make the transition easier – e.g., by training up a suitable replacement, or offering to trial the move for an agreed timeframe. Outline how you can continue providing value in the new role and location.

Present A Detailed Relocation Plan

The key to success in coming to a mutually beneficial agreement is to demonstrate that you’ve thought out your relocation in detail beforehand, including the timeframe and costs. Provide draft timelines and highlight steps you will take before, during, and after the move, and address practical considerations like establishing communication channels and learning the commute or office layout ahead of time. Assure your boss that you are committed to making the change happen smoothly.

Sam Graves (MO-6) wrote Postmaster General Louis DeJoy on Thursday requesting the United States Postal Service develop a plan to ensure a post office remains in New London, Mo.

The post office closed earlier this week for repairs, with an unknown date given for reopening. In the meantime, residents with post office boxes are uncertain where they will be getting their mail during the closure.

“There has been a United States Post Office in New London since 1820,” Graves said in a press release. “Mail service is a necessity, and residents shouldn’t have to drive a great distance to get it. In the wake of this temporary closure, the people of New London deserve to have adequate interim service close to home, and they need to know what the long-term plan is to maintain a post office in New London for generations to come.”

The full letter can be read here.

Graves previously called on the Postal Service to reestablish post offices in Baring, LaGrange and Clarksville, all of which had been shuttered due to natural disasters. LaGrange and Clarksville were ultimately reopened, and Baring is in the process of rebuilding.

Graves recently introduced the Pony Up Act, which would require the Postal Service to provide a mechanism for constituents to get reimbursed for late fees that were incurred as a result of late mail delivery, which has been experienced across North Missouri. He also called on the Postal Service to halt postage price increases until it solves late delivery issues.

Graves said the Postal Service proposed shuttering thousands of post offices across the country in 2009 and 2011 to cut costs. He claimed the Postal Service has blamed financial losses for years on a mandate that required USPS to pre-fund retirement benefits.

Congress eliminated this mandate in 2022 by passing the Postal Service Reform Act, which Graves co-sponsored and supported. That measure also included a provision Graves championed for years — the preservation of a six-day mail service, which is critical for rural communities all over the country.",announced plans for new office

SCA Design has designed the office expansion of the LinkedIn Hqs in Singapore inspired by the vibrancy and commonality of the district, the design aims to “bring the outside in” – a refined translation of the culture of alfresco and outdoor squares where meaningful interactions take place.

LinkedIn Office Expansion has been awarded a 2023 Good Design Award by The Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design and The European Centre for Architecture Art Design and Urban Studies.

LinkedIn’s “neighborhood” comprises living essentials – a Micro Kitchen, open-plan workstations, a team hub, and both enclosed and open collaboration areas.

It was designed as a representation of contemporary Singapore, with landmarks depicted in commissioned artwork, and iconic bridges used as room names.

The Singapore premises is LinkedIn’s third office to be established in the Asia-Pacific region, after India and Australia.

It serves as the Asia-Pacific headquarters, acting as a link for the company’s strategic partnerships, member engagement, and sales and marketing in the region.

In achieving the design intent, focus was placed on the selection of materials to accurately underscore the local context.

Adopting “outdoor” materials and incorporating biophilic elements are some of the strategies employed in the design process.

Besides materiality, the design language of the surrounding architecture as influenced by a culture or era, is also subtly translated through shapes, colors, and patterns, creating a feeling of familiarity with the Singapore context.

In addition, a variety of workspace types are provided. For those who prefer working in their own private space, they could work in the individual booths.

For those who prefer constant interaction, they could work at the open desk areas.

Should a team need to have a quick meeting, they can easily regroup at one of the open collaboration areas.

âMajor sporting events bring about a national feelgood factor and often a related economic boost. Given how prolonged the cost of living crisis has been and with minimal sales growth in recent months, the retail and hospitality sector will certainly welcome these indications of increased spending and will be hoping that good performances from England and Scotlandâs football teams can boost spending further and carry on through an action-packed summer of sport.

âThe spending upturn is mainly related to watching the action at home â with investments being made in new TVs at the more expensive end of the scale, through to BBQs, and more commonly to plans to buy more snacks, food, soft drink and alcohol, for home consumption. One in ten people also told us they plan to order takeaway on a match day.

âAs you would expect, there is also evidence of a boost for the hospitality sector - with one in ten people saying they will head to the pub, and 6% saying they will eat out as they watch an England or Scotland game.â

Asked about how they plan to watch European Football Championship matches, which begin this week, a third of consumers said that they would watch England or Scotland (or their preferred national team) at home alone or with their usual household. This was regionally highest in London.



One in 10 people plan to watch a game at a family member or friend's house. While one in ten will invite family or friends round to their house for the match.

Making an occasion of it, 6% said they would host a BBQ on an England or Scotland match day, while 8% said they would order a takeaway for the game. Takeaway intention is highest amongst those aged 35 to 44, at 16%.

A much-needed boost to the hospitality sector is evident in the form of 13% saying they will watch England or Scotland (or their preferred national team) at the pub, while 6% said they would also eat out with friends or family on an England or Scotland (or preferred national team) match day. Plans to watch a game at the pub are highest regionally in the North East of England (at 19%), while intention to eat out on a match day is highest in Scotland (at 9%).

3% of respondents said they plan to book leave in order to watch a match. While 3% said they plan to take a sick day to watch a game.

Respondents in the East of England were the most likely to say they wonât watch any of the matches, at 47% (compared to 35% nationally).

233,Converting Office Space to Residential: The Benefits and ...,https://www.tetratecheurope.com/converting-office-space-to-residential-the-benefits-and-what-to-consider/,,"In recent times, an increasing numbers of asset owners have been exploring the possibility of repurposing their existing commercial/office buildings for residential end-uses. This trend is now gaining significant momentum as office occupancy rates appear unlikely to return to pre-pandemic levels, whilst investors face the growing possibility that these buildings become obsolete or ‘stranded assets’.

Much of the existing building stock throughout the UK, particularly older office buildings outside of major cities, appears to be particularly susceptible to this change. Asset managers are struggling to fully let these units, whilst also contending with increasing CAPEX costs due to tightening investor and legislative demands, as well as new environmental standards.

What are the benefits?

Although there are numerous, well-publicised, challenges to overcome when converting large multi-storey office buildings to residential, this shift offers significant potential upside in terms of sustainable development. Converting vacant or underutilised office buildings into residential spaces not only helps tackle the UK’s housing crisis, but also presents an opportunity to ensure embodied carbon remains embedded and the environmental impacts of construction are reduced.

One of the key advantages of repurposing office spaces is the efficient use of existing infrastructure. By utilising the existing building structure (where the floor plate configuration allows), the need for new construction and the associated resource consumption can be minimised. This adaptive reuse approach can help curb the depletion of natural resources and reduce construction-related waste.

Energy efficiency is another crucial aspect of any new refurbishment project, and converting office space to residential units provides a unique opportunity to optimise energy consumption. Operational office buildings are typically fitted with substantial air handling unit (AHU) systems and high levels of artificial lighting. Through thoughtful design and retrofitting (including careful consideration of window locations, natural light and ventilation), existing buildings can be modified to align with residential needs, resulting in significant energy savings.

Other benefits associated with the conversion of office spaces include a reduction in urban sprawl (and the protection of greenfield land), minimising the need for long commutes (thereby decreasing carbon emissions), as well as an often-improved access to amenities, public transportation, and employment centres, fostering a sustainable and vibrant community for residents.

The role of consultants

During the planning process for any office conversion, there will likely be a requirement for environmental due diligence (including land contamination and flood risk assessments). Some key considerations for environmental consultants include the potential presence of residual contamination and migration of hazardous ground gases (e.g. carbon dioxide and methane) into basement/ground floor spaces, as well as radon, asbestos and other hazardous building materials. Clients should be aware that there is a lower acceptable contaminant threshold for a residential property (as opposed to a commercial end-use), and the scope of works should be tailored accordingly.

The expertise and advice of planning consultants, building surveyors, MEP engineers, fire safety specialists, noise assessors, architects and landscape architects will also likely be required from the outset of any proposed conversion project.

When undertaking these projects, developers should take the opportunity to prioritise environmental considerations, including aiming for EPC ‘A’, BREEAM ‘Excellent’, or other similar green building certifications. Additionally, contractors can focus on improving areas such as drainage networks, waste management, and water conservation systems. Existing lower ground/basement rooms can be repurposed for cycle parking and bin stores, whilst green spaces and rooftop gardens can be integrated into the design, enhancing biodiversity, improving air quality, and providing a leisure space for residents.

Summary

There are numerous locations in the UK where existing offices are likely to become ‘stranded assets’ in the near future. These offices will become unlettable in their current condition, and the owners will be unable to secure enough tenants or charge high enough rents to justify the improvements or retrofits necessary to improve the buildings to the required standards. As a result, some owners are now exploring the possibility of converting these assets to residential units.

Whilst conversion remains an unrealistic option for many existing offices, particularly those with deep floor plates and insufficient HVAC or plumbing capabilities, converting office spaces to residential presents a compelling opportunity for sustainable urban development. By repurposing existing buildings, optimising space, promoting compact urban living, and in some cases preserving cultural heritage, we can create new opportunities for assets that appear destined to become ‘stranded’. From a climate change and town planning perspective, it makes sense to facilitate these types of conversions wherever possible, ensuring that they are conducted in a manner that prioritises sustainability and the well-being of future generations.

414,Create a branch in AWS CodeCommit,https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecommit/latest/userguide/how-to-create-branch.html,,"Create a branch in AWS CodeCommit

You can use the CodeCommit console or the AWS CLI to create branches for your repository. This is a quick way to separate work on a new or different version of files without impacting work in the default branch. After you create a branch in the CodeCommit console, you must pull that change to your local repo. Alternatively, you can create a branch locally and then use Git from a local repo connected to the CodeCommit repository to push that change.

Create a branch (console)

You can use the CodeCommit console to create a branch in a CodeCommit repository. The next time users pull changes from the repository, they see the new branch.

Open the CodeCommit console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/codesuite/codecommit/home . In Repositories, choose the name of the repository where you want to create a branch. In the navigation pane, choose Branches. Choose Create branch. In Branch name, enter a name for the branch. In Branch from, choose a branch or tag from the list, or paste a commit ID. Choose Create branch.

Create a branch (Git)

Follow these steps to use Git from a local repo to create a branch in a local repo and then push that branch to the CodeCommit repository.

These steps are written with the assumption that you have already connected the local repo to the CodeCommit repository. For instructions, see Connect to a repository.

Create a branch in your local repo by running the git checkout -b new-branch-name command, where new-branch-name is the name of the new branch. For example, the following command creates a branch named MyNewBranch in the local repo: git checkout -b MyNewBranch To push the new branch from the local repo to the CodeCommit repository, run the git push command, specifying both the remote-name and the new-branch-name . For example, to push a new branch in the local repo named MyNewBranch to the CodeCommit repository with the nickname origin : git push origin MyNewBranch

Note If you add the -u option to git push (for example, git push -u origin main), then in the future you can run git push without remote-name branch-name . Upstream tracking information is set. To get upstream tracking information, run git remote show remote-name (for example, git remote show origin). To see a list of all of your local and remote tracking branches, run git branch --all. To set up a branch in the local repo that is connected to a branch in the CodeCommit repository, run git checkout remote-branch-name .

For more options, see your Git documentation.

Create a branch (AWS CLI)

To use AWS CLI commands with CodeCommit, install the AWS CLI. For more information, see Command line reference.

Follow these steps to use the AWS CLI to create a branch in a CodeCommit repository and then push that branch to the CodeCommit repository. For steps to create an initial commit and specify the name of the default branch for an empty repository, see Create the first commit for a repository using the AWS CLI.

Run the create-branch command, specifying: The name of the CodeCommit repository where the branch is created (with the --repository-name option). Note To get the name of the CodeCommit repository, run the list-repositories command.

The name of the new branch (with the --branch-name option).

The ID of the commit to which the new branch points (with the --commit-id option). For example, to create a branch named MyNewBranch that points to commit ID 317f8570EXAMPLE in a CodeCommit repository named MyDemoRepo : aws codecommit create-branch --repository-name MyDemoRepo --branch-name MyNewBranch --commit-id 317f8570EXAMPLE This command produces output only if there are errors. To update the list of available CodeCommit repository branches in your local repo with the new remote branch name, run git remote update remote-name . For example, to update the list of available branches for the CodeCommit repository with the nickname origin : git remote update origin Note Alternatively, you can run the git fetch command. You can also view all remote branches by running git branch --all, but until you update the list of your local repo, the remote branch you created does not appear in the list. For more options, see your Git documentation. To set up a branch in the local repo that is connected to the new branch in the CodeCommit repository, run git checkout remote-branch-name .",planning to open new branch

413,Creating a Branch or Tag,https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/tgit-dug-branchtag.html,,"One of the features of version control systems is the ability to isolate changes onto a separate line of development. This line is known as a branch. Branches are often used to try out new features without disturbing the main line of development with compiler errors and bugs. As soon as the new feature is stable enough then the development branch is merged back into the main branch.

Another feature of version control systems is the ability to mark particular revisions (e.g. a release version), so you can at any time recreate a certain build or environment. This process is known as tagging.

Git is very powerful at branching and tagging. It is very easy to create branches and tags.

Creating a Branch or Tag Creating a branch is very simple: TortoiseGit → Create Branch... Figure 2.56. The Branch Dialog

Branch: input your branch name. Creating a tag is very simple: TortoiseGit → Create Tag... Figure 2.57. The Tag Dialog

Tag: input your tag name. You can choose one commit that base on. HEAD Current commit checked out. Branch The latest commit of chosen branch. Tag The commit of chosen tag. Commit Any commit, you click ... to launch log dialog to choose commit. You also can input commit hash, or friendly commit name, such as HEAD~4 . If you want your working tree to be switched to the newly created branch automatically, use the Switch to new branch/tag checkbox. But if you do that, first make sure that your working tree does not contain modifications. If it does, those changes will be merged into the branch working tree when you switch. track is a checkbox with three values. If it is checked --track is passed to git on OK, if it is unchecked --no-track is passed to git on OK. The third state indicates, that neither --track nor --no-track is passed to git on OK - see branch.autosetupmerge configuration variable (git-config(1) man-page) and --track parameter documentation for git-branch(1) man-page. Check Sign to create a GPG signed tag. This requires GPG and also the configuration variable user.signingkey to be set (see the section called “Git Config” and git-config(1) man-page). Tip When using GPG 1.4 (which is shipped with Git for Windows) this requires a key without a passphrase. GPG >= 2 comes with an agent like pageant and, thus,.also works with passphrase protected keys, however, you might need to configure git to use the right gpg.exe . This can be done be setting the configuration variable gpg.program (e.g., C:/Program Files (x86)/GNU/GnuPG/pub/gpg.exe ). We tested this with Gpg4win (Gpg4win vanilla is sufficient and with version 2.2.x it is also compatible to GPG 1.4 key files). Press OK to create branch or tag at local repository. Note that unless you opted to switch your working tree to the newly created branch, creating a Branch or Tag does not affect your working tree. Even if you create the branch from your working tree, those changes are committed to the original branch, not to the new branch. On how to switch working tree to tag/branch, please refer to the section called “Checking Out A Working Tree (Switch to commit)”.

416,Deploying Git Repositories with Vercel,https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git,,"Vercel allows for automatic deployments on every branch push and merges onto the Production Branch of your GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket projects.

Vercel allows for automatic deployments on every branch push and merges onto the Production Branch of your GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket and Azure DevOps Pipelines projects.

Using Git with Vercel provides the following benefits:

Preview Deployments for every push.

Production Deployments for the most recent changes from the Production Branch.

Instant rollbacks when reverting changes assigned to a custom domain.

When working with Git, have a branch that works as your production branch, often called main . After you create a pull request (PR) to that branch, Vercel creates a unique deployment you can use to preview any changes. Once you are happy with the changes, you can merge your PR into the main branch, and Vercel will create a production deployment.

You can choose to use a different branch as the Production Branch.

If your provider is not listed here, you can also use the Vercel CLI to deploy with any git provider.

Setting up your GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository on Vercel is only a matter of clicking the ""New Project"" button on the top right of your dashboard and following the steps.

For Azure DevOps repositories, use the Vercel Deployment Extension

After clicking it, you'll be presented with a list of Git repositories that the Git account you've signed up with has write access to.

To select a different Git namespace or provider, you can use the dropdown list on the top left of the section.

A list of Git repositories your Git account has access to.

You can also:

Select a third-party Git repository by clicking on Import Third-Party Git Repository on the bottom of the section.

Select a pre-built solution from the section on the right.

After you've selected the Git repository or template you want to use for your new project, you'll be taken to a page where you can configure your project before it's deployed.

You can:

Customize the project's name

Select a Framework Preset

Select the root directory of your project

Configure Build Output Settings

Set Environment Variables

When your settings are correct, you can select the Deploy button to initiate a deployment.

You can initiate new deployments directly from the Vercel Dashboard using a Git reference. This approach is ideal when automatic deployments are interrupted or unavailable.

To create a deployment from a Git reference:

From your dashboard, select the project you'd like to create a deployment for Select the Deployments tab. Once on the Deployments page, select the Create Deployment button Depending on how you would like to deploy, enter the following: Targeted Deployments: Provide the unique ID (SHA) of a commit to build a deployment based on that specific commit

Provide the unique ID (SHA) of a commit to build a deployment based on that specific commit Branch-Based Deployments: Provide the full name of a branch when you want to build the most recent changes from that specific branch (for example, https://github.com/vercel/examples/tree/deploy ) Select Create Deployment. Vercel will build and deploy your commit or branch as usual

When the same commit appears in multiple branches, Vercel will prompt you to choose the appropriate branch configuration. This choice is crucial as it affects settings like environment variables linked to each branch.

As an additional security measure, commits on private Git repositories (and commits of forks that are targeting those Git repositories) will only be deployed if the commit author also has access to the respective project on Vercel.

Depending on whether the owner of the connected Vercel project is a Personal Account or a Team, the behavior changes as mentioned in the sections below.

This only applies to commit authors on GitHub organizations, GitLab groups and non-personal Bitbucket workspaces. It does not apply to collaborators on personal Git accounts.

For public Git repositories, a different behavior applies.

In order to deploy commits under a Vercel Team, the commit author must be a member of the Team that contains the Vercel project that is connected to the Git repository.

The membership is checked by finding the Personal Account associated with the commit author through comparing Login Connections, and then, if a Personal Account is found, checking if it is a member of the Team.

If the commit author is not a member, the Deployment will be prevented and a request to join the Team can be issued by the commit author. After that, the owners of the Team will be notified and can either accept or decline the membership request on the Members page in the Team Settings.

Declining the request will leave the commit undeployed. If the commit author gets accepted as a member of the Team, however, their most recent commit will resume to be deployed to Vercel automatically.

Commit authors will automatically be considered a part of the Team on Vercel if one of the existing members connected their Personal Account on Vercel with the Git account that created the commit.

In order to deploy commits under a Personal Vercel Account, the commit author must be the owner of the Personal Account that contains the Vercel project that is connected to the Git repository. This is determined through comparing the Login Connections defined in the Personal Account with the commit author.

For cases in which the commit author is not the owner of the destination Personal Account, the Deployment will be prevented and a recommendation for transferring the project to a Vercel Team will be displayed on the Git provider.

After having transferred the project to a Vercel Team, commit authors can easily be added as members of that Team and will see the behavior mentioned in the section above applied for them whenever they commit.

When a public repository is forked, commits from it will usually deploy automatically. However, when you receive a pull request from a fork of your repository that includes a change to the vercel.json file or the project has Environment Variables, Vercel will require authorization from you or a Team Member to deploy the pull request. This is a security measure that protects you from leaking sensitive project information. A link to authorize the Deployment will be posted as a comment on the Pull Request.

The authorization step will be skipped if the commit author is already a Team Member on Vercel.

A Production Deployment will be created each time you merge to the Production Branch.

When you create a new Project from a Git repository on Vercel, the Production Branch will be selected in the following order:

The main branch.

branch. If not present, the master branch (more details).

branch (more details). [Only for Bitbucket] If not present, the ""Production Branch"" setting of your Git repository is used.

If not present, the Git repository's default branch.

On the Git page in the Project Settings, you can change your Production Branch.

Whenever a new commit is then pushed to the branch you configured here, a Production Deployment will be created for you.

While the Production Branch (mentioned above) is a single Git branch that contains the code that is served to your visitors, Preview Branches are all the Git branches that are not the Production Branch.

For example, if your Production Branch is main , then all the Git branches that are not main are considered Preview Branches. That means there can be many Preview Branches, but only a single Production Branch.

Preview Branches, like the name already suggests, are used for previewing changes before presenting them to your visitors (merging them into Production).

By default, every Preview Branch automatically receives its own Domain similar to the one shown below, whenever a commit is pushed to it:

url-composition < project-name > -git- < branch-name > - < scope-slug > .vercel.app;

Additionally, any Environment Variables defined for the Preview Environment are applied.

You can also receive feedback from team members and other collaborators through Vercel's Comments feature. Comments can be tracked and resolved from within a PR on GitHub.

Once you're happy with your changes, you would then merge the respective Preview Branch into your Production Branch.

For most use cases, the default Preview behavior mentioned above is enough.

If you'd like your changes to pass through multiple phases of previewing instead of just one, you can accomplish it like so:

Domains and Environment Variables can both be assigned to specific Preview Branches on their individual settings pages. For Domains, it can be done like this and for Environment Variables like this.

For example, you could create a phase called ""Staging"" where you can accumulate Preview changes before merging them onto Production by following these steps:

Create a Git branch called ""staging"" in your Git repository. Add a Domain of your choice (like ""staging.example.com"") on your Vercel project and assign it to the ""staging"" Git branch like this. Add Environment Variables that you'd like to use for your new Staging phase on your Vercel project like this.

Afterwards, you can push to the ""staging"" Git branch to update your Staging phase and it will automatically receive the Domain and Environment Variables you've defined.

Once you're happy with your changes, you would then merge the respective Preview Branch into your Production Branch. However, unlike with the default Preview behavior, you'd then keep the branch around instead of deleting it, so that you can push to it again in the future.",planning to open new branch

200,Economic Growth - United Nations Sustainable Development,https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/economic-growth/,,"Goal 8 is about promoting inclusive and sustainable economic growth, employment and decent work for all.

Multiple crises are placing the global economy under serious threat. Global real GDP per capita growth is forecast to slow down in 2023 and with ever increasing challenging economic conditions, more workers are turning to informal employment.

Globally, labour productivity has increased and the unemployment rate has decreased. However, more progress is needed to increase employment opportunities, especially for young people, reduce informal employment and labour market inequality (particularly in terms of the gender pay gap), promote safe and secure working environments, and improve access to financial services to ensure sustained and inclusive economic growth.

The global unemployment rate declined significantly in 2022, falling to 5.4 per cent from a peak of 6.6 per cent in 2020 as economies began recovering from the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic. This rate was lower than the pre-pandemic level of 5.5 per cent in 2019.

What does “decent work” mean?

Decent work means opportunities for everyone to get work that is productive and delivers a fair income, security in the workplace and social protection for families, better prospects for personal development and social integration. A continued lack of decent work opportunities, insufficient investments and under-consumption lead to an erosion of the basic social contract underlying democratic societies: that all must share in progress.

What are the challenges?

A persistent lack of decent work opportunities, insufficient investments and under-consumption contribute to the erosion of the basic social contract: that all must share in progress. The creation of quality jobs remain a major challenge for almost all economies.

Achieving Goal 8 will require a wholesale reform of the financial system to tackle rising debts, economic uncertainty and trade tensions, while promoting equitable pay and decent work for young people.

Sustained and inclusive economic growth can drive progress, create decent jobs for all and improve living standards.

How many people are unemployed?

The estimated total global unemployment in 2022 was 192 million. Projections indicate that global unemployment is expected to decrease further to 5.3 per cent in 2023, equivalent to 191 million people.

The pandemic disproportionately affected women and youth in labour markets. Women experienced a stronger recovery in employment and labour force participation than men.

However, young people aged 15–24 continue to face severe difficulties in securing decent employment, and the global youth in 2022, unemployment rate is much higher than the rate for adults aged 25 and above. Globally, nearly 1 in 4 young people – 289 million – were not in education, employment or training.

What can we do to fix these issues?

Providing youth the best opportunity to transition to a decent job calls for investing in education and training of the highest possible quality, providing youth with skills that match labour market demands, giving them access to social protection and basic services regardless of their contract type, as well as leveling the playing field so that all aspiring youth can attain productive employment regardless of their gender, income level or socio-economic background.

Governments can work to build dynamic, sustainable, innovative and people-centred economies, promoting youth employment and women’s economic empowerment, in particular, and decent work for all.

Implementing adequate health and safety measures and promoting supportive working environments are fundamental to protecting the safety of workers, especially relevant for health workers and those providing essential services.",planning office expansion

64,Electronic voting worries security experts. Nevada touts ...,https://fox59.com/news/politics/ap-politics/ap-nevada-has-a-plan-to-expand-electronic-voting-that-concerns-election-security-experts/,4 дня назад,"SCHURZ, Nevada (AP) — Members of the Walker River Paiute Tribe have watched the boundaries of their land recede over time along with the waters of the lake that are central to their identity, threatening the cultural symbol that gave the tribe its name — Agai Dicutta, or Trout Eaters.

Not wanting to cede their voice, tribal leaders have been making a push for expanded voting rights. That effort includes filing a lawsuit on behalf of all Nevada tribes seeking polling places on tribal lands and access to early voting.

“Tribes shouldn’t have to keep filing lawsuits just to vote on their own lands,” said Elveda Martinez, 65, a tribal member and longtime voting advocate. “It should be more accessible.”

The state has now granted the Walker River Paiutes and other tribes in Nevada a new right that advocates hope will greatly expand voting access for a community that gained U.S. citizenship only a century ago.

Voting on reservations across the country has historically been difficult, with tribal voters sometimes having to travel dozens of miles to their polling place. Slow mail service and lack of a physical address, common on tribal lands, have proved challenging.

The new process — the ability to cast ballots electronically — has the potential to significantly boost turnout among all tribes in Nevada. But what some see as a small measure of justice to equalize voting rights raises security concerns for others, with implications far beyond Nevada’s 28 tribal communities as the nation braces for what is expected to be another close and contentious presidential election in November.

Under the plan, tribal members in Nevada who live on a reservation or colony can receive a ballot electronically through an online system set up by the state and then return it electronically. While not speaking specifically about Nevada’s system, experts warn that such voting — when a completed ballot is sent back either by email, through an online portal or by fax — carries risks of ballots being intercepted or manipulated and should be used sparingly, if at all.

“At this point in the United States, it’s a relatively small number of ballots that are coming through that way,” said Larry Norden, an election expert with the Brennan Center for Justice. “But we should be very concerned — both from actual security risks but also from a public confidence point of view — about expanding this.”

‘HIGH-RISK ACTIVITY’

While electronic voting may be limited at the moment, it’s available across much of the country to specific groups of voters. More than 30 states allow certain voters to return their ballots either by fax, email or an online portal, according to data collected by the National Conference of State Legislatures and Verified Voting, a nonpartisan group that studies state voting systems.

In most cases, electronic ballot return is available only to U.S. military and overseas voters. But it’s been expanded in recent years to include voters with disabilities in a dozen states. Nevada is believed to be the first to add tribes.

Cal Boone, the new tribal outreach coordinator for the Nevada Secretary of State’s Office and a member of the Walker River Paiute Tribe, has begun meeting with tribes around the state to share details about the process, which he believes could ease a legacy of barriers that has left some reluctant to vote.

“In past years, tribes didn’t have access to vote in multiple ways. You had to rely on the mail system to cast your vote or otherwise drive out to great lengths to vote,” Boone said. “What we are seeing in Nevada is really powerful, and it really sets the stage for what other states throughout the country can be doing to help support tribes.”

But the solution comes with risks.

In a 2020 memo to election officials, the FBI and other federal agencies assessed the risk of sending ballots electronically to be low, but allowing those ballots to be returned electronically was high. The memo highlights recommended security practices for systems that use internet or network connections.

“The information provided should be considered a starting point,” the memo states. “Even with these technical security considerations, electronic ballot return remains a high-risk activity.”

Earlier this year, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is charged with helping protect the nation’s election systems, said in an online post that the memo was being redistributed to ensure state officials and policymakers are “fully informed of risks” associated with electronic ballot return.

Susannah Goodman, director of election security for Common Cause, is among those concerned that there are no federal guidelines for such systems and no independent reviews, unlike what’s in place for voting machines and ballot tabulators.

An attempt to create independent standards ended in late 2022 after a group of experts determined it wasn’t possible at the time given the technology and cyber risks.

‘CONFIDENT IN OUR SYSTEM’

Kim Wyman, the former top election official in Washington state, initially supported electronic voting as a military spouse, but said she grew wary after taking over as secretary of state. Her attempt to persuade lawmakers to repeal it was unsuccessful.

Wyman said she worries something could happen to the ballot in transit and what that would mean for public confidence in elections. She believes the safest bet is for voters who receive ballots electronically to print them out and return them by mail.

“Election officials are in a hard spot because they want to provide accessibility and they want to make sure that every eligible American has a right to participate in an election,” Wyman said. “But they have to do it in a way where they’re also securing those ballots and making sure that that voter’s ballot is counted the way the voter cast it.”

Nevada Secretary of State Cisco Aguilar said he knows the process carries risks, but sees everything related to elections as having some risk. He pointed to the federal government’s action in 2017 to designate the nation’s voting systems as critical infrastructure, just like dams, banks and nuclear power plants.

The state’s electronic ballot return system was designed by the state with security measures intended to verify eligibility, authenticate voters and their ballots, and ensure secure communications, he said. There are steps to ensure voters are not casting multiple ballots, and the system undergoes regular security reviews and updates.

“I’m confident in our system,” Aguilar said.

He expressed frustration about what he described as a lack of national leadership on this and other election issues, saying there should be less criticism and more work and funding to address concerns.

“The federal government has access to so many experts, they have access to resources. They should be providing a leadership position to give us a path forward,” Aguilar said. “To think backward and to scare us is not the appropriate way to do this.”

STATES DIVIDED OVER SECURITY CONCERNS

So far, few Nevada voters have opted in. As of Friday, 255 voters had submitted a ballot electronically — none of them tribal members — ahead of Tuesday’s primary. More than half of those were registered in Clark County, which includes Las Vegas and is the state’s most populous.

“Folks that participate find it very convenient and very easy to use,” Clark County Registrar Lorena Portillo said.

Ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, just over 2,500 voters returned their ballots electronically through the state system. Among them was Ramona Coker, who is blind. Coker said she no longer needs help to vote and can cast a ballot on her phone, which is equipped with screen-reading technology allowing her to follow audio prompts to make her selections.

“It feels very American. It feels like you have done your part and no one else has had an influence in that,” said Coker, who works for a Reno-area nonprofit.

She believes the challenges faced by voters with disabilities outweigh the potential risks of electronic balloting.

“We’re always going to have bad-faith actors out there, no matter what delivery form or what return form that we use,” Coker said. “And if you’re always worried about that, then you never cast a vote again.”

States led by both Democrats and Republicans have authorized electronic ballot returns, with varying rules. Alaska, California, Florida and Oklahoma limit the process to military and overseas voters and only permit electronic return by fax. In Texas, astronauts can use an online portal to cast their ballots. In West Virginia, first responders on duty outside their county also are eligible.

“Having been in the military, I’ve seen intelligence transmitted via the internet. We transmit nuclear codes via the internet,” West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner said. “If we can do that, we can certainly get a secure ballot and transmit across the internet.”

Not all states have embraced the practice. In Minnesota, officials considered it but ultimately decided against it.

“In light of recent security concerns, it’s on ice,” said Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon. “Someday — if those security considerations are addressed and if the concerns and objections of the federal agencies can be overcome — we would definitely consider it because as a matter of convenience, it would probably make a difference.”

DIDN’T FEEL ‘OUR VOICE EVEN MATTERED’

The Walker River Paiute reservation is along a scenic stretch of highway between Las Vegas and Reno, about two hours south of the state capital in a vast stretch of desert surrounded by distant mountain peaks.

On a late spring day, sprinklers prepare alfalfa fields that dot the reservation while wild horses graze in nearby foothills. There are no grocery stores, restaurants or hotels, and the nearest town is about 30 miles away.

Although the tribe has long had its own polling location — something other tribes in the state have not — the reservation’s remoteness has sometimes added to a sense of political isolation. Some tribal members have not always seen the point in voting.

“Because of the historical abuses our people have faced, we were very timid to even take part in voting or elections,” tribal Chair Andrea Martinez said. “For many years, we didn’t feel like our voice even mattered.”

The prospect of casting ballots electronically is a step Martinez and other tribal leaders welcome, but they’re not sure it will make a major difference, at least initially. Internet access is spotty on the reservation, as is electricity because of aging utility poles.

“Although we, through the state, can access online voting, who knows if we’ll even have electricity or internet that day?” Martinez said.

Teresa McNally, who oversees the election office in Mineral County, which includes the Walker River reservation, plans to hold a meeting with tribal members this year to explain the new system.

One thing she wants to emphasize is the focus on security, including the measures protecting the electronic ballot return system.

“What it takes to even get into our internet system here, it’s crazy,” she said.

Courtney Quintero, a tribal member and chair of the board overseeing tribal elections, said she planned to use the new system once she learned more about it, but acknowledged others may be hesitant.

“Trust is a big thing with our community,” she said.

Announced by Member of Parliament Dr. Brendan Hanley and Minister Richard Mostyn, the lift station will support new residential development, including 43 new Frances Avenue lots, which are currently under construction.

Under the Frances Avenue and Land Distribution Agreement announced in 2023, the Government of Yukon will make 24 of the 43 lots available to the general public. Liard First Nation will hold title to 18 lots and the Town of Watson Lake will hold title to one. The sanitary lift station for this project will also support a second phase of future development.

Strategic investments in green infrastructure when developing residential areas helps the local economy and builds a sustainable future for northerners. Improving daily life through additions to the wastewater collection system for the Town of Watson Lake supports the growth of the community.

Lift stations transport wastewater from their water source to their treatment area and for this community it would be the Watson Lake lagoon. Ensuring that this new development area has effective wastewater management is part of investing in stable and supportive housing for the community in the long-term. The governments of Canada and Yukon work collaboratively in promoting reconciliation by advancing projects that will increase access to housing for Liard First Nation citizens and residents of the Town of Watson Lake.

49,FAQs - Florida Prepaid College Board,https://www.myfloridaprepaid.com/prepaid-plans/faqs/,,"How does a Florida Prepaid Plan work?

A Florida Prepaid College Plan allows families to lock in college plan prices and prepay, on a monthly or lump-sum basis, the future cost of college tuition, tuition differential fee, local fees and, optionally, dormitory housing. When your student is ready for college, the Plan pays the costs covered under your plan type at any Florida College or State University, even if the cost of college is higher than anticipated when your plan prices were set. That is one of the major advantages of a Prepaid Plan, and it’s backed by a guarantee from the State of Florida. If your student attends an out-of-state college or private college, the plan will pay the same amount as it would pay at a public college or university in Florida. Prepaid Plans also work with scholarships, and you can use them together to cover even more college expenses. If your child receives a scholarship, you can get a refund for the same amount as the plan would pay a public college or university in Florida. Every Prepaid Plan is guaranteed by the State of Florida to pay the tuition and fees covered by your plan, and you can never lose what you have paid into the plan. Also, your student has 10 years from their projected college enrollment date to use the plan. This means that by purchasing a plan for a newborn, for example, you are able to lock in the costs covered by a Florida Prepaid Plan for the next 28 years (i.e., 18 years until they can start college plus 10 years after that to finish college).",plans to expand office

OPM may approve other categories for coverage upon written request from the head of an executive agency.

Excluded Positions

A relocation incentive may not be paid to Presidential appointees (except career SES appointees); noncareer appointees in the Senior Executive Service; those in positions excepted from the competitive service by reason of their confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating natures; agency heads; those expected to receive an appointment as an agency head; or SES limited term appointees or SES limited emergency appointees when the appointment must be cleared through the White House Office of Presidential Personnel.

Relocation to Different Geographic Area

A relocation incentive may be paid to an employee who-

Must relocate to a different geographic area (permanently or temporarily) to accept a covered position in an agency when the position is likely to be difficult to fill; and

Is an employee of the Federal Government immediately before the relocation. (See 5 CFR 575.205(a).)

A position is considered to be in a different geographic area if the worksite of the new position is 50 or more miles from the worksite of the position held immediately before the move. If the worksite of the new position is less than 50 miles from the worksite of the position held immediately before the move, but the employee must relocate (i.e., establish a new residence) to accept the position, an authorized agency official may waive the 50-mile requirement and pay the employee a relocation incentive. In all cases, an employee must establish a residence in the new geographic area before the agency may pay the employee a relocation incentive.

An employee receiving a relocation incentive may establish a residence in the new geographic location in several ways, including but not limited to—

purchasing or renting of a home, apartment, or condominium;

residing at a residence of a friend or family member; or

temporarily residing at a hotel

The employee does not need to terminate an existing residence nor physically move his or her family, household, goods, etc. to the residence in the new geographical location in order to receive a relocation incentive. For example, the employee could retain a residence of record in a different geographic area and live in the new duty location during the work week.

Maintaining a Residence in the New Geographic Location

In addition to establishing a residence in the new geographic location before the payment of a relocation incentive, an employee must maintain a residence in the new geographic location for the duration of the service agreement. A relocation incentive will be terminated for employees who fail to maintain a residence throughout the service agreement in the new geographic location. Periodically throughout the service agreement, employees may be required to provide proof of residence. Examples of proof of residence include a lease, proof of purchasing property, utility bill, or a similar document to ensure the employee still resides in the new location.

Agency Plan

Before paying a relocation incentive, an agency must establish a relocation incentive plan. The plan must include the designation of officials with authority to review and approve the payment of relocation incentives, the designation of officials with authority to waive the repayment of a relocation incentive, the categories of employees who may not receive relocation incentives, the required documentation for determining that a position is likely to be difficult to fill, requirements for determining the amount of a relocation incentive, the payment methods that may be authorized, requirements governing service agreements (including criteria for determining the length of a service period, the conditions for terminating a service agreement, and the obligations of the agency and the employee if a service agreement is terminated), and documentation and recordkeeping requirements. Unless the head of the agency determines otherwise, an agency relocation incentive plan must apply uniformly across the agency.

Approval Criteria

For each relocation incentive authorized, an agency must document in writing the basis for determining that the position is likely to be difficult to fill in the absence of a relocation incentive, the amount and timing of the incentive payments, the length of the service period, and that the worksite of the new position is in a different geographic area than the previous position. The determination to pay a relocation incentive must be made before the employee enters on duty in the position at the new duty station. The authorized agency official must review and approve the relocation incentive determination before the agency pays the incentive to the employee. Agency determinations to pay a relocation incentive must generally be made on a case-by-case basis.

An agency also may determine that a position is likely to be difficult to fill if the agency is likely to have difficulty recruiting candidates with the competencies (i.e., knowledge, skills, abilities, behaviors, and other characteristics) required for the position (or group of positions) in the absence of a relocation incentive based on a consideration of the factors listed in 5 CFR 575.206(b). An agency also may determine that a position is likely to be difficult to fill if OPM has approved the use of a direct-hire authority applicable to the position.

Groups of Employees

An agency may waive the case-by-case approval requirement when the employee is a member of a group of employees subject to a mobility agreement or when a major organizational unit is being relocated to a new duty station. Under such a waiver, an agency must specify the group of employees covered, the conditions under which the waiver is approved, and the period of time during which the waiver may be applied. Groups of employees must be approved for relocation incentives using the same criteria that apply to individuals. (See 5 CFR 575.208(b).)

Payment

A relocation incentive may not exceed 25 percent of the employee's annual rate of basic pay in effect at the beginning of the service period multiplied by the number of years (including fractions of a year) in the service period (not to exceed 4 years). With OPM approval, this cap may be raised to 50 percent (based on a critical agency need), as long as the total incentive does not exceed 100 percent of the employee's annual rate of basic pay at the beginning of the service period. (See 5 CFR 575.209(c).) The incentive may be paid as an initial lump-sum payment at the beginning of the service period, in installments throughout the service period, as a final lump-sum payment upon completion of the service period, or in a combination of these methods. The agency may not pay a relocation incentive until the employee establishes a residence in the new geographic area.

Rate of Basic Pay

For the purpose of calculating a relocation incentive, an employee's rate of basic pay includes a special rate under 5 CFR part 530, subpart C, a locality payment under 5 CFR part 531, subpart F, or similar payment under other legal authority, but excludes additional pay of any other kind. A relocation incentive is not part of an employee's rate of basic pay for any purpose.

Aggregate Pay Limitation

Payment of a relocation incentive is subject to the aggregate limitation on pay under 5 CFR part 530, subpart B.

Service Agreement

Before receiving a relocation incentive, an employee must sign a written agreement to complete a specified period of employment with the agency at the new duty station. The service agreement must specify the length, commencement, and termination dates of the service period; the amount of the incentive; the method and timing of incentive payments; the conditions under which an agreement will be terminated by the agency; any agency or employee obligations if a service agreement is terminated (including the conditions under which the employee must repay an incentive or under which the agency must make additional payments for partially completed service); and any other terms and conditions for receiving and retaining a relocation incentive.

An agency may not commence a relocation incentive service agreement during a service period established by an employee's recruitment incentive service agreement or previously authorized relocation incentive service agreement. An agency may commence a relocation incentive service agreement during a service period established by an employee's previously authorized retention incentive service agreement or while an employee receives previously authorized retention incentive payments without a service agreement.

Service Period

The employee's required service period may not exceed 4 years. The service period must begin upon the commencement of service at the new duty station and end on the last day of a pay period. The commencement of the service period may be delayed under certain conditions described in 5 CFR 575.210(b).

Termination of a Service Agreement

Discretionary

An agency may unilaterally terminate a relocation incentive service agreement based solely on the management needs of the agency, in which case the employee is entitled to relocation incentive payments attributable to completed service and to retain any incentive payments already received that are attributable to uncompleted service.

Mandatory

An agency must terminate a service agreement if an employee is demoted or separated for cause (i.e., for unacceptable performance or conduct), receives a rating of record lower than ""Fully Successful"" or equivalent during the service period, fails to maintain a residence at the new geographic location for the duration of the service agreement, or otherwise fails to fulfill the terms of the service agreement. In such cases, the employee may retain any relocation incentive payments attributable to completed service, but must repay any portion of the incentive attributable to uncompleted service. (See 5 CFR 575.211(h) for a repayment waiver authority.) The agency is not obligated to pay the employee any outstanding incentive payment attributable to completed service unless such payment was required under the terms of the relocation incentive service agreement. The full amount of the authorized relocation incentive must be prorated across the length of the service period to determine the amount attributable to completed service and uncompleted service.

An agency must notify an employee in writing when it terminates a relocation incentive service agreement. The termination of a service agreement is not grievable or appealable.

In April, Simon Property Group announced plans to redevelop the area, beginning with the closure of Saks Fifth Avenue.

According to Simon, the redevelopment will add One Keystone Crossing, which will feature office spaces that are expected to open in the first quarter of 2026.

Simon Property Group

The redevelopment is set to bring in more retail brands, first-to-market dining and entertainment options, an engaging outdoor plaza, and an innovative new office space, according to developers.

“The Fashion Mall at Keystone’s redevelopment will further enhance the center’s positioning as the region’s premier experiential shopping destination and a gathering place for the community,” Patrick Peterman, Senior Vice President, Mixed-use Development at Simon, said.

106,Five Steps to Finding the Perfect Office Space,http://startupsmagazine.co.uk/article-five-steps-finding-perfect-office-space,,"This could be a traditional office, a space designed for remote work, or a mix of both. Factors such as location, interior design, and perks all have a significant impact on the desirability of your company office. Follow these five steps when choosing the right office space for your business.

1. Prioritize Office Location

Office location matters because people don’t want a long commute.

According to Clutch’s research, nearly half of employees (49%) say being near their home is the most important factor of an office’s location. Only 30% of offices are actually near employees’ homes, though.

A short commute makes for happier, healthier, and more productive employees.

Businesses should consider offices that are near employees’ homes or public transit.

If commuting isn’t a burden, businesses can better attract and retain workers from a wider geographic area. The availability of parking is also important, as most workers drive alone to work (70%).

Employees also appreciate being near restaurants and coffee shops.

Though most employees bring their lunch to work the majority of days, options for food and drink help promote workplace satisfaction.

Research where your employees live, and choose an office space that offers a convenient commute.

2. Consider Office Comfort and Spaciousness

Companies should seek offices with more space and comfort than their previous location.

Employees spend most of their time at work, so businesses must make their office a place employees want to be.

This means providing ample space for employees to accomplish tasks, both in personal offices and shared work areas.

High ceilings are especially conducive to creative work and feelings of freedom in the workplace. This means that an office with ceilings of at least 10 feet can improve engagement and satisfaction.

Half of surveyed employees say a more visually appealing space is a benefit of office relocation.

Better furniture, interior finishes, and plenty of natural light help employees feel at home in the new workplace. A great view, whether out the windows or via rooftop or balcony access, also enhances peoples’ workplace satisfaction.

A roomy, beautiful office helps employees feel valued and excited about coming to work.

3. Choose a Space With Varied Rooms

Offices with varied workspaces add a much-desired sense of autonomy to the workplace.

To help employees thrive, look for an office with a variety of spaces for employees to complete tasks.

Most American businesses offer a variety of spaces in their offices:

Personal spaces (74%)

Large meeting rooms (56%)

Small collaborative spaces (53%)

Places to relax (51%)

Quiet spaces (41%)

Choose an office design that suits your employees’ needs and the flow of work at your business.

For example, if employees work remotely part-time, you may opt for an office with more collaborative workspaces and fewer meeting areas.

Employees value flexibility in their work area, but they also want their own personal space.

Clutch’s research found that 53% of employees value their personal space more than any other office space.

Even in unconventional office spaces, personalised work areas are key to employee satisfaction.

4. Work With a Commercial Real Estate Broker

Though an increased investment, hiring a commercial real estate broker can ease the challenges of office relocation.

A commercial real estate company can help you find and secure a desirable office space efficiently and without hassle. Without a broker, companies may find it harder to be taken seriously and get their needs met in a timely fashion.

A broker also ensures that you get a fair deal and avoid hidden charges or profit centres for the landlord.

A commercial real estate company can smooth the process of office relocation, saving you both time and headaches.

5. Ask Employees What Matters to Them in an Office

Companies should consider employees’ desires when relocating to a new office.

“It’s important that employees feel they have some say in the moving process – location, accessibility, some design input,” said Commercial Realtor Michelle Mumoli, CEO of the Mumoli Bush Group.

Solicit feedback from employees to ensure a good fit for your new offices.

This way, you can be confident that your office has the location and design needed to keep staff motivated and productive.

Office relocation is also a chance for companies to offer new perks to employees.

According to Forbes, 87% of workers want their employer to offer healthier workspace benefits such as:

Wellness rooms

Company fitness benefits

Sit-stand desks

Healthy lunch options

Ergonomic seating

Meet with staff then choose a space that’s optimal for your employees.

Relocating to a Perfect Office

Office space has an increasingly large impact on a business’s ability to attract and retain employees.

Location is the most important factor for employees, but interior design, comfort and workspace flexibility are also essential to a rewarding workspace.

664,Fleet Alliance Group in office expansion mode,https://www.fleetalliance.co.uk/fleet-alliance-group-in-office-expansion-mode/,,"We are growing here at Fleet Alliance.

Not in that oh-I-must-get-to-the-gym sense because the trousers are getting a little too, you know, fitted.

But growing in the sense of expansion. Bigger. Larger. (That’s bulging biceps rather than sagging six-pack.)

Intelligent Car Leasing, part of the Fleet Alliance Group, is moving to its own offices in our Skypark HQ in Glasgow.

We’ve just taken a five-year lease on an additional 3,324 sq ft of space – three floors down from the mothership. This gives us a total of 10,000 sq ft at the top of the modern urban business park located on the outskirts of the city centre.

It will certainly give Intelligent Car Leasing the room they need to grow their business, along with housing our tech and marketing teams. And it gives us further room for expansion at Fleet Alliance.

We’ve had an exceptional year of growth. We’ve increased the number of vehicles we manage to 37,000 – representing a total capital asset value of £1 billion – and we need to increase our headcount to 150 to ensure we can manage this growth effectively.

As well as this, I’m expecting further sales expansion over the coming months – plus potential acquisitions – so we must ensure we have the resources to handle this.

Now I’m fully aware that some people might question the wisdom of expanding at such a time of economic and political instability. Such caution I fully understand.

But this background instability has been with us for the last 12 months and that has not held us back. If anything, the certainty of leasing is creating the right environment for growth.

But I can see more.

Certain challenges have held back the availability of both electric (EVs) and plug-in electric hybrids (PHEVs) during 2019; those barriers to availability will not be present in 2020.

And we’re noting a real pent up demand for electric vehicles, particularly from business fleets. With company car taxation benefit-in-kind clear for the next few years, and pure EVs rated at 0% BIK in 2020/21 who wouldn’t want a Tesla Model 3 on the company? Or a new VW I.D3? Or a MINI Cooper S electric? And yet pay nothing for the benefit?

Added to which there will be plenty of marketing around these new vehicles, so that I can see demand for leasing only going one way in 2020. And that’s up.

So growth. Bring it on.

We’re ripped and ready to go.",upcoming office expansion

A consolidated Council office to better serve our community.

We are planning for the future by looking at how best to accommodate our changing workforce and improve customer experience.

Our investigations have found the best model for the future is one consolidated main office (rather than the current three offices) with major and minor satellite offices spread throughout the Shire.

This tiered approach will ensure our community can access services and chat with us face to face, even in some of our smaller townships, while reducing the current cost of maintaining three large offices.

In November, Council endorsed an Operating Model and a Site Analysis that shortlisted potential locations for such a facility.

We are investigating these shortlisted sites to select the best location for a consolidated Council office (Tier 1):

35 Wannaeue Place, Rosebud

5 Queen Street, Mornington

Waterloo Place Car Park, Mornington

2 Queen Street, Mornington

90 Besgrove Street, Rosebud

21 Marine Parade, Hastings

350 Dunns Road (Civic Reserve), Mornington

No matter which location is deemed most suitable, customer service will remain in place at all three current locations (Hastings, Mornington and Rosebud).

Why is it needed?

Ageing and unsafe office infrastructure, rising maintenance costs and a focus on improving access to services and customer experience has prompted the project.

We have found that a consolidated workplace will help improve the delivery of services to our community, while reducing costs and supporting our commitment to more environmentally sustainable practices.

What are the benefits?

A consolidated workplace with satellite offices will:

Improve service delivery

Improve customer service and our ability to support the community

Enable greater connection with our communities across the 44 villages and towns

Increase collaboration and connection within the organisation

Support organisational flexibility

Reduce costs from duplication and maintaining multiple offices

Reduce construction costs and building footprint (one major building)

Increase sustainability through a minimised infrastructure footprint

Resolve access, safety and non-compliance issues within current office spaces

Allow greater flexibility to explore options for all Shire-owned land and assets.





Will you construct a new building or upgrade an existing office (Rosebud, Mornington or Hastings)?

Identifying the best location for the new main office and satellite offices is currently underway. The seven shortlisted sites include the current three main office buildings and several other options.

Each site will be assessed to determine its suitability to accommodate a consolidated Council office and ability to deliver significant opportunities and benefits to the wider local community.

An Expression of Interest process will help us identify private and public partnership opportunities including any additional sites for consideration.

infuture.institute and Skanska office company have once again undertaken to define trends related to the spaces in which we work and in which we will work. Our first joint project was the report “Living buildings. Office buildings of the future” indicating what the future of office buildings will look like. It included five different scenarios in the medium and long term. Now the time has come for entering the interior and looking at how the work spaces themselves will change and what they will provide to employees. That is why we are publishing the report “Future of The Office Spaces”.

Home (like) Office?

The Home (like) Office social trend is associated with the domestication of space, a trend that we observe every day, also in urban space. Domesticated office spaces can be described as the “third space” – something between a personalized space at home and a formal workplace which constitutes the company’s showcase. A half of the respondents to the quantitative survey expect this type of office space in the future.

I hope that the results of the research – both quantitative and qualitative -presented in this report will inspire you to create offices of the future. It is very important that they are most friendly for the current generation, defined often as Indoor Generation. The research shows that we spend 90% of our time inside buildings, as well as in office buildings. How they are designed will determine our wellbeing, health, and efficiency and energy at work. However, the fact that the direction in which we are moving seems to be the right one inspires optimism.

Chillout zones – a good direction of change

Today, work and office spaces are becoming places where not only body comfort is taken care of, but also mental balance or actions aimed at eliminating stress are ensured – as indicated by the Human-Centric Office trend. 81% of respondents to the quantitative survey believe that chillout zones at work are a good direction for the office development.

Types of offices and user expectations

The types of offices in which users work affect their expectations towards space. Residents of coworking (92%) and open space (77%) are the biggest enthusiasts of integration and games zones at work. Also, social changes, especially generational changes and expectations of the youngest generations Y and Z towards work, as well as the development of the so-called gig economy – the economy of freelancers are not without significance. Today, work and office spaces are becoming places where not only body comfort is taken care of (ever more comfortable and ergonomic furniture: chairs, adjustable and personalized desks, physical activities, yoga rooms, massage rooms), but also mental balance or actions aimed at eliminating stress are ensured (education in the field of life energy management or emotions and stress management). The importance of a holistic approach and ensuring a sense of general psychophysical wellbeing of employees is becoming a hot issue.

By placing people and their needs at the heart of our interests, we can simultaneously strive for sustainable development of the company. Therefore, at Skanska we aim to implement only low-emission, and in the near future, zero-emission buildings, thereby acting for the benefit of human, the environment and future generations.

How do we care about wellbeing?

Such factors as daylight and proper accoustics also affect employees’ wellbeing (of body and soul). The respondents to the quantitative survey conducted for the needs of the report indicated that, for their wellbeing, their workplace should be at the window (91%).

The research of infuture.institute shows that everyone, regardless of age, gender or office location, likes green spaces. As many as 82% of respondents to the quantitative survey conducted for the purposes of this report declared that they like when there are flowers and plants associated with the Sustainable Office trend in the offices.

In the continuing reboot of the American workplace, millions of employees in the US and worldwide have been pulled in different directions by swerving trends. Hybrid, fully remote, flexible schedules, four-day workweeks, required days in the office each week and full time in the office are among the models vying for standardization, acceptance and talent in the corporate workforce.

Fluctuating expectations have created a low but constant drumbeat of anxiety for mid-career professionals with children, aging parents and long commutes. Meanwhile, Gen Z, the next wave of the corporate workforce, naturally assumes a whole new level of agency and flexibility when it comes to work-life balance and preferred practices, even in their first or second jobs.

The third annual EY Future Workplace Index, a national research survey of C-suite corporate leaders conducted by Ernst & Young LLP (EY US), offers an eye-opening window into the ongoing evolution of the workplace and real estate during the past year. Perhaps most remarkable, is that the number of EY US survey respondents reporting nearly full-time remote work has plummeted from 34% in 2022 to 1% in 2023.

The move away from full-time remote work is welcome news for the corporate real estate sector, which is aiming for growth in both the demand for office space and its utilization. It’s worth noting that based on survey respondent feedback, over the past 24 months, smaller companies increased their office space, while larger organizations maintained or reduced their footprint but enhanced the quality of their space, technology and amenities. Optimization of space and time leads company leadership priorities.

“This warming trend toward the physical office is positive for businesses across sectors and employees spanning a range of roles,” says Francisco J. Acoba, MCR, SLCR, EY Americas Co-Lead, Corporate Real Estate Consulting and Technology. “Dark offices can create unintended doubts and uncertainty for both the workforce and the marketplace, even while all that cost is still being absorbed by corporate budgets. We’ve learned a lot in the past three years about productive ways of working, and it’s becoming clear that most workplace models benefit from keeping the office lights on.”

Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer visits an on-shore wind farm near Grimsby in Lincolnshire. Picture date: Thursday November 10, 2022.

Keir Starmer made generating economic growth the heart of his pitch to voters when he launched Labour’s manifesto today.

Whether his plan to boost growth is sufficient is the critical question for UK economy watchers.

Before turning to his plan for growth, it is worth acknowledging (again) the fiscal position. It has been said a million times, but it bears repeating. Labour has essentially signed up to the same spending package as the Conservatives, a package in which unprotected departments are facing spending cuts worth around £20bn.

These departments are already struggling. To avoid these cuts, and meet the fiscal rules, Labour will have to raise taxes. That much is certain.

Even Labour know it. They have committed not to raise income tax, VAT or National Insurance, but on any other tax, the response is that there are “no plans” to increase rates further.

Read more The UK economy beat all but one of its G7 peers on this metric last year

Keir Starmer’s plan is to generate enough economic growth over the coming months that these difficult choices will disappear. Pat McFadden, Labour’s national campaign coordinator, said a plan for economic growth had been the “missing piece in this election debate so far”.

But Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), pointed out that “growth would take time to arrive, and its scale is uncertain”.

No matter what you think of him, few think Starmer will be able to engineer a huge economic recovery in a matter of months simply by being elected.

If this miraculous recovery fails to arrive, then taxes will go up. That’s not economics, that’s arithmetic.

Looking at the longer term, though, Starmer is right. The economy needs to grow to avoid a continuing increase in the tax burden to pay for an ageing population. Once you’ve accepted that taxes will go up after the election – as nearly everyone has – the real question is whether Starmer has a convincing plan to get the economy growing again.

Here, there are some genuinely encouraging signs.

Reflecting the tight government finances, Labour’s plans revolve a lot around working with businesses. This means providing a clear direction, some policy stability, and a little bit of cash to encourage private sector investment.

The emphasis on business investment is welcome. The UK has fallen behind other rich economies in terms of business investment, something which has only gotten worse since Brexit. Investment is crucial for generating economic growth.

Source: IPPR

Labour has promised to use “every available lever” to encourage business investment, and fortunately, some of those levers look relatively easy to pull.

On the most basic level, the party promised to provide a “stable policy environment”, giving investors some certainty on the direction of travel. Similarly, it pledged to “end short-term policy making” through the establishment of an Industrial Strategy Council. This is just good governance.

One of the other major obstacles Labour identified is planning. “The current planning regime

acts as a major brake on economic growth,” the manifesto said.

“We will set out new national policy statements, make major projects faster and cheaper by slashing red tape, and build support for developments by ensuring communities directly benefit. We will also update national planning policy to ensure the planning system meets the needs of a modern economy, making it easier to build laboratories, digital infrastructure, and gigafactories.”

The details are sparse and there will no doubt be complications along the way but the direction of travel is clear enough. And while many governments have set out to reform the planning regime, few will enter Downing Street with the sort of majority Starmer will soon enjoy.

In short, Starmer is not being honest about tax, but there are reasons to remain hopeful when it comes to economic growth. To be successful, he will need to set out a clear plan of action early. The manifesto is a good start, but its only a start.",planning office expansion
526,Getting Started | Building an Application with Spring Boot,https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot,,"You will want to add a test for the endpoint you added, and Spring Test provides some machinery for that.

If you use Gradle, add the following dependency to your build.gradle file:

testImplementation('org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test')

If you use Maven, add the following to your pom.xml file:

<dependency> <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId> <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId> <scope>test</scope> </dependency>

Now write a simple unit test that mocks the servlet request and response through your endpoint, as the following listing (from src/test/java/com/example/springboot/HelloControllerTest.java ) shows:

package com.example.springboot; import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.equalTo; import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.content; import static org.springframework.test.web.servlet.result.MockMvcResultMatchers.status; import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.boot.test.autoconfigure.web.servlet.AutoConfigureMockMvc; import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest; import org.springframework.http.MediaType; import org.springframework.test.web.servlet.MockMvc; import org.springframework.test.web.servlet.request.MockMvcRequestBuilders; @SpringBootTest @AutoConfigureMockMvc public class HelloControllerTest { @Autowired private MockMvc mvc; @Test public void getHello() throws Exception { mvc.perform(MockMvcRequestBuilders.get(""/"").accept(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)) .andExpect(status().isOk()) .andExpect(content().string(equalTo(""Greetings from Spring Boot!""))); } }

MockMvc comes from Spring Test and lets you, through a set of convenient builder classes, send HTTP requests into the DispatcherServlet and make assertions about the result. Note the use of @AutoConfigureMockMvc and @SpringBootTest to inject a MockMvc instance. Having used @SpringBootTest , we are asking for the whole application context to be created. An alternative would be to ask Spring Boot to create only the web layers of the context by using @WebMvcTest . In either case, Spring Boot automatically tries to locate the main application class of your application, but you can override it or narrow it down if you want to build something different.

As well as mocking the HTTP request cycle, you can also use Spring Boot to write a simple full-stack integration test. For example, instead of (or as well as) the mock test shown earlier, we could create the following test (from src/test/java/com/example/springboot/HelloControllerIT.java ):

package com.example.springboot; import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test; import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired; import org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest; import org.springframework.boot.test.web.client.TestRestTemplate; import org.springframework.http.ResponseEntity; import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat; @SpringBootTest(webEnvironment = SpringBootTest.WebEnvironment.RANDOM_PORT) public class HelloControllerIT { @Autowired private TestRestTemplate template; @Test public void getHello() throws Exception { ResponseEntity<String> response = template.getForEntity(""/"", String.class); assertThat(response.getBody()).isEqualTo(""Greetings from Spring Boot!""); } }",plans to open new headquarters
403,Git - Create a Branch From Another Branch,https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git-create-a-branch-from-another-branch/,16 мая 2024 г.,"Branching in Git allows developers to work on isolated features or fixes without affecting the main codebase. However, what if you need to create a new branch based on the changes in another branch? That’s where the concept of branching from another branch comes into play. In this guide, we’ll see the process of creating a branch from another branch in Git.

What is Git?

Git is distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.

Git is designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

It allows multiple developers to work on the same codebase concurrently.

Git stores data in a series of snapshots, which represent the state of the code at a specific point in time.

Branching in Git

Before creating branches from other branches, let’s quickly recap the basics of Git branching:

Master Branch : The master branch typically represents the main codebase, stable and production-ready.

Feature Branches : Developers create feature branches to work on specific features or fixes. These branches are typically created from the master branch.

Merge and Rebase : Once work on a feature branch is complete, changes are merged back into the master branch using either merge or rebase strategies.

Why Create a Branch from Another Branch?

While the master branch serves as the primary branch for stable code, there are scenarios where creating a branch from another branch becomes necessary:

Parallel Development : When multiple developers are working on related features, they might create feature branches from a common development branch rather than directly from the master branch. Code Isolation : Sometimes, you need to isolate changes in a separate branch to test or experiment with them before merging into the main codebase.

Steps to Create a Branch From Another Branch

Step 1: Ensure that you have checked out the branch from which you want to create the new branch. You can use the git checkout command to switch to the branch.

git checkout existing-branch

Step 2: Use the git branch command to create a new branch.

git branch new-branch

Step 3: Switch to the new branch using the git checkout command.

git checkout new-branch

Step 4: Make changes to the new branch as needed. You can commit your changes to the new branch using the git commit command.

git commit -m ""Commit message""

Step 5: If you want to push the new branch to a remote repository, use the git push command.

git push -u origin new-branch

Example

Step 1: Open Git Bash.

Step 2: Navigate to Git Directory.

Step 3: Create a Branch and Switch to it.

Step 4: View Branch List.

Step 5: Switch Branch

Working with Git Branches

In Git, a branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.

Let's say you have a large project, and you need to update the design on it.

How would that work without and with Git:

Without Git:

Make copies of all the relevant files to avoid impacting the live version

Start working with the design and find that code depend on code in other files, that also need to be changed!

Make copies of the dependant files as well. Making sure that every file dependency references the correct file name

EMERGENCY! There is an unrelated error somewhere else in the project that needs to be fixed ASAP!

Save all your files, making a note of the names of the copies you were working on

Work on the unrelated error and update the code to fix it

Go back to the design, and finish the work there

Copy the code or rename the files, so the updated design is on the live version

(2 weeks later, you realize that the unrelated error was not fixed in the new design version because you copied the files before the fix)

With Git:

With a new branch called new-design, edit the code directly without impacting the main branch

EMERGENCY! There is an unrelated error somewhere else in the project that needs to be fixed ASAP!

Create a new branch from the main project called small-error-fix

Fix the unrelated error and merge the small-error-fix branch with the main branch

You go back to the new-design branch, and finish the work there

Merge the new-design branch with main (getting alerted to the small error fix that you were missing)

Branches allow you to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch.

When the work is complete, a branch can be merged with the main project.

You can even switch between branches and work on different projects without them interfering with each other.

Branching in Git is very lightweight and fast!

New Git Branch

Let add some new features to our index.html page.

We are working in our local repository, and we do not want to disturb or possibly wreck the main project.

So we create a new branch :

Example git branch hello-world-images

Now we created a new branch called "" hello-world-images ""

Let's confirm that we have created a new branch :

Example git branch hello-world-images * master

We can see the new branch with the name ""hello-world-images"", but the * beside master specifies that we are currently on that branch .

checkout is the command used to check out a branch . Moving us from the current branch , to the one specified at the end of the command:

Example git checkout hello-world-images Switched to branch 'hello-world-images'

Now we have moved our current workspace from the master branch, to the new branch

Open your favourite editor and make some changes.

For this example, we added an image (img_hello_world.jpg) to the working folder and a line of code in the index.html file:

Example <!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

<title>Hello World!</title>

<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""bluestyle.css"">

</head>

<body>



<h1>Hello world!</h1>

<div><img src=""img_hello_world.jpg"" alt=""Hello World from Space""

style=""width:100%;max-width:960px""></div>

<p>This is the first file in my new Git Repo.</p>

<p>A new line in our file!</p>



</body>

</html>

We have made changes to a file and added a new file in the working directory (same directory as the main branch ).

Now check the status of the current branch :

Example git status On branch hello-world-images Changes not staged for commit: (use ""git add <file>..."" to update what will be committed) (use ""git restore <file>..."" to discard changes in working directory) modified: index.html Untracked files: (use ""git add <file>..."" to include in what will be committed) img_hello_world.jpg no changes added to commit (use ""git add"" and/or ""git commit -a"")

So let's go through what happens here:

There are changes to our index.html, but the file is not staged for commit

img_hello_world.jpg is not tracked

So we need to add both files to the Staging Environment for this branch :

Example git add --all

Using --all instead of individual filenames will Stage all changed (new, modified, and deleted) files.

Check the status of the branch :

Example git status On branch hello-world-images Changes to be committed: (use ""git restore --staged <file>..."" to unstage) new file: img_hello_world.jpg modified: index.html

We are happy with our changes. So we will commit them to the branch :

Example git commit -m ""Added image to Hello World"" [hello-world-images 0312c55] Added image to Hello World 2 files changed, 1 insertion(+) create mode 100644 img_hello_world.jpg

Now we have a new branch , that is different from the master branch .

Note: Using the -b option on checkout will create a new branch, and move to it, if it does not exist

Switching Between Branches

Now let's see just how quick and easy it is to work with different branches, and how well it works.

We are currently on the branch hello-world-images . We added an image to this branch, so let's list the files in the current directory:

Example ls README.md bluestyle.css img_hello_world.jpg index.html

We can see the new file img_hello_world.jpg , and if we open the html file, we can see the code has been altered. All is as it should be.

Now, let's see what happens when we change branch to master

Example git checkout master Switched to branch 'master'

The new image is not a part of this branch. List the files in the current directory again:

Example ls README.md bluestyle.css index.html

img_hello_world.jpg is no longer there! And if we open the html file, we can see the code reverted to what it was before the alteration.

See how easy it is to work with branches? And how this allows you to work on different things?

Emergency Branch

Now imagine that we are not yet done with hello-world-images, but we need to fix an error on master.

I don't want to mess with master directly, and I do not want to mess with hello-world-images, since it is not done yet.

So we create a new branch to deal with the emergency:

Example git checkout -b emergency-fix Switched to a new branch 'emergency-fix'

Now we have created a new branch from master, and changed to it. We can safely fix the error without disturbing the other branches.

Let's fix our imaginary error:

Example <!DOCTYPE html>

<html>

<head>

<title>Hello World!</title>

<link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""bluestyle.css"">

</head>

<body>



<h1>Hello world!</h1>

<p>This is the first file in my new Git Repo.</p>

<p>This line is here to show how merging works.</p>



</body>

</html>

We have made changes in this file, and we need to get those changes to the master branch.

Check the status:

Example git status On branch emergency-fix Changes not staged for commit: (use ""git add <file>..."" to update what will be committed) (use ""git restore <file>..."" to discard changes in working directory) modified: index.html no changes added to commit (use ""git add"" and/or ""git commit -a"")

stage the file, and commit:

Example git add index.html git commit -m ""updated index.html with emergency fix"" [emergency-fix dfa79db] updated index.html with emergency fix 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)

Now we have a fix ready for master, and we need to merge the two branches.",planning to open new branch
409,Git Branch - How to Branch | Learn Git,https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/branch,,"Among its many features, branching in Git stands out as a powerful technique that allows developers to work on multiple tasks simultaneously, experiment with new features, and maintain a clean codebase.

In this article, we’ll delve into the essentials of branching in Git, dispel common myths, and guide you through the process using both the command line and the user-friendly GitKraken Git client.

What is a Git Branch?

Contrary to popular belief, a Git branch is not a collection of commits; rather, it’s a pointer to a specific commit. But what exactly does a Git Branch do?

As you commit changes, the branch pointer moves forward, keeping track of the latest commit. The branch graph diverges only when a commit diverges from a common ancestor.

The Git branching model is lightweight, distinguishing it from other version control systems. Its flexibility allows developers to work on isolated features without affecting the main codebase.

This model safeguards against merging unstable code and provides the opportunity to tidy up the commit history before integrating changes into the main branch.

Creating New Branches in Git

If you want to create a Git branch using the terminal, you can use the git branch command, followed by your desired branch name. This will create a Git branch on your currently checked-out reference.

Learn more about how to create a branch in Git, including how to use one command to create and checkout your new branch simultaneously. By creating branches from specific commits, developers can experiment with new ideas while preserving the main branch’s stability.

How to Rename a Branch in Git

Renaming Git branches is a common practice in software development. To rename a local branch, you can utilize the git branch -m command. If you need to rename a remote branch, the process involves pushing the new name upstream.

This ensures that your branch names accurately reflect the purpose of your work, making project management more organized.

How to Delete a Git Branch

Deleting branches that have served their purpose is essential to maintain a clean repository. When it comes to local branches, the git branch -d command allows you to remove them.

For remote branches, the process differs, involving the use of the git push command. GitKraken Client’s user-friendly interface simplifies the task of both renaming and deleting branches, promoting smoother collaboration and improved project visibility.

Switching Between Branches

As projects grow, developers frequently find themselves switching between branches to work on different features. The git checkout command facilitates seamless transitions between branches. This capability is essential for managing concurrent tasks efficiently.

It’s much easier to understand the fundamentals of branching in Git when you have a visual representation of your history.

360,Glossary of Zoning Terms - DCP,https://www.nyc.gov/site/planning/zoning/glossary.page,,"Accessory Use*

An accessory use is a use that is incidental to and cus­tomarily found in connection with the principal use. An accessory use must be conducted on the same zoning lot as the principal use to which it is related, unless the dis­trict regulations permit another location for the accessory use. (Off-site accessory parking facilities, for example, are permitted in certain zoning districts.)

As-of-right Development

An as-of-right development complies with all applicable zoning regulations and does not require any discretion­ary action by the City Planning Commission or Board of Standards and Appeals. Most developments and enlargements in the city are as-of-right.

Attic Allowance

Attic Allowance An attic allowance is an increase of up to 20 percent in the maximum floor area ratio (FAR) for the provision of a pitched roof. The allowance is available in R2X districts and all R3 and R4 (except R4B) districts. Attic Allowance in Lower Density Growth Management Areas Outside of Lower Density Growth Management Areas (LDGMA), the increased floor area must be directly beneath the pitched roof and have a ceiling height between five and eight feet.

Authorization

An authorization is a discretionary action taken by the City Planning Commission, often after an informal referral to the affected community board(s), which modifies specified zoning requirements if certain findings have been met.

Base Height

The base height of a building is the maximum permitted height of the front wall of a building before any required setback. A building is required to meet a minimum base height only when the height of the building will exceed the maximum base height.

Base Plane*

The base plane is a horizontal plane from which the height of a building is measured. It is utilized in most lower-density and contextual districts, and for property subject to waterfront zoning. Often, the base plane is at curb level; on sites that slope upwards or downwards from a street, or on large lots where buildings are far from a street, the base plane is adjusted to more accurately reflect the level at which the building meets the ground.

A basement is a building story that has at least one-half of its floor-to-ceiling height above curb level or the base plane. By contrast, a cellar has at least one-half of its floor-to-ceiling height below curb level or the base plane. A basement is included in floor area calculations.

Bioswale

A bioswale is a landscape element designed to capture storm water run-off from adjacent surface areas. It has inverted sloped sides that allow rainwater to drain into it and contains vegetation and mulch designed to remove pollutants before the water infiltrates into the soil. They are required in certain parking lots accessory to commer­cial and community facility uses.

A block is a tract of land bounded on all sides by streets or by a combination of streets, public parks, railroad rights-of-way, pierhead lines or airport boundaries.

Blockfront

A blockfront is that portion of a block consisting of all of the zoning lots fronting on a single street.

Board of Standards and Appeals (BSA)

The BSA, composed of five commissioners appointed by the Mayor, reviews and grants applications for special permits, as prescribed in the Zoning Resolution, for certain proposed developments and uses. The BSA also grants variances for zoning lots with irregular physical conditions where construction might not otherwise be possible. In addition, the Board hears and decides appeals to determinations by the Department of Buildings.

A building is a structure that has one or more floors and a roof, is permanently affixed to the land and is bounded by open areas or the lot lines of a zoning lot. attached building* abuts two side lot lines or is one of a row of abutting buildings. Anabuts two side lot lines or is one of a row of abutting buildings. A detached building* is a freestanding building that does not abut any other building and where all sides of the building are surrounded by yards or open areas within the zoning lot. semi-detached building* is a building that abuts or shares a wall, on a side lot line, with another building on an adjoining zoning lot and where the remaining sides of the building are surrounded by open areas or street lines. * is a building that abuts or shares a wall, on a side lot line, with another building on an adjoining zoning lot and where the remaining sides of the building are surrounded by open areas or street lines. zero lot line building* is a freestanding building that abuts one side lot line of a zoning lot and does not abut any other building on an adjoining zoning lot. * is a freestanding building that abuts one side lot line of a zoning lot and does not abut any other building on an adjoining zoning lot.

Building Envelope

A building envelope is the maximum three-dimensional space on a zoning lot within which a structure can be built, as permitted by applicable height, setback and yard controls.

Building Height

Building height refers to a building’s elevation as measured from the curb level or base plane to the roof of the building (except for permitted obstructions, such as elevator bulkheads).

Building Segment*

A building segment is a portion of a building where each portion has one or more dwelling units served by a sepa­rate entrance. For example, a row of attached townhouses is comprised of building segments.

Bulk

Bulk regulations are the combination of controls (lot size, floor area ratio, lot coverage, open space, yards, height and setback) that determine the maximum size and placement of a building on a zoning lot.

Bulkhead

A bulkhead is an enclosed structure on the roof of a build­ing that may include mechanical equipment, water tanks and roof access from interior stairwells. It is not counted as floor area and is permitted to exceed zoning height and setback requirements, within limits specified in the Zoning Resolution.

Cellar

A cellar is a level of a building that has at least one-half of its floor-to-ceiling height below curb level or the base plane. By contrast, a basement has at least one-half of its floor-to-ceiling height above curb level or the base plane. A cellar is not included in floor area calculations.

Certification

A certification is a non-discretionary action taken by the City Planning Commission, or its Chairperson, informing the Department of Buildings that an as-of-right develop­ment has complied with specific conditions set forth in accordance with provisions of the Zoning Resolution. Certification is also the beginning of the ULURP process indicating that the Department of City Planning has determined that an application is complete and ready for formal public review.

City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR)

Pursuant to state law, the City Environmental Quality Review (CEQR) process identifies and assesses the potential environmental impacts of discretionary actions that are proposed by public or private applicants. A discretionary action, such as a zoning map amendment, cannot begin public review until a “conditional negative declaration” or “negative declaration” has been issued, stating that no significant environmental impacts have been identified or, if any potential impacts have been identified, a draft environmental impact statement has been completed, evaluating the significance of identified impacts and proposing appropriate mitigation. A letter “E” designation assigned to a zoning lot indicates a site where environmental requirements must be satisfied before a building permit may be issued for any develop­ment, enlargement or change of use.

City Map

The City Map is a collection of maps that show legal streets, grades, parks, pierhead and bulkhead lines, public places and other legally established map elements. It is the official map of New York City and is the base for the zoning maps in the Zoning Resolution. The office of each borough president contains the city maps for that borough.

City Planning Commission

The City Planning Commission, established in 1936, is a 13-member panel responsible for the conduct of planning relating to the orderly growth and development of the city. The Commission meets regularly to hold public hearings and review and vote on applications related to the use and improvement of land, subject to city regulation and a con­sideration of environmental impacts. The Mayor appoints the Chairperson, who is also Director of the Department of City Planning (DCP), and six other members; each Borough President appoints one member and one member is appointed by the Public Advocate. The DCP provides technical support for the work of the Commission.

Commercial Building*

A commercial building is any building occupied only by commercial uses, as listed in Use Groups 5 through 16.

Commercial District*

A commercial district, designated by the letter C (C1-2, C3, C4-7, for example), is a zoning district in which com­mercial uses are allowed. Residential and community facility uses may also be permitted.

Commercial Overlay

A commercial overlay is a C1 or C2 district mapped within residential districts to serve local retail needs (grocery stores, dry cleaners, restaurants, for example). Commercial overlay districts, designated by the letters C1-1 through C1-5 and C2-1 through C2-5, are shown on the zoning maps as a pattern superimposed on a residential district. Unless otherwise specified on the zoning maps, the depth of C1 overlay districts, measured from the nearest street, is 200 feet for C1-1 districts, 150 feet for C1-2, C1-3, C2-1, C2-2 and C2-3 districts, and 100 feet for C1-4, C1-5, C2-4 and C2-5 districts. When mapped on the long dimension of a block, commercial overlays extend to the midpoint of that block.

Commercial Use

A commercial use is any retail, service or office use listed in Use Groups 5 through 16, or allowed by special permit.

Community District (CD)

New York City is organized into 59 community districts. Each CD is represented by a Community Board, composed of volunteer community members appointed by the Borough President, that assist neighborhood residents and advise on neighborhood and citywide planning and service issues.

Community Facility Building

A community facility building is any building occupied only by a community facility use(s).

Community Facility Use

A community facility use provides educational, health, recreational, religious or other essential services for the community it serves. Community facility uses are listed in Use Groups 3 and 4.

Contextual Zoning

Contextual zoning regulates the height and bulk of new buildings, their setback from the street line, and their width along the street frontage, to produce buildings that are consistent with existing neighborhood character. Residential and commercial districts with an A, B, D or X suffix are contextual zoning districts.

Conversion

A conversion is a change of a building’s use to another use.

Court

A court is any open area, other than a yard or a portion of a yard, which is unobstructed from its lowest level to the sky, and is bounded by building walls, or building walls and one or more lot lines.

Curb Cut

A curb cut is an angled cut in the edge of a curb that permits vehicular access from a street to a driveway, garage, parking lot or loading dock. In residential districts, width and spacing rules for curb cuts ensure adequate curbside parking.

Curb Level

Curb level is the mean level of the curb adjoining a zon­ing lot. In general, it is the basis for building height and setback controls in medium- and higher-density non-contextual districts and manufacturing districts.

Density

Density refers to the maximum number of dwelling units permitted on a zoning lot. The factors for each district are approximations of average unit size plus allowances for any common areas. Special density regulations apply to mixed buildings that contain both residential and community facility uses.

Detached Building* ( see Building)

Development

A development includes the construction of a new build­ing or other structure on a zoning lot, the relocation of an existing building to another zoning lot, or the establish­ment of a new open use on a tract of land.

Development Rights

Development rights generally refer to the maximum amount of floor area permissible on a zoning lot. When the actual built floor area is less than the maximum per­mitted floor area, the difference is referred to as “unused development rights.” Unused development rights are often described as air rights. A zoning lot merger is the joining of two or more adjacent zoning lots into one new zoning lot. Unused development rights may be shifted from one lot to an­other, as-of-right, only through a zoning lot merger. is the joining of two or more adjacent zoning lots into one new zoning lot. Unused development rights may be shifted from one lot to an­other, as-of-right, only through a zoning lot merger. A transfer of development rights (TDR) allows for the transfer of unused development rights from one zoning lot to another in limited circumstances, usually to promote the preservation of historic build­ings, open space or unique cultural resources. For such purposes, a TDR may be permitted where the transfer could not be accomplished through a zon­ing lot merger. In the case of a landmark building, for example, a transfer may be made by CPC special permit from the zoning lot containing the designated landmark to an adjacent zoning lot or one that is directly across a street or, for a corner lot, another corner lot on the same intersection.

Discretionary Action

A discretionary action requires the review and approval of the City Planning Commission or the Board of Standards and Appeals. Zoning amendments, special permits, authorizations and variances are discretionary actions.

Docket

A docket is the Department of City Planning's official description of a proposed land-use action. The docket description is incorporated in the Commission's and City Council's resolution of approval and, except for City Map actions, is the legal and binding description of the action.

Dormer

A dormer is a permitted obstruction within a required setback area that may exceed the height of a building. In lower-density districts, it is often a window protruding from a sloped roof to provide light and air to the top floors of homes. In R6 through R10 contextual districts, dormers are portions of buildings allowed to penetrate a required setback above the maximum base height in order to provide variety to the base heights of buildings along a street. Both types of dormers are subject to size limitations.

Dwelling Unit

A dwelling unit consists of one or more rooms that con­tain lawful cooking and sanitary facilities, inhabited by one or more persons living together and maintaining a common household, in a residential building or residential portion of a building.

Enlargement

Extension

An extension is an expansion of the existing floor area occupied by an existing use.

Fence

In residential districts, the maximum height of a fence constructed along a front lot line is four feet above ground level. The maximum height of a fence along the side or rear lot line is six feet. In most instances, fences are considered permitted obstructions.

Floor Area

The floor area of a building is the sum of the gross area of each floor of the building, excluding mechanical space, cellar space, floor space in open balconies, elevators or stair bulkheads and, in most zoning districts, floor space used for accessory parking that is located less than 23 feet above curb level.

Floor Area Ratio (FAR)

The floor area ratio is the principal bulk regulation controlling the size of buildings. FAR is the ratio of total building floor area to the area of its zoning lot. Each zoning district has an FAR which, when multiplied by the lot area of the zoning lot, produces the maximum amount of floor area allowable on that zoning lot. For example, on a 10,000 square foot zoning lot in a district with a maximum FAR of 1.0, the floor area on the zoning lot cannot exceed 10,000 square feet.

FRESH Food Store*

A FRESH food store is a full-line grocery store, established in underserved neighborhoods through zoning incentives, that promotes the sale of fresh food products.

Front Yard Line*

A front yard line is a line drawn parallel to the front lot line at the depth of a required front yard.

Group Parking Facility

A group parking facility is a building, structure or lot used for parking that serves more than one dwelling unit.

Height Factor

The height factor of a building is equal to the total floor area of the building divided by its lot coverage (in square feet). In general, the height factor is equal to the number of stories in a building constructed without setbacks.

Height Factor Building

A height factor building is a building containing residences whose residential bulk is determined by a complementary range of height factors, floor area ratios and open space ratios, and is set within a sky exposure plane. Height factor regulations promote tall buildings surrounded by open space. Height factor buildings are permitted only in R6 through R9 non-contextual districts.

Home Occupation

A home occupation is a business operated by the occupant(s) of a dwelling unit, which is accessory to the residential use. It is generally restricted to no more than 25 percent of the floor area of the dwelling unit (500 sq ft maximum). Occupations that may generate excessive noise, odors or pedestrian traffic are not permitted.

Incentive Zoning

Incentive zoning provides a bonus, usually in the form of additional floor area, in exchange for the provision of a public amenity or affordable housing. There are incentive bonuses for the provision of public plazas (privately owned public spaces), visual or performing arts spaces, subway improvements, theater preservation, FRESH food stores and affordable housing (Inclusionary Housing Program).

Inclusionary Housing Program

The Inclusionary Housing Program provides two optional floor area incentives in exchange for the creation or preservation of affordable housing, on or off-site, pre­dominantly for low-income households. The original R10 Program provides a floor area bonus of up to 20 percent, increasing the maximum FAR of 10.0 to 12.0 for the provision of affordable housing in applicable residential and commercial districts with R10 density. In Inclusionary Housing designated areas* mapped in medium- and high-density residential neighbor­hoods and commercial districts with equivalent den­sity, a bonus of 33 percent of floor area can be obtained for providing 20 percent as affordable housing. The base FAR in designated areas is, in most cases, lower than the maximum FAR allowed in the same zoning district located outside a designated area.

Income-restricted Housing Unit

A dwelling unit that complies with the definition of an affordable housing unit under one of the Inclusionary Housing Programs, or any other dwelling unit with a legally binding restriction on household income at or below 80 percent of Area Median Income.

Joint Living-Work Quarters for Artists*

Joint living-work quarters for artists are spaces in non­residential buildings used for living quarters and work space by artists and their households.

Large Scale Development

A large-scale development is a development generally involving several zoning lots planned as a unit. Large-scale development regulations allow modifications to various zoning regulations, such as the distribution of floor area without regard to zoning lot lines, by CPC discretionary action. Such modifications can allow for design flexibility to achieve a superior site plan. A large-scale general development* is a development or enlargement for any uses permitted by the underlying district regulations in commercial districts (except C1, C2, C3 and C4-1 districts) and in all manufacturing districts. The development must be on a tract of land that is at least 1.5 acres and may include existing buildings. A large-scale residential development* is a devel­opment designed predominantly for residential uses in residence districts and in C1, C2, C3 and C4-1 districts. The development must be on a tract of land that is either at least three acres (130,680 sq ft) with a minimum of 500 dwelling units or at least 1.5 acres (65,340 sq ft) with a minimum of three principal resi­dential buildings. Existing buildings may not form any part of a large-scale residential development. A large-scale community facility development * is a development or enlargement predominantly for com­munity facility uses in residential districts and in C1, C2, C3 and C4-1 districts. The development must be on a tract of land that is at least three acres (130,680 sq ft) and may include existing buildings.

Limited Height District

A limited height district may be superimposed on an area designated as an historic district by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. It is mapped in areas of the Upper East Side, Gramercy Park, Brooklyn Heights and Cobble Hill. The maximum building height is 50 feet in a LH-1 district, 60 feet in a LH-1A district, 70 feet in a LH-2 district and 100 feet in a LH-3 district.

Loft

A loft is a building or space within a building designed for commercial or manufacturing use, generally constructed prior to 1930. In certain manufacturing districts, lofts may be converted to residential use by CPC special permit.

Lot or Zoning Lot

A lot or zoning lot is a tract of land comprising a single tax lot or two or more adjacent tax lots within a block. An apartment building on a single zoning lot, for example, may contain separate condominium units, each occupying its own tax lot. Similarly, a building containing a row of townhouses may occupy several separate tax lots within a single zoning lot, or two or more detached homes on one zoning lot may each have its own tax lot. The zoning lot is the basic unit for zoning regulations and may be subdivided into two or more zoning lots, and two or more adjoining zoning lots on the same block may be merged, provided that all resulting zoning lots comply with applicable regulations. A corner lot* is a zoning lot that adjoins the point of intersection of two or more streets; it is also a zoning lot bounded entirely by streets. An interior lot* is any zoning lot that is neither a corner lot nor a through lot. A through lot* is any zoning lot that connects two generally parallel streets and is not a corner lot.

Lot Area

Lot area is the area (in square feet) of a zoning lot.

Lot Coverage

Lot coverage is that portion of a zoning lot which, when viewed from above, is covered by a building. Permitted obstructions are not counted towards lot coverage calculations.

Lot Depth

Lot depth is the mean horizontal distance between the front lot line and rear lot line of a zoning lot.

Lot Line or Zoning Lot Line

A lot line or a zoning lot line is a boundary of a zoning lot. A front lot line,* also known as a street line, is that portion of a zoning lot line that fronts upon a street. A rear lot line* is any lot line that is generally parallel to a street line bounding the zoning lot and does not intersect a street line. A side lot line* is any lot line that is neither a front lot line nor a rear lot line.

Lot Width

Lot width is the mean horizontal distance between the side lot lines of a zoning lot.

Lower Density Growth Management Area

A Lower Density Growth Management Area is a designated area that is generally distant from mass transit and characterized by rapid growth and high auto ownership, such as Staten Island or the Throgs Neck area of the Bronx. New developments must provide more off-street parking, larger yards and more open space than would otherwise be required in the mapped zoning districts.

Manhattan Core

The Manhattan Core extends from the southern tip of Manhattan at The Battery to West 110th Street on the West Side and East 96th Street on the East Side. It is the area covered by Manhattan Community Districts 1 through 8.

Manufacturing District

A manufacturing district, designated by the letter M (M1-1, M2-2, for example), is a zoning district in which manufacturing uses, most commercial uses and some community facility uses are permitted. Industrial uses are subject to a range of performance standards. Residential development is not allowed, except in M1-1D through M1-5D districts by CPC authorization, and in M1-6D districts, as-of-right or by CPC certification.

Manufacturing Use

A manufacturing use is any use listed in Use Group 17 or 18, or an industrial use only allowed by special permit.

Mixed Building*

A mixed building is a building in a commercial district used partly for residential use and partly for community facility or commercial use. When a building contains more than one use, the maxi­mum FAR permitted on the zoning lot is the highest FAR allowed for any of the uses, provided that the FAR for each use does not exceed the maximum FAR permitted for that use. In a C1-8A district, for example, where the maximum commercial FAR is 2.0 and the maximum residential FAR is 7.52, the total permitted FAR for a mixed residential/commercial building would be 7.52, of which no more than 2.0 FAR may be applied to the commercial space.

Mixed Use District*

A mixed use district is a special purpose district where one set of regulations applies to many different areas shown on the zoning maps as MX with a numerical suffix (MX-8, for example). In MX districts, an M1 district is paired with a residential district (M1-2/R6, for example) and new residential and non-residential uses are permit­ted as-of-right within the same building. In this district, a building that contains a residential use and any other use is a mixed use building.

Non-complying or Non-compliance

A non-complying building is any building that no longer complies with one or more of the bulk regulations of the applicable zoning district. The degree of non-compliance may not be increased. Regulations governing non-com­plying buildings can be found in Article V, Chapter 4, of the Zoning Resolution.

Non-conforming or Non-conformity

A non-conforming use is any use that no longer conforms to one or more of the use regulations of the applicable zoning district. The degree of non-conformance may not be increased. Regulations governing non-conforming uses can be found in Article V, Chapters 2 and 3, of the Zoning Resolution.

Open Space*

Open space is the part of a residential zoning lot (which may include courts or yards) that is open and unob­structed from its lowest level to the sky, except for specific permitted obstructions, and accessible to and usable by all persons occupying dwelling units on the zoning lot. Depending upon the district, the amount of required open space is determined by the open space ratio, minimum yard regulations or by maximum lot coverage.

Open Space Ratio (OSR)

The open space ratio is the amount of open space required on a residential zoning lot in non-contextual districts, expressed as a percentage of the total floor area on the zoning lot. For example, if a building with 20,000 square feet of floor area has an OSR of 20, 4,000 square feet of open space would be required on the zoning lot (0.20 × 20,000 sq ft).

Overlay District

An overlay district is a district superimposed upon another district which supersedes, modifies or supple­ments the underlying regulations. Limited height dis­tricts and commercial overlay districts are examples of overlay districts.

Paired Districts

A paired district matches an M1 district with an R3 through R10 district (M1-5/R10, for example) to permit a mixture of residential and non-residential (commercial, community facility, light manufacturing) uses in the same zoning district, block or building. Paired districts are mapped in Special Mixed Use Districts and in the Special Long Island City Mixed Use District.

Parapet

A parapet is a low wall or protective barrier that extends vertically above the roof of a building or other structure. A parapet wall that is no higher than four feet is a permitted obstruction and may penetrate a maximum height limit or required setback area.

Parking Requirement Category (PRC)

Parking requirements for commercial uses are grouped into nine parking requirement categories based on the compat­ibility of the uses and the amount of traffic generated.

Performance Standard

A performance standard is a minimum requirement or maximum allowable limit on noise, vibration, smoke, odor and other effects of industrial uses listed in Use Groups 17 and 18.

Perimeter Wall

Perimeter walls are the outermost walls of a building in a lower-density district that enclose floor area and rise from the base plane to a specified maximum height.

Permitted Obstruction

A permitted obstruction is a structure or object that may be located in a required yard or open space or pen­etrate a height limit, setback area or sky exposure plane. A balcony, trellis, air conditioner, gutter or fence is a permitted obstruction in required yards or open space. Certain structures on a roof, such as elevator bulkheads, water towers or parapets are permitted obstructions that may penetrate height limits, setback areas or sky exposure planes.

Planting Strips

Planting strips are grassy areas that extend along the edge of the curb within which street trees are planted in R1 through R5 districts. Planting strips are a required streetscape improvement in certain districts.

Predominantly Built-up Area

A predominantly built-up area is a blockfront entirely within an R4 or R5 district (without a suffix) in which optional regulations that permit higher floor area ratios and lower parking requirements may be used to produce infill housing. At least 50 percent of the area of the block must be occupied by zoning lots developed with build­ings, and the zoning lot that will be developed with infill housing may not exceed 1.5 acres (65,340 sq ft). Infill regulations may not be used to redevelop a lot occupied by a one- or two-family detached or semi-detached house unless the blockfront is predominantly developed with attached or multifamily housing.

Private Road

A private road is a right-of-way that gives vehicular access to developments with five or more dwelling units that are located at least 50 feet from a public street in R1 through R5 districts. Developments on private roads must comply with special design rules. In lower density growth management areas, a right-of-­way that provides access to three or more dwelling units is a private road.

Privately-owned Public Space

A privately owned public space is an amenity provided and maintained by the property owner for public use, usually in exchange for additional floor area. Located mainly in the high-density, central business districts of Manhattan, these spaces are typically in the form of an arcade or a public plaza with seating and landscaping and may be located within or outside a building.

Public Park

A public park is any publicly owned park, playground, beach, parkway, or roadway within the jurisdiction and control of the New York City Commissioner of Parks & Recreation. Typically, public parks are not subject to zoning regulations.

Public Parking Garage

A public parking garage is a building or part of a building that is used on a daily basis for public parking. A public parking garage may include some accessory off-street parking spaces for uses on the same zoning lot.

Public Parking Lot

A public parking lot is a tract of land that is used on a daily basis for public parking and is not accessory to a use on the same or another zoning lot.

Public Plaza

A public plaza is a privately owned open area adjacent to a building and accessible to the public. It must generally be at the level of the sidewalk it adjoins and be unobstructed to the sky except for seating and other permitted ameni­ties. In certain high-density zoning districts, a floor area bonus is available for the provision of a public plaza.

Qualifying Ground Floor

A ground floor of a development or enlargement of a Quality Housing building, where the start of the second story is 13 feet or more above the level of the sidewalk and, in certain instances, where additional supplementary use provisions are met. In some zoning districts, buildings with a Qualifying Ground Floor are permitted a higher maximum base and overall height.

Quality Housing Program

The Quality Housing Program, mandatory in contextual R6 through R10 residence districts and optional in non-contextual R6 through R10 districts, encourages develop­ment consistent with the character of many established neighborhoods. Its bulk regulations set height limits and allow high lot coverage buildings that are set at or near the street line. The Quality Housing Program also requires amenities relating to interior space, recreation areas and landscaping.

Railroad or Transit Air Space

Railroad or transit air space is space directly over an open railroad or transit right-of-way or yard in existence on or after September 27, 1962. Development may be permitted only by CPC special permit.

Rear Yard Equivalent (see Yard)

A residence consists of one or more dwelling units or rooming units, and any common areas, including one-family and two-family houses, multifamily dwellings or apartment hotels. A single-family residence* is a building on a zoning lot containing one dwelling unit occupied by one household. A two-family residence* is a building on a zoning lot containing two dwelling units occupied by two households. In R3-1, R3A, R3X, R4-1 and R4A districts, two-family houses, both detached and semi-detached, must have at least 75% of one dwelling unit directly above or below the other. A multifamily residence is a building on a zoning lot containing at least three dwelling units.

Residence District

A residence district, designated by the letter R (R3-2, R5, R10A, for example), is a zoning district in which only residences and community facilities are permitted.

Residential District Equivalent

A residential district equivalent is a residential district designation assigned to a C1, C2, C3, C4, C5 or C6 district that establishes the regulations for residential develop­ment within the district. Any residential development in a C4-4 district, for example, must follow the bulk regula­tions of its residential equivalent, an R7 district.

Residential Use

A residential use is any use listed in Use Group 1 (single-­family detached residences) or Use Group 2 (all other types of residential development).

Restrictive Declaration

A restrictive declaration is a covenant running with the land that binds the present and future owners of the prop­erty. Restrictive declarations are used to implement the conditions of a land use approval or ensure implementation of environmental mitigations and project components.

Rezoning

A rezoning or remapping occurs when the zoning designation(s) for an area is changed on the zoning map to facilitate policy initiatives, such as preserving neigh­borhoods and promoting economic development around transit hubs. A zoning map amendment is subject to the ULURP review process.

Setback, Building

Setbacks, Front Yard or Ground Level

Front yards are required in R1 through R5 districts; rules governing the depth of open areas at ground level between the front building wall and the street line apply in R6 through R10 districts. Front yards and open areas must be planted and have a minimum depth that meets the following requirements: R2A, R3A, R3X, R4A, R4-1 and R5A In R2A, R3A, R3X, R4A, R4-1 and R5A districts, if the adjacent front yards are deeper than the minimum required front yard, a new building must provide a front yard at least as deep as one of the adjacent yards, but it need not be deeper than 20 feet. R4B, R5B and R5D In R4B, R5B and R5D districts, if the adjacent front yards are deeper than the minimum required front yard, then the front yard of a new building must be at least as deep as one adjacent front yard and no deeper than the other, but it need not be deeper than 20 feet. R6B, R7B and R8B In R6B, R7B and R8B districts, the street wall of a new building, on any lot up to 50 feet wide, must be as deep as one adjacent wall and no deeper than the other. On lots wider than 50 feet, the street wall of a new build­ing may be no closer to the street line than the street wall of an adjacent building. A street wall need not be located farther from the street line than 15 feet. R6A, R7A and R7X In R6A, R7A, 7D and R7X districts, the street wall of a new building may be located no closer to the street line than the street wall of any building within 150 feet on the same blockfront, but need not be located farther from the street line than 15 feet.

Side Lot Ribbon

Side Yard* (see Yard)

Sidewalk cafe

A sidewalk cafe is a portion of an eating or drinking estab­lishment that is located on a public sidewalk. Sidewalk cafe regulations are administered by the Department of Consumer Affairs. An enclosed sidewalk cafe* is a sidewalk cafe that is contained within a structure. An unenclosed sidewalk cafe* contains readily remov­able tables, chairs or railings, with no overhead coverage other than umbrellas or a retractable awning. A small sidewalk cafe* is an unenclosed sidewalk cafe containing no more than a single row of tables and chairs in a space no greater than 4½ feet from the street line, with no barrier between the café and the sidewalk.

Sign

A sign is any writing—words, pictures or symbols—that is on or attached to a building or other structure. An accessory sign* directs attention to a business, profession, commodity, service or entertainment con­ducted, sold or offered upon the same zoning lot. An advertising sign* directs attention to a business, profession, commodity, service or entertainment con­ducted, sold or offered on a different zoning lot. A flashing sign* is any illuminated sign, whether stationary, revolving or rotating, which changes light or color. An illuminated sign* uses artificial light or reflected light from an artificial source.

Sketch Maps

A sketch map is an illustration of a proposed change to the Zoning Map or the City Map that provides a graphic, easy to read version of the change. The sketch map is attached to the Notice of Certification (NOC) when an application for a Zoning Map or City Map change is certified as complete by the Department of City Planning and distributed for public review. Sketch maps are limited in scope and scale to include only the area affected by the proposed action and do not necessarily reflect the final action.

Sky Exposure Plane

Sliver Building

A tall building or enlargement that is 45 feet wide or less, in an R7-2, R7X, R8, R9 or R10 district, is commonly called a sliver building. Such buildings are generally restricted to a height equal to the width of the abutting street or 100 feet, whichever is less.

Special Permit

A special permit is a discretionary action by the City Planning Commission (CPC), subject to ULURP review, or the Board of Standards and Appeals (BSA), which may modify use, bulk or parking regulations if certain condi­tions and findings specified in the Zoning Resolution are met. Applications for special permits under CPC jurisdiction generally concern use or bulk modifications with potential for greater land use impacts than those reviewed by the BSA.

Special Purpose District

The regulations for special purpose districts are designed to supplement and modify the underlying zoning in order to respond to distinctive neighborhoods with particular issues and goals. Special purpose districts are shown as overlays on the zoning maps and are in Articles VIII–XIII of the Resolution.

Split Lot

25 Foot Rule

The 25 foot rule applies to an existing zoning lot split between two or more zoning districts that permit different uses or have different bulk rules (C1-9 and R8B, for example). When the width of one district measures 25 feet or less at every point, the use and bulk regulations of the larger district can be applied to the entire zoning lot.

Story

A story is that part of a building between the surface of one floor and the ceiling immediately above. A cellar does not count as a story.

Street

A street is any road (other than a private road), highway, parkway, avenue, alley or other way shown on the City Map, or a way at least 50 feet wide and intended for public use which connects a way shown on the City Map to another such way or to a building or structure. A street refers to the entire public right-of-way (including public sidewalks). A narrow street* is a street that is less than 75 feet wide. A wide street* is a street that is 75 feet or more in width. Most bulk regulations applicable to wide streets are also applicable to buildings on intersecting streets within 100 feet of a wide street.

Street Line*

A street line is a front lot line separating the zoning lot from the street.

Street Wall

A street wall is a wall or portion of a wall of a building facing a street.

Tax Lot

A tax lot is a parcel of land identified with a unique borough, block and lot number for property tax purposes. A zoning lot comprises one or more adjacent tax lots within a block.

Tower

A tower is a portion of a building that penetrates the sky exposure plane and is allowed only in specified high-density areas of the city. A tower may be occupied by residential, commercial or community facility uses. The standard tower rules generally permit the tower portion of a building to cover no more than 40 per­cent of the area of the zoning lot, or up to 50 percent on lots smaller than 20,000 square feet. The tower portion of a building must be set back at least 10 feet from a wide street and at least 15 feet from a narrow street. These regulations are modified for different uses and districts. A tower-on-a-base requires a contextual base be­tween 60 and 85 feet high that extends continuously along the street line. The height of the tower is con­trolled by a minimum lot coverage requirement and a rule that at least 55 percent of the floor area on the zoning lot be located below a height of 150 feet. On a wide street in R9 and R10 districts and their C1 or C2 equivalents, a building that includes a residential tower must comply with tower-on-a-base regulations in addition to the standard tower rules.

Transit Zone

An area where special lower accessory parking requirements apply for various types of affordable housing including income-restricted housing units. These are generally areas of the city beyond the Manhattan Core within one-half mile of a subway station where auto ownership rates are among the lowest in the city.

Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP)

The Uniform Land Use Review Procedure (ULURP) is the public review process, mandated by the City Charter, for all pro­posed zoning map amendments, special permits and other actions such as site selections and acquisitions for city capital projects and disposition of city property. ULURP sets forth a time frame and other requirements for public participation at the Community Board, Borough Board and Borough President levels, and for the public hearings and determinations of the Community Boards, Borough Presidents, City Planning Commission (CPC) and City Council. Zoning text amendments follow a similar review process, but without a time limit for CPC review.

Use

A use is any activity, occupation, business or operation, listed in Use Groups 1 through 18, or identified in a special permit, which is conducted in a building or on a tract of land. Certain uses are allowed only by special permit of the CPC or BSA.

Use Group

Uses that have similar functional characteristics and/or nuisance impacts and are generally compatible with each other are listed in one or more of 18 groups that are cat­egorized as residential uses (Use Groups 1–2), community facility uses (Use Groups 3–4), retail and service uses (Use Groups 5–9), regional commercial centers/amuse­ment uses (Use Groups 10–12), waterfront/recreation uses (Use Groups 13–15), heavy automotive uses (Use Group 16) and industrial uses (Use Groups 17–18). Use group charts can be found in Chapter 2 of Articles II, III and IV of the Zoning Resolution.

Variance

A variance is a discretionary action by the Board of Standards and Appeals which grants relief from the use and bulk provisions of the Zoning Resolution to the extent necessary to permit a reasonable or practical use of the land. A variance may be granted, after a public hearing, when unique conditions on a specific parcel of land would cause the property owner practical difficulty and undue hardship if it were developed pursuant to applicable provisions.

Waterfront Access Plan (WAP)

A waterfront access plan is a detailed framework set forth in the Zoning Resolution, that tailors waterfront bulk regulations and public access requirements to the specific conditions of a particular waterfront. Development of individual waterfront parcels governed by the plan trig­gers a requirement to build and maintain public access areas in accordance with the WAP.

Waterfront Area

A waterfront area is the geographical area adjacent to a body of water at least 100 feet wide, comprising all blocks between the pierhead line and a parallel line 800 feet land­ward from the shoreline. Blocks within the waterfront area are subject to waterfront zoning regulations. The bulkhead line is a line shown on the zoning maps which divides the upland and seaward portions of waterfront zoning lots. The pierhead line is a line shown on the zoning maps which defines the outermost seaward boundary of the area regulated by the Zoning Resolution. The shoreline* is the mean high water line. A waterfront block*, waterfront public park* or waterfront zoning lot* is a block, public park or zoning lot in the waterfront area that is adjacent to or intersected by the shoreline.

Waterfront Public Access Area*

A waterfront public access area (WPAA) is the portion of a waterfront zoning lot where publicly accessible open space is provided to and along the shoreline. All WPAAs are required to be improved with landscaping and trees, seating and other amenities. WPAAs can include a shore public walkway, an upland connection, a supplemental public access area, a public access area on a pier or floating structure, or any additional area improved for public use. The minimum amount of waterfront public access area required is a specified percentage for the zoning lot. A shore public walkway* is a linear public access area running alongside the shore. An upland connection* is a pedestrian way between a public place (a street, a sidewalk or a park, for example) and a shore public walkway. Upland connections may be provided along a private road. A supplemental public access area* is a public access area required in order to fulfill the minimum percent­age of WPAA required on a waterfront zoning lot, once a shore public walkway and upland connection have been provided.

Waterfront Yard*

A waterfront yard is the portion of a waterfront zoning lot extending along the entire length of the shoreline which must be open and unobstructed from the lowest level to the sky, except for certain permitted obstructions. Depending upon the zoning district, the minimum depth is typically 30 to 40 feet. Shore public walkways are required to be located within the waterfront yard.

Window, Legally Required*

Legally required windows are mandated in dwelling units to provide necessary light, air and ventilation. Legally required windows cannot be located on or closer than 30 feet to a lot line.

Yard

A yard is a required open area along the lot lines of a zon­ing lot which must be unobstructed from the lowest level to the sky, except for certain permitted obstructions. Yard regulations ensure light and air between structures. A front yard* extends along the full width of a front lot line. In the case of a corner lot, any yard extending along the full length of a street line is considered a front yard. (See also Setbacks, Front Yard or Ground Level) A rear yard* extends for the full width of a rear lot line. In residential districts, the minimum depth of a rear yard is 30 feet, except in R2X districts. In commercial, manufacturing and R2X districts, the minimum depth of a rear yard is 20 feet. A corner lot is not required to have a rear yard. In commercial and manufacturing districts, and for some community facility buildings in residence districts, the rear yard may be occupied entirely by a single-story building up to a height of 23 feet. A rear yard equivalent* is an open area on a through lot required to comply with rear yard regulations. A side yard* extends along a side lot line from the required front yard, or from the front lot line if no front yard is required, to the required rear yard, or to the rear lot line if no rear yard is required. In the case of a corner lot, any yard that is not a front yard is considered a side yard.

Zero Lot Line Building* (see Building)

Zoning District

A zoning district is a residential, commercial or manufac­turing area of the city within which zoning regulations govern land use and building bulk. Special purpose zoning districts have distinctive qualities where regulations are tailored to the neighborhood. Zoning districts are shown on the zoning maps.

Zoning Lot Merger (see Development Rights)

Zoning Maps

The 126 New York City zoning maps indicate the loca­tion and boundaries of zoning districts and are part of the Zoning Resolution. Each map covers a land area of approximately 8,000 feet (north/south) by 12,500 feet (east/west). Zoning map amendments, or rezonings, are subject to ULURP review.",intends to open new office

Google is expanding in India with its latest lease of ab office in Bengaluru. Google is reported to be leasing 649,000 square feet of office space at Alembic City in Whitefield, Bengaluru. This move, reported by the Economic Times, involves a monthly rental of Rs. 62 per square foot with a three-year lock-in period.

This latest lease in Bengaluru is a continuation of Google's expansion in India. In 2022, Google renewed a rental agreement for 600,000 square feet of office space in Hyderabad. Additionally, the tech giant gets 1.3 million square feet of office space in Bangalore through a deal with Bagmane Developers. These acquisitions reflect a substantial growth in Google's office space portfolio in India, which has expanded by 3.5 million square feet since 2020.

Google Offices In India Google's footprint in India now spans five cities, totalling 9.3 million square feet. This vast presence highlights the importance of the Indian market to Google's global operations. The company is not just expanding its office spaces but also investing in significant local projects. These include plans to manufacture smartphones at a Foxconn facility in Tamil Nadu and initiate independent drone production within the state.

As major IT firms transition back to offline work post-pandemic, there is an expected surge in demand for flexible workspaces. This trend is expected to drive strong absorption rates in the office market over the coming year. Large corporations, including Google, are positioning themselves to take advantage of this demand by securing prime office spaces in key cities.

Google Pixel Local ManufacturingApart from the expansion of Google’s offices in India, the tech giant has plans to start production of its Pixel smartphones in the country, beginning with the Pixel 8 model. Reports also suggest that Google may relocate certain roles to India, aligning with the market's growth. ""India holds priority status for Pixel smartphones, and we're committed to offering the best of our hardware and integrated software capabilities to the people of India,"" Google stated in a recent blog post.",plans to expand office

68,Growth Management Act Overview,https://mrsc.org/explore-topics/planning/gma/growth-management-act-overview,,"Overview

The Growth Management Act (GMA) is a series of state statutes, first adopted in 1990, that requires fast-growing cities and counties to develop a comprehensive plan to manage their population growth. It is primarily codified under Chapter 36.70A RCW, although it has been amended and added to in several other parts of the RCW.

Under RCW 36.70A.020, the GMA establishes a series of 15 goals that should act as the basis of all comprehensive plans. The GMA specifically notes in the statute that the goals ""are not listed in order of priority and shall be used exclusively for the purpose of guiding the development of comprehensive plans and development regulations."" Below you will find a list of those goals along with an abbreviated description (for the full descriptions, see RCW 36.70A.020).

GMA Goals (RCW 36.70A.020) Urban growth. Encourage development in urban areas. Reduce Sprawl. Reduce the inappropriate conversion of undeveloped land. Transportation. Encourage efficient multimodal transportation systems. Housing. Plan for and accommodate housing affordable to all economic segments. Economic development. Encourage economic development throughout the state. Property rights. Private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation having been made. Permits. Applications should be processed in a timely and fair manner. Natural resource industries. Maintain and enhance natural resource-based industries. Open space and recreation. Retain open space, enhance recreational opportunities. Environment. Protect the environment and enhance the state's high quality of life, including air and water quality, and the availability of water. Citizen participation and coordination. Encourage the involvement of citizens. Public facilities and services. Ensure that those public facilities and services necessary to support development shall be adequate. Historic preservation. Identify and encourage preservation. Climate change and resiliency. Ensure that comprehensive plans, development regulations, and regional policies, plans, and strategies adapt to and mitigate the effects of a changing climate. Shoreline management (RCW 36.70A.480)

The Washington State Department of Commerce is the primary state-level contact for GMA-related issues. They provide technical assistance to help local governments comply with the GMA and implement their comprehensive plans effectively.

Who Is Required to Plan Under GMA?

Click map for higher resolution



Based on the requirements in RCW 36.70A.040, 18 counties, and all the cities and towns within them, are required to ""fully plan"" under the GMA. An additional 11 counties had originally opted to fully plan, although one county (Ferry County) later opted out under EHB 1224 (2014), which gave counties under 20,000 population the option to opt out by December 31, 2015. The 28 ""fully planning"" counties make up about 95% of the state's population. Per SB 5457 (2023), RCW 36.70A.130 allows cities with populations under 500 people to fully opt out of comprehensive planning under “some circumstances.”

The 10 counties that opted to “fully plan” must plan according to the same requirements as the fully planning counties. The 11 counties that are not required to “fully plan” must just plan for critical areas and natural resource land only under the GMA.

Comprehensive Plans

The GMA establishes the comprehensive plan as the centerpiece of local long-range planning, which contains a vision, goals, objectives, policies, and implementation actions that are intended to guide day-to-day decisions by elected officials and local government staff. For information on the comprehensive planning process, see our Comprehensive Planning page.

Urban Growth Areas and Accommodating Future Growth

Under the GMA, the state Office of Financial Management (OFM) develops population projections for the state and each county (see OFM's GMA county projections). Each ""fully planning"" county is then mandated to determine, in consultation with cities, where that growth should be directed to occur. Once these growth projections are adopted, then the county and cities are to use them in their comprehensive planning processes and make sure that their plans can accommodate the projected level of growth (RCW 36.70A.115).

This process involves reviewing urban growth areas (UGAs), which are areas where “urban growth shall be encouraged and outside of which growth can occur only if it is not urban in nature” (RCW 36.70A.110). Based on OFM population projections, UGAs and zoning densities within them should be set to accommodate growth that is projected to occur in the county or city over the next 20 years, although they can provide additional capacity to accommodate a “reasonable land market supply factor” (RCW 36.70A.110(2)).

The GMA was amended in 2021 to require that designated cities also identify the capacity and actions needed to accommodate future housing growth within four household income categories (based on U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department guidelines using Average Median Income, or AMI): moderate (80-95% AMI), low (50-80% AMI), very low (30-50%), and extremely low (<30 AMI).

If the UGA review determines that future growth can’t be accommodated within the existing boundaries of the UGA, or the UGA’s developable lands exceeds future growth projects, the UGA may be changed subject to certain requirements such as limitations on floodplain areas and national historic reserves. In 2024, the GMA was amended to allow additional conditions under which UGAs may be revised (SSB 5834). Counties are responsible for designating, expanding, and reducing UGA boundaries, although they are required to consult with the cities in their determinations.

Areas within the UGA but outside city or town boundaries should be addressed by the adjacent city and the county through the county-wide planning policies process. Outside the UGA, cities and towns are limited in the actions they can take regarding those areas. For example, cities are highly limited in their ability to extend utilities and other governmental services outside the UGA (RCW 36.70A.110(4)).

While all ""fully planning"" counties are required to conduct land capacity analyses to ensure their UGAs can accommodate future growth, Clark, King, Kitsap, Pierce, Snohomish, Thurston, and Whatcom counties also have to submit Buildable Lands reports that look back at actual development to determine if cities and counties have designated adequate amounts of residential, commercial, and industrial lands to meet the growth needs incorporated in their comprehensive plans (see Commerce's Buildable Lands page).

For more information on UGAs, see the Department of Commerce’s Urban Growth Area Guidebook (2012).

Natural Resource Lands and Critical Areas

Under the GMA, all cities and counties - even if they are not subject to comprehensive planning - are directed to designate natural resource lands (including those related to forestry, agriculture, fisheries, and mining) and identify steps to preserve them. For more information, see the Department of Commerce's Natural Resource Lands page.

In addition, all cities and counties in Washington are also required to adopt critical areas regulations. As defined in RCW 36.70A.030(6):

""Critical areas"" include the following areas and ecosystems: (a) Wetlands; (b) areas with a critical recharging effect on aquifers used for potable water; (c) fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas; (d) frequently flooded areas; and (e) geologically hazardous areas. ""Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas"" does not include such artificial features or constructs as irrigation delivery systems, irrigation infrastructure, irrigation canals, or drainage ditches that lie within the boundaries of and are maintained by a port district or an irrigation district or company.

In 2023, SSB 5374 amended RCW 36.70A.060 allowing a city of fewer than 25,000 people to adopt their county’s GMA critical area regulations by reference. Counties and cities are required to include the best available science in developing policies and development regulations to protect the functions and values of critical areas (RCW 36.70A.172).

For more information, see our page on Critical Areas and the Department of Commerce's page on Critical Areas, including their useful Critical Areas Handbook (2023).

Growth Management Hearings Board

The Growth Management Hearings Board resolves disputes concerning comprehensive plans and development regulations adopted under the GMA. The board is made up of five members (RCW 36.70A.250)

Challenges to the GMA are heard by a three-member panel comprised of two members residing in the geographic area of a challenge (Eastern Washington, Central Puget Sound, and Western Washington), with one acting as the presiding officer. A third member is drawn from one of the other regions. Each hearing panel must include “a member admitted to practice law in the state,” a former city or county elected official, and must “reflect the political composition of the board” (RCW 36.70A.260).

The governor has the authority to impose sanctions on cities, counties, and state agencies that do not comply with the GMA, as determined by the Growth Management Hearings Board (RCW 36.70A.340-.345). Sanctions may include withholding or temporarily rescinding the authority to collect portions of one or more of the following:

Motor vehicle fuel tax

Transportation improvement account

Rural arterial trust account

Sales and use tax

Liquor profit tax

Liquor excise tax

Real estate excise taxes (REET)

The Growth Management Hearings Board website contains numerous resources, including a handbook (2023) for practicing before the board and digests of decisions (2023).

Moving to a new office space can be an exciting and monumental step in the growth of your company. However, it can also be a complex and daunting task if not planned properly. To ensure a smooth and successful office move, it is crucial to have a well-thought-out plan in place. Keep reading, as we provide you with a comprehensive guide to planning an office move, helping you avoid common pitfalls and minimize disruption to your daily operations.

Create a Moving Committee

Start by assembling a moving committee comprising key members from various departments. This team will act as the guiding force, overseeing the entire moving process and ensuring that all aspects of the move are well-coordinated. Assign specific responsibilities to each member, such as overseeing IT relocation, handling furniture and equipment procurement, and managing communication with external vendors.

Develop a Detailed Timeline

Moving an office involves numerous tasks, both big and small. To ensure everything is completed on time, create a detailed timeline, breaking down the moving process into manageable phases. Identify critical milestones and set specific deadlines for each task, taking into account factors such as lease agreements, communication disruptions, and any downtime associated with technology transitions.

Assess Your New Space

Before moving into your new office, conduct a thorough assessment of the space. Determine how it will accommodate your current and future needs, as well as any necessary renovations or improvements. Consider the layout, floor plan, and overall functionality of the space to ensure it aligns with your business requirements. Additionally, evaluate furniture and equipment needs to ensure a seamless transition.

Communicate with Stakeholders

Communication is key when planning an office move. Notify your employees, clients, vendors, and other stakeholders well in advance to avoid any surprises. Keep them updated throughout the moving process, providing regular reminders, timelines, and contact information. Consider organizing town hall meetings or sending out informative newsletters to address any concerns and answer questions.

Hire Professional Movers

Engaging professional movers is essential to ensure a seamless and stress-free office move. Research and hire a reputable moving company that specializes in office relocations. Obtain quotes from multiple vendors and compare their services and pricing. Verify their insurance coverage and check customer reviews to ensure you choose a reliable and efficient partner who will handle your belongings and equipment with care.

Develop an IT Relocation Plan

Moving your IT infrastructure can be one of the most challenging aspects of an office move. Collaborate with your IT team or external consultants to develop a comprehensive plan. This should include details on dismantling, packing, transferring, and reinstalling all IT equipment, as well as a contingency plan to address any unexpected issues. Ensure that your internet and phone services are seamlessly transitioned to avoid any prolonged downtime.

Update Business Information

Prioritize updating your business information across all platforms, including your website, social media profiles, business directories, and mailing lists. Notify your clients, suppliers, and partners of your new address and contact details. Consider redirecting mail and packages from your old address to the new one to prevent any missed correspondence.

Celebrate and Settle in

After completing your office move, celebrate this exciting milestone with your team. Organize a welcoming event or a small gathering to commemorate the move and acknowledge the collective efforts that made it possible. Take time to familiarize yourself and your employees with the new office space, ensuring everyone feels comfortable and can settle in quickly.

If you must specify a mailbox or suite number: Enter your physical address as ""Address Line 1."" Enter your mailbox or suite number as ""Address Line 2."" If your business rents a physical mailing address but doesn't operate out of that location, also known as a virtual office, that location isn't eligible for a Business Profile. Businesses can't list an office at a co-working space unless that office maintains clear signage, receives customers at the location during business hours, and is staffed during business hours by your business staff.

Do not include information in address lines that doesn't pertain to your business’s physical location, like URLs or keywords.

Do not create more than one page for each location of your business, either in a single account or multiple accounts. Individual practitioners and departments within businesses, universities, hospitals, and government buildings may have separate pages. For more info, go to specific guidelines about individual practitioners and departments.

Businesses showing their address on Google should maintain permanent fixed signage of their business name at the address.

If your address doesn't have a street number, or the system can't find it, you can pin your business's location directly on the map. Service-area businesses Service-area businesses, or businesses that serve customers at their locations, should have one profile for the central office or location with a designated service area. Service-area businesses can't list a ""virtual"" office unless that office is staffed during business hours. Some businesses, like auto repair shops that have a garage for repairs and offer roadside service, are hybrid service-area businesses. These businesses can show their storefront address and designate a service area on their Business Profile. If you serve customers at your address and want to set a service area, your business location should be staffed by your team and able to receive customers during its stated hours. Google determines how best to display your business address based on your business information and information from other sources. Storefront versus service-area businesses If your business doesn’t have a storefront with clear signage but travels to customers at their physical locations, you’re allowed one service-area Business Profile. If you have different locations for your service business, with separate service areas and separate staff at each location, you’re allowed one profile for each location. The boundaries of your profile’s overall service area shouldn’t extend farther than about 2 hours of driving time from where your business is based. For some businesses, larger service areas may be appropriate. Learn more about service-area businesses. If you’re a service-area business, you should hide your business address from customers. For example, if you’re a plumber and run your business from your residential address, clear the address from your Business Profile. Learn how to add or edit your business address.

Provide a phone number that connects to your individual business location, or provide a website that represents your individual business location. Use a local phone number instead of a central call center helpline number whenever possible.

Do not provide phone numbers or URLs that redirect or ""refer"" users to landing pages or phone numbers other than those of the actual business, including pages created on social media sites.

The phone number must be under the direct control of the business.

Additional phone numbers can be used on Google Business Profile websites and other local surfaces.

Premium-rate telephone numbers are not allowed. These phone numbers charge high rates to the caller.

Provide your regular customer-facing hours of operation. If applicable, you may use your current seasonal hours as your regular hours. You may also specify special hours for particular days, like holidays or special events. Certain types of businesses shouldn’t provide hours, including those with varied hours (like schedules for different types of activities, including showtimes, worship services, or classes) and those that operate only by appointment. Examples of business that shouldn’t provide hours include, but aren't limited to: Indoor lodging such as: Hotels, motels, and apartment buildings/complexes

Schools and universities

Movie theaters

Transportation services and airports

Event venues and natural features If your business has departments, provide the business hours for each department on that department’s separate Business Profile, and provide the business hours for the main business on the main Business Profile. Learn about departments. Sets of hours If your business has multiple sets of hours, refer to these guidelines for particular industries: Banks: Use lobby hours if possible. Otherwise, use drive-through hours. An ATM attached to a bank can use its own separate Business Profile with its own, different hours.

Use lobby hours if possible. Otherwise, use drive-through hours. An ATM attached to a bank can use its own separate Business Profile with its own, different hours. Car dealerships: Use car sales hours. If hours for new car sales and pre-owned car sales differ, use the new sales hours.

Use car sales hours. If hours for new car sales and pre-owned car sales differ, use the new sales hours. Gas stations: Use the hours for your gas pumps.

Use the hours for your gas pumps. Restaurants: Use the hours when diners can sit down and dine in your restaurant. Otherwise, use takeout hours. If neither of those is possible, use drive-through hours, or, as a last resort, delivery hours.

Use office hours. Otherwise, use front gate hours. To highlight times for specific services, you can also set More hours. In general, you should set More hours as a subset of your primary hours.

Seasonal hours ​If your business has seasonal hours, use the following guidelines: During the season your business is open, set your regular hours of operation. You may set special hours for holidays, temporary closures, or other events. You can also indicate that your business is open only for a specific seasonal period in your business description.

During off-season, you can mark your business as temporarily closed. Set your regular business hours when your business reopens.



Categories help your customers find accurate, specific results for services they’re interested in. To keep your business information accurate and live, make sure that you: Use as few categories as possible to describe your overall core business from the provided list.

Choose categories that are as specific as possible, but representative of your main business. Do not use categories solely as keywords or to describe attributes of your business. Do not use categories that pertain to other businesses that are nearby or related, such as a business physically contained within your business or an entity that contains your business.

Select your category Select categories that complete the statement: ""This business IS a"" rather than ""this business HAS a."" The goal is to describe your business holistically rather than a list of all the services it offers, products it sells, or amenities it features. Focus primarily on adding the most specific categories for your business; we'll do the rest behind the scenes. For instance, when you select a specific category like ""Golf Resort"", Google implicitly includes more general categories like ""Resort Hotel"", ""Hotel"", and ""Golf Course."" You can skip adding any category that seems redundant with a more specific category you selected. If you can't find a category for your business, choose one that's more general. Google can also detect category information from your website and from mentions about your business throughout the web. Scenario Correct Category Incorrect Category “Papa John’s” offers pizza takeout and delivery but doesn't offer on-premises dining. Pizza Delivery

Hamburger Restaurant Dessert Restaurant If your business contains another business that your organization doesn't own and operate, only use categories that represent your business. Examples: ""Starbucks"" is operated inside ""Barnes and Nobles."" “Starbucks” category: “Coffee Shop” “Barnes and Nobles” category: “Book Store.” It shouldn't add “Coffee Shop” as a category.

""Cardtronics ATM"" is operated inside ""7-Eleven."" “Cardtronics ATM” category: “ATM” “7-Eleven” category: “Convenience Store.” It shouldn't add “ATM” as a category.

""Nobu"" is operated inside ""Hard Rock Hotel."" “Nobu” category: “Restaurant” “Hard Rock Hotel” category: “Hotel.” It shouldn't add “Restaurant” as a category.

The following types of co-located businesses should each have their own profile. If you need to use both categories for the same business location, create two profiles instead. Be sure to use a different name for the second business. Learn about departments. A Restaurant/Cafe/Bar inside of a Hotel/Motel

A Pharmacy inside of a Supermarket/Grocery Store

A Gas Station next to a Supermarket/Grocery Store

There are 2 kinds of menus: A menu for an eating and drinking establishment (like restaurants or cocktail bars) that lists the complete set of food and drink items that are available at the business.

A menu for a service business like a barber, spa, or car repair shop that lists the complete set of services that are available at the business. Both kinds of menu must follow the following guidelines: The menu should be representative of the items and services that are available for customers at the business. Full menus can be meal-specific (like breakfast, lunch, or dinner) and have links to other menu pages. For example, you may choose to link to your business’s dinner menu, which in turn may include links to the breakfast and lunch menus.

Sample menus that only list “popular items” (or similar excerpts) should not be submitted.

Menu URLs can’t be direct links to third-party ordering or delivery services.

Third parties that manage Business Profiles on behalf of clients must notify and have the consent of the business owner to submit a menu URL for a business.

If you run a retail business in an eligible country (US, CA, UK, and IE), you can turn online searchers into in-store shoppers by automatically showcasing your in-store products on your Business Profile. To add your in-store products: Manually upload your products with the Product Editor. Learn how to upload with the Product Editor.

To automatically add your products to your Business Profile, connect your Point of Sale system to the Local Inventory app or product reader. Learn how to add your products to your Business Profile. Both methods must adhere to the following guidelines: Products submitted via Product Editor added automatically must adhere to the Shopping Ads Policy. Learn more about the Shopping Ads Policy.

We do not allow content related to regulated products and services, including alcohol, tobacco products, gambling, financial services, pharmaceuticals and unapproved supplements, or health or medical devices.

Submitting products that violate Google's policy may result in removal of the entire product catalog, including products that aren't in violation.

Guidelines for chains, departments & individual practitioners

Maintain consistent names and categories across all of your business locations to help customers quickly identify your business on Google Maps and search results. All locations must have the same name unless the business’s real world representation consistently varies from location to location. All locations must also have the same category if they provide the same service. Get started with chain Business Profile. Name consistency All business locations within the same country must have the same name for all locations. For example, all Home Depot locations should use the name ""The Home Depot"" rather than ""Home Depot"" or ""The Home Depot at Springfield"". There are 2 exceptions to this policy: If you have multiple types of businesses, sub-brands, multiple departments, or various types of operations such as retail and wholesale, they may also have a distinct name so long as it is consistently applied to all locations of that business. Acceptable name variations: ""Walmart Supercenter"" and ""Walmart Express""; ""Nordstrom"" and ""Nordstrom Rack""; ""Gap"" and ""babyGap""

If some of your locations consistently use a different name on their storefront, website, or stationery, these locations can use this different name. Acceptable name variations: ""Intercontinental Mark Hopkins San Francisco"" and ""Intercontinental New York Barclay""; ""PFK"" (for locations in Quebec) and ""KFC"" (for locations in the US and rest of Canada)

Category consistency All locations of a business must share the one category that best represents the business. If you have multiple types of locations (e.g. sub-brands, multiple departments, or various types of operations such as retail, distribution center, and office), this rule only applies within each of these sub-groups. All ""Gap Kids"" have the category ""Children’s Clothing Store""

All ""Goodyear Auto Service Center"" have the category ""Tire Shop""; they also all have the category ""Auto Repair Shop""

All ""PetSmart"" have the category ""Pet Supply Store""; some locations may have other categories (""Pet Store"", ""Dog Day Care Center"") Two or more brands at the same location If your business location combines two or more brands, do not combine the brand names into a single Business Profile. Instead, pick one brand’s name for the Business Profile. If the brands operate independently, you may use a separate profile for each brand at this location. For multiple virtual food brands at the same location, refer to the food-specific guidelines in the Virtual food brands section below. Not Acceptable: ""KFC / Taco Bell"" or ""Dunkin' Donuts / Baskin Robbins""

""KFC / Taco Bell"" or ""Dunkin' Donuts / Baskin Robbins"" Acceptable: ""Taco Bell"", ""KFC"", ""Dunkin’ Donuts"", ""Baskin Robbins"" If your business sells another business brand’s product(s) or service(s), use only the name of the business, excluding the name of the brand being sold, which can't have a Business Profile for this location. Not Acceptable: ""Staples / UPS"", ""America’s Tire / Firestone""

""Staples / UPS"", ""America’s Tire / Firestone"" Acceptable: ""Staples"", ""America’s Tire"" However, if the business is an authorized and fully dedicated seller of the branded product or service, sometimes known as a ""franchisee"", you may use the underlying brand name when you create the Business Profile. Acceptable: ""TCC Verizon Wireless Premium Retailer"", ""U-Haul Neighborhood Dealer"" Virtual food brands Virtual food brands are permitted with conditions. Co-located food brands offering pick-up Food brands that are co-located each must have permanent separate signage. They should display their address only if they offer pick-up to all customers. Delivery-only brands (no-pick up option) out of shared kitchens must hide their address and add service areas to that specific brand to avoid confusing their customers.

if they offer pick-up to all customers. Delivery-only food brands Delivery-only brands (i.e. those operating out of virtual kitchens) are permitted if they have distinct branded packaging and a distinct website.

Multiple virtual brands operating out of one location are permitted, but are subject to additional verification steps.

Delivery-only brands must add their service areas and hide the address on their business profile to avoid confusing their customers.

If there is a partnership where a food brand has authorized the virtual kitchen as a verified provider of the food, the virtual kitchen may manage each authorized brand’s business profile once the authorization is confirmed.

The facility that houses the delivery-only brands, i.e. Doordash Kitchens, is permitted to have its own separate business profile. Only someone affiliated with the facility can claim and verify this profile. Rebranding Your Business Profile may be eligible for rebranding (defined as an eligible name change without creating a new Business Profile) if you make a minor name change, in which the proper nouns and services described in the business name remain unchanged and the business category remains unchanged. You may also be eligible for rebranding if you have multiple locations and the business name changes. If your business meets the rebranding criteria above, you can update your business name when you edit your business information. If your business changes its name but doesn't meet the criteria above, then it's considered a new business. You must mark the existing Business Profile as closed and then create a new Business Profile with your new business name. Learn how to mark a profile as closed. If you encounter any issues with rebranding, contact our support team. You can also ask questions and get answers from experts in the Business Profile Community. Tip: If you assume ownership of a Business Profile, you first need to have the previous owner add you as an owner and transfer ownership to you.

Departments within businesses, universities, hospitals, and government institutions may have their own Business Profiles on Google. Auto dealers and healthcare providers have specific and separate guidelines. Get started with Business Profiles for auto dealers and healthcare providers. Publicly-facing departments that operate as distinct entities should have their own page. The exact name of each department must be different from that of the main business and that of other departments. Typically such departments have a separate customer entrance and should each have distinct categories. Their hours may sometimes differ from those of the main business. Acceptable (as distinct Business Profiles): ""Walmart Vision Center"" ""Sears Auto Center"" ""Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Dermatology""

Not acceptable (as distinct Business Profiles): The Apple products section of Best Buy The hot food bar inside Whole Foods Market

For each department, the category that's the most representative of that department must be different from that of the main business and that of other departments. The main business ""Wells Fargo"" has the category ""Bank"" whereas the department ""Wells Fargo Advisors"" has the category ""Financial Consultant.""

The main business ""South Bay Toyota"" has the category ""Toyota Dealer"" whereas the ""South Bay Toyota Service & Parts"" has the category ""Auto Repair Shop"" (plus the category ""Auto Parts Store"").

The main business ""GetGo"" has the category ""Convenience Store"" (plus the category ""Sandwich Shop"") whereas the department ""GetGo Fuel"" has the category ""Gas Station"", and the department ""WetGo"" has the category ""Car Wash.""

An individual practitioner is a public-facing professional, typically with their own customer base. Doctors, dentists, lawyers, financial planners, and insurance or real estate agents are all individual practitioners. Business Profiles for practitioners may include title or degree certification (for example Dr., MD, JD, Esq., CFA). An individual practitioner should create their own dedicated Business Profile if: They operate in a public-facing role. Support staff should not create their own Business Profiles.

They can be contacted directly at the verified location during stated hours. A practitioner shouldn't have multiple Business Profiles to cover all of their specializations. Sales associates or lead generation agents for corporations aren't individual practitioners and aren't eligible for a Business Profile. Multiple practitioners at one location If the practitioner is one of several public-facing practitioners at this location: The organization should create a Business Profile for this location, separate from that of the practitioner.

The title of the Business Profile for the practitioner should include only the name of the practitioner, and shouldn’t include the name of the organization. Solo practitioners that belong to branded organizations If a practitioner is the only public-facing practitioner at a location and represents a branded organization, it's best for the practitioner to share a Business Profile with the organization. Create a single Business Profile, named using the following format: [brand/company]: [practitioner name]. Acceptable: ""Allstate: Joe Miller"" (if Joe is the sole public-facing practitioner at this Allstate-branded location)

Marketing, promotions, or other contests

Any promotion, marketing, contests, or other giveaways should clearly link to the terms of the activity and provide clear guidelines and qualifications. All such promises, given or implied, should be adhered to.

Important: Google reserves the right to suspend access to Business Profiles on Google or other Google Services to individuals or businesses that violate these guidelines, and may work with law enforcement in the event that the violation is unlawful.

325,HATCH INTERIOR DESIGN OFFICE EXPANSION,https://www.hatchdesign.ca/hatch-interior-design-office-expansion/,,"We have some exciting news! The Hatch team has been working for a couple of months on our own office expansion and things are moving right along.

The Brand and The Space

The concept for our expansion is a continuation of the design for our existing office which opened at the beginning of this year. Our goal, as with all of our clients, is to creatively and uniquely convey our brand through the interior design of our space. Here at Hatch we like to do things differently. We excel at contemporary design with a twist, and what better opportunity to show that than in our own office. We are making a big leap from 357 sqft to a whopping 653 sqft which will allow us a boardroom (!), more library space and an additional workstation or two. In a couple of weeks the construction will be complete and we cannot wait!



Our existing office exhibits a variety of coordinating patterns and textures in Hatch

The Details

If you are familiar with our existing office you know that it is all about pattern and texture applied to furniture and walls, and efficient and functional storage. The new space is no different, we are stoked to enhance what we previously completed.

The boardroom is the main attraction and will exhibit a number of patterns and textures that relate to who we are as an interior design firm. There has been a big movement towards demountable wall systems in the corporate office design world, and extending into just about every other sector as well. These systems are not a new concept, but there are a few companies who have really stepped up to modernize and customize their products to be designer friendly. Starwall is great example of this; we are really excited to be using this for our boardroom walls. And you know us, it isn’t your typical installation. We put their product to the test and are anxious to see the patterned and multi-finished partitions complete. Even the framing that stands right now looks pretty darn cool; but we are going to save it to show you later.



The palette for our new boardroom builds on our existing office concept with the addition of a few new patterns and materials; Fig and Tides fabrics from Loomsource VC Decor Concrete Living Starwall Shaw Contract Group

There are so many amazing options for carpet out there right now, it was a hard decision! In the end the best fit was the On The Edge collection from Shaw Contract Group. A mixture of the Verge and Vertical Edge tiles, both in ochre, were a perfect fit. The colours and linear pattern will add just the right amount of interest to the floor while providing a little extra acoustic dampening.

We love our Allseating Zip chairs and have gone with the same for the boardroom (although we almost swapped our task chairs for You chairs, very cool and ergonomic as well), the only differences being the arm style and chair back fabric. We have selected two fabrics from Loomsource, both in organic patterns of Hatch yellow and white, staggering half of our chairs in one and half in the other. The seat will remain Momentum’s PVC free Silica fabric in Cumulus white to match our task chairs.



Our existing Zip chairs by Allseating Momentum Moen’s Schoolhouse Electric

Our favourite, local, custom concrete company, VC Decor Concrete Living, has already been in to template our custom countertop that will be ready for install in a couple of weeks. The undermounted round stainless steel sink will be accompanied by Moen’s sleek Align one handle faucet.

Keep your eyes pealed for pictures of our expansion once it’s complete! For now we come to you from a dishevelled, dusty and sometimes chaotic office. It will just make our new space even sweeter. A big THANK YOU to all who helped make this happen!



Working away in our mess! We will back to normal soon.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. (May 16, 2024) – HNTB Corporation will relocate its offices in Kansas City, currently at 715 Kirk Drive, to another larger downtown location at 1111 Main Street to accommodate its growing workforce. This strategic decision highlights HNTB’s continued dedication to the revitalized downtown area and aligns with the company’s ongoing expansion efforts to meet increasing demand for infrastructure solutions.

“As HNTB continues to grow and add new professionals in Kansas City, it has become increasingly clear that we need a workspace that aligns with our growth trajectory,” said Tom O’Grady, PE, HNTB president. “The new office space has been thoughtfully chosen to not only accommodate our current needs but also to provide room for future expansion. The new space is intended to foster creativity, collaboration and teamwork, all of which are integral to our continuing success.”

The HNTB logo will appear atop the building at 1111 Main Street in Kansas City where the firm will occupy seven contiguous floors by the end of 2025. The building — formerly known as Town Pavilion — was originally designed by HNTB in 1986.

The building has been fully renovated in recent years and offers HNTB’s downtown Kansas City employees amenities including a fitness center, casual dining, retail and conference center. It is conveniently located on the RideKC streetcar line and is walkable to additional restaurants and shopping.

“Relocation to the Eleven Eleven Main building signifies an exciting new chapter for HNTB in Kansas City, a place we’ve called home since our founding in 1914,” said O’Grady. “We are pleased to continue serving clients in a new, updated space for our growing employee base.”

HNTB also recently relocated its expanding Overland Park, Kansas, office which remains open and is unaffected by the relocation in downtown Kansas City.

As part of its ongoing commitment to growth and excellence, HNTB will leverage both office moves to expand its workforce and capabilities. The firm is actively recruiting top talent in the area to join its team of experts and contribute to the success of current and future projects. Interested candidates are encouraged to visit the HNTB careers page for more information on job openings and the benefits of working for HNTB.

Jon Copaken, principal at Copaken Brooks, the landlord representative of the 1111 Main building, expressed enthusiasm about HNTB’s move, noting, “This is a great opportunity for HNTB, the 1111 Main Building and downtown Kansas City. In a globally challenging office market, to have HNTB choose 1111 Main is a testament to the building’s longevity as the Class A destination of choice in Kansas City. The move also reinforces downtown Kansas City as the preferred business center for the next generation of growth-oriented companies in the Kansas City area.”",announced office relocation
294,HR Concerns with moving office,https://durrantremovals.com/hr-concerns-with-moving-office/,,"When the big day arrives, you’ll need a strong plan in place to make sure everything gets to your new office without a hitch.

Ahead of moving day, ask your removal company to carry out a risk assessment at both your new office and your old one. This will highlight any equipment issues or access problems that might get in the way, and help you find a way around them.

The removal team will also take care of moving any potentially dangerous or delicate electrical equipment. Before they arrive, disconnect all computers, phones, printers and kitchen equipment ready for moving to the new office.

The day before the move, ask your staff to clear their desks and sort through any drawers or lockers to make sure nothing gets lost or damaged in transition.

Ideally, you should move on a day when your employees are out of the office, so that your removal company can do their job without any obstructions and your teams won’t need to work with distractions.

The same applies to the final office cleaning. According to the experts at the Fantastic Cleaners office cleaning company, commercial premises have to be fully empty of any company inventory or employee belongings before the commercial office cleaning service can happen.",plans to move office

314,Health and safety when moving office,https://www.internationalworkplace.com/about-us/news-and-insight/health-and-safety-when-moving-office,,"Health and safety when moving office

Office relocation can be a hectic time and it often also comes with an increased risk of workplace accident and injury because of the activities outside the norm of usual day-to-day office operations. As a result, it’s important to be organised and ensure that you have carefully considered any potential health and safety issues that could occur during the moving process.

Staff involvement in the move

Ideally, the move should be carried out by removal professionals on a day where staff aren’t present, over the weekend for example – this would mostly eliminate having to assess the risk for staff members in the moving process.

It can be tempting to get the assistance of your employees to help with the move, especially if you come from a SME without a huge amount of equipment / furniture to move. However, all it takes is for one small incident to occur and that could amount a serious injury that your company could be liable for.

For instance, roughly 10% of major injuries are related to manual handling and a large percentage of the population (1.1 million) suffer from musculoskeletal disorders, which are easily aggravated by manual handling. So while it may not seem like a big deal to have employees help move a few desks or a couple of boxes, it could be more detrimental than you think.

Moving Risk Assessment and guidelines

If you do decide that you will include your staff in the moving process, in whatever capacity, then it’s important to perform a risk assessment and try to control for or eliminate these risks as much as is reasonably possible. You should also provide a clear guide to your employees of safety protocols. Even though some of them may seem relatively basic, it never hurts to have a reminder and increased awareness will lessen the likelihood of liability if an accident were to occur during the move.

When trying to identify risks or hazards of the moving process, you might want to start by considering the following:

What do the various tasks involved in moving office require? Take into account the actions such as heavy lifting and manoeuvring the furniture / boxes through small spaces or up stairways. Could such tasks be made safer if you hired equipment?

Also think about the individuals undertaking these tasks, do they have any health problems which may be relevant? Do any of the tasks needed for the move require any specialist knowledge or training?

Consider, especially when it comes to moving large or heavy items, who will move these, and if any items may be difficult to move. For instance, if a piece of furniture is awkwardly shaped and may need to be deconstructed in order to fit through a doorway. With trickier, large or heavyweight items, it might be worth hiring professionals to move them and then getting staff to help with the easier, less accident-potential tasks and items.

It’s also worth assessing the environment, both the office you’re moving from and to. Take the time to look round your new location and consider it in terms of the move - you are likely to be a lot less familiar with that environment than your current office space. Think about transporting the items into the new location – will it be easy to get them into the building and up to the appropriate floor? Are there any fire exits or walkways that you might risk obstructing in the move? Trips and falls are as much of a risk as injury due to manual labour. Do any of the surfaces or flooring look slippery or unstable?

It’s important to try and anticipate any hazards and create procedures that will help reduce the risk of incidents occurring. For instance, the University of Surrey have created a detailed set of guidelines for when individuals move offices, which you can see here. The instructions are relatively simple, such as:

“Ensure that everyone involved in the move understands the procedure in the unlikely event of an accident or incident.”

But it is this kind of practically, planning and instruction that helps to reduce both accidents and liability, especially when the move involves individuals whose job does not generally include manual labour.

Choosing a qualified removal company

If you do choose to have professionals help you move, it’s important to look around at different removal companies and ensure you pick the right one. This is definitely the safest option, but you still want to make sure the professionals you hire are insured and licensed for this kind of work; it also might be worth checking that if anything gets damaged in the move, will it will be covered.

There are various certifications you can look for that will help you discern the quality of a removal company. For instance, an ISO 9001 certification is an internationally recognised standard for quality management and demonstrates a professional approach as verified by an outside source.

Ensuring the new office meets health and safety regulations

When selecting your new office, there were probably a range of considerations. But something you may not have factored in before signing the lease was whether it met health and safety regulations. Although any major risks are likely to be relatively obvious, there may be some smaller health and safety concerns that may not have initially sprung to mind.

Legally as an employer, you are obligated to ensure that the workspace you provide your employees meets a long list of requirements, which you can view in full here. I will list a few that you may have forgotten to consider. As an employer, you must provide:

- Window cleaning safety in the office: make sure all windows and skylights are designed and constructed so that they may be cleaned safely.

- Outside lighting: well-lit outside areas – for pedestrians and to help with work activities such as loading / unloading at night.

- Temperature control in the office: local heating or cooling where a comfortable temperature cannot be maintained throughout each workroom (e.g. hot and cold processes).

- Ventilation in the office: good ventilation – a sufficient supply of fresh, clean air drawn from outside or a ventilation system.

Overall, there are a lot of factors to be taken into account to ensure safe office relocation. However, taking the time to assess risks and address practical concerns involved in an office move can save a lot of hassle in the long run.",announced office relocation

This Innovation, Research and Development (IRD) Strategic Plan is DHS’ first ever. To learn about what it calls for and how it came together, Federal News Network’s Eric White talked with Jon McEntee, who is operations and requirements director with DHS S&T.

Interview Transcript:

Eric White Tasked by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate has formulated a plan for the agency’s investment goals in specific research areas. This innovation research and development strategic plan is DHS’s first ever. To learn more about what it calls for and how it came together, we welcome Jon McEntee, who is operations and requirements director with DHS S&T. Mr. McEntee, thank you so much for taking the time.

Jon McEntee Oh, thank you for having me.

Eric White Of course, of course. So why don’t we just start with getting an overview of what exactly is this document? As I mentioned, it’s the first ever from DHS. Is it just calling for where you want to put specific research dollars, or what’s the deal here?

Jon McEntee So we refer to it as IRD. So it’s innovation, research and development. So, the IRD strategic plan is the department’s blueprint of priorities and associated resourcing decisions. It’s put together to prepare DHS and the homeland security enterprise to address future threats and hazards. And the homeland security enterprise includes federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, as well as private entity partnerships, those that want to protect the homeland. So it was put together to not only internally coordinate and collaborate investments across the department, but also as a demand signal to our external partners within industry, international, interagency, and academia, to showcase the IRD needs through FY 30. It really looks to collaborate, again, not only internally, but externally. And we also performed internal analysis to help with that demand signal. It’s going to show the major muscle movements where the department wants to be, and these cross cutting IRD things make up what we call the strategic priority research areas. And those are optimal mission impacts the department’s going to be facing over the future years to come. We identified eight of them, and we call them, we refer to them as SPRAs. They include advanced sensing, artificial intelligence and autonomous systems, biotechnology, climate change, communications and networking, cybersecurity, data integration, analytics, modeling and simulation. And finally, digital identity and trust.

Eric White Yeah, we’ll get into a couple of those in a little bit. I just wanted to take a step back. And, you know, you mentioned how you looked at the internal priorities of where the department wants to be, how did that decision process go? Because it’s so hard to see what the next threat is going to be, especially when your area of coverage is as large as the DHS’s is. You know, how did you come up with those strategic priority research areas, or SPRAs as you mentioned?

Jon McEntee It was absolutely a collaboration across the department. We spent about eight months working with all the DHS components. And you know, we had to first inventory all of the IRD activities. We conducted a SWOT analysis, which is strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats. We held a futures workshop. We collected component future trends assessments that included risks, threats, challenges. And we also reviewed all the existing national DHS and component IRD strategies and guidance. So what we ended up putting together as a culmination of of information that identifies where improvements are needed to stay ahead of the threats. It speaks to the “what,” not necessarily the “how,” meaning technology evolves rapidly. And we want to perform a technology solution analysis as close to the implementation here as possible. And we have to continue to monitor the evolution of technology throughout the lifecycle with any effort that we do. For example, if we do a technology solution too soon, in looking at FY 30, we run the risk of obsolescence. So it’s a delicate balance between out year planning, as well as current year execution.

Eric White I want to zero in on just one other part of your first answer, which you’d mentioned your partners in industry. So this is kind of you putting up the flag as well, saying, hey, this is what we’re going to be interested in in the future if you want to work with us. Right?

Jon McEntee Exactly. And it’s that demand signal. When I say the homeland security enterprise, and it’s every entity that wants to protect the homeland. And we know that there’s a lot of innovation and investment that has gone into that, and we want to be able to tackle it and to partner with those external entities. We actually held a technology innovation network event back in October, to present some of our initial findings of our analysis and to gain additional feedback. At the event, we also had our Office of Procurement operations there. And S&T’s office of industry partnerships, to help answer the question how to do business with DHS, because you know that linkage is very important. And once we gain that level of networking that enables us to work with them in the future as well. And so we did a showcase also at the Consumer Electronics Show. We’re doing another event in Monterey, California at the Naval Postgraduate School later this month. It’s with the Military Operations Research Society. And we have a number of other, you know, engagements planned the balance of the year. But again, the important piece is, hey, let’s leverage a lot of that great innovation the industry is already working and tailor it to Homeland Security enterprise needs.

Eric White We’re speaking with Jon McEntee. He is operations and requirements director with DHS S&T. So this is the first one you all have ever done. How will this document change the way that S&T does invest its dollars, and what was the difference before this document was formulated? Were you just kind of playing whack-a-mole and saying, well, we definitely are going to need to do this, let’s put money there? Or was it, you know, a little bit more structured than that? I’m sure it was.

Jon McEntee Right. Traditionally, a lot of what we did in the past was individual component IRD analysis. And what this does, it looks across the department. And it takes a different tack. It’s a collaborative approach. And identifying and leveraging leveraging each other’s investments internally, but then it helps us to plan across the department together, and to focus our limited resources on the department’s highest priorities. And again, this allows us to complement one another, and also to avoid duplication and effort. And this is why we develop those themes, the SPRAs, so that we can identify those major muscle movements that impact multiple components, not just singular components.

Eric White Yeah, let’s get into those SPRAs. It just speaks to, once again, the vast amount of coverage that DHS is responsible for. The ones that stick out the most to me probably are cybersecurity and AI, just because those are definitely the talk of the town. But you know, bringing back in biotechnology, which, that used to be one of the number one threats everybody was afraid of, but it’s coming back into the realm it seems, and as well as advanced sensing. I mean, it is all here, you know, how are you going to dictate which ones require more attention, I guess?

Jon McEntee And that’s one thing we’ve developed internally within the department. We actually stood up what’s called the IRD Coordination Council. It’s co-chaired by the undersecretary for science and technology, as well as the undersecretary of management. And the council’s goal is to ensure that the most pressing challenges the department faces, have appropriate and effective investments to support those mission areas. And you know, and through that, that helps us with prioritization as well. And the IRD helps us to filter into those common themes, SPRAs, and also identify those areas that we need to tackle first. And so during the first year of investment, what we plan to do is look at all the SPRAs across the board, and develop roadmaps and determine where the department currently is, and also where we want to be through FY 30. And so that’s kind of the goal the first year, because this enables us to better complement each other’s investments. And so in looking at this helps us to identify those areas that have no investments. And we call those IRD deltas. And again, now that the plan is released, we also want to enhance our external partnership and leverage those existing and future IRD investments. Because in those areas where we have IRD deltas, industry or some of our external partners, interagency, academia, or even international may have solution sets or capability enhancements that we can look at, and to look at these common denominators that we’ve identified. And so this is that demand signal. We see this as a target market opportunity for those external investors to make their own business decisions.

220,How Much Office Space Do You Really Need?,https://thereceptionist.com/blog/how-much-office-space-do-you-really-need/,,"When you begin the process of finding a new office, your first consideration should be size. Layout, furniture, seating arrangements…none of these factors matter until you know how large of a space you require.

After all, the size of your office is the one thing you can’t change without incurring a significant expense.

How much office space do you really need? That’s actually a complex question. We can’t give you an exact figure or a clear formula, but we can explain what you should consider to answer that question for yourself.

Consider the following variables carefully. If you lease too little space, you’ll struggle to fit your growing business and possibly handicap your growth. If you lease too much space, you’ll find yourself burdened by unnecessary costs.

Workspace

As you start to hunt for a new office, every listing will throw the same number at you right away: Square footage. This metric will also be the first feature real estate agents will mention when they walk you through a new space.

According to Office Finder, it’s best to allow about 175 square feet of space for each person who works in your office. Leaders and executives usually require between 200 and 400 foot square feet. Open office workstations only require about 100 square feet per person.

Admittedly, that’s tough to visualize. This infographic will help.

These are general guidelines that vary based on your type of business. Call center workers, for instance, don’t need much desk space, but architects need a lot of room to lay out blueprints. Your square footage needs will increase if you require dedicated meeting space, offices with closed doors, or a specific layout of desks/cubicles.

Consider specialty working space beyond desks and cubicles. Do you need a server room? Refrigerated space for food and beverages? Manufacturing equipment? Medical exam rooms?

Those guidelines refer to usable space, by the way, not total space. Some building owners and listing agents will include square footage that can’t be used reasonably (alcoves, cubbies, etc.) in their total. If you’re thinking about leasing a space, it’s smart to measure it yourself to make sure you get what you pay for.

Calculating how much square footage you need isn’t a precise science. Nevertheless, it’s good to have a range in mind so your real estate agent knows which spaces to show you.

For instance, you might determine that you need at least 12,000 square feet, but don’t want to pay for more than 18,000.

If you’re unsure about how much space you need, try this calculator to get a general idea.

Layout

To determine how much space you need, it’s best to start with the type of layout that best suits your business. Essentially, you have three options.

On one end of the spectrum are open offices: Big open rooms where everyone sits and works together. Workers usually sit at community tables or desk clusters.

On the other end of the spectrum are networks of traditional private offices, conference rooms, and support rooms. These aren’t as trendy as open offices, but many business prefer them.

The third option is some combination of both. Employees have some degree of privacy, but plenty of work happens right in the open. This layout is useful for teams with mixed needs. For instance, the marketing team may like working together in a group, but the CEO needs a door he or she can close.

With open offices, you can pack more people into the same space, but private offices provide privacy and confidentiality. Study the advantages and disadvantages of each before choosing a layout for your team.

Common Space

Every office requires some common space. Here are some general guidelines:

Work group areas: 80 to 100 sq. ft. per person

Quiet rooms: 25 to 50 sq. ft.

Conference rooms: 15 to 30 sq. ft. per person

Reception area: 75 sq. ft. per person

File room: 200 sq. ft.

Storage room or library: 200 sq. ft.

Lunch rooms: 15 sq. ft. per person (not including kitchen area).

Restroom: 55 sq. ft. for a one-seater and 30 sq. ft. for each additional seat

Nevertheless, your common space needs depend on your style of business. For instance, open office layouts probably don’t need dedicated meeting space, except in cases where meetings discuss private matters. Private offices need somewhere to meet together, except in the case of small teams who don’t mind meeting in someone’s office.

If you expect to receive guests, customers, patients, vendors, or partners, you’ll need a reception area. This space needs to accommodate your receptionist (or team) plus as many guests as you expect to enter at a given time.

You can reduce your reception needs by implementing a tool like The Receptionist for iPad. It replaces most of your reception tasks like checking in arrivals, collecting visitor information, notifying your team, and printing badges.

Culture

You wouldn’t think abstract attributes like your company culture would play a role in your physical office space, but it’s actually quite impactful.

Examine your culture carefully and ask how it affects how your team works. If you aren’t in tune with your culture, you may have to review your mission statement or company values.

For instance, if your company values long stretches of uninterrupted work (perhaps you ban meetings before lunch), you’ll need workspaces that facilitate privacy and focus, which may cost more square footage per employee.

If your company values leanness and agility, you may be willing to sacrifice some square footage to spend that cash on growth.

Additionally, consider how the workplace is changing. It is estimated that by 2025, there will be 36 million remote workers in the United States. You may not need as much space as you think if a portion of your workforce works from home occasionally. Sharing desks (“hoteling”) could be an option.

Truthfully, these types of variables are ambiguous and tough to plan, especially if you don’t have experience in office design. It’s worth the money to work with an architect or design consultant to get it right.

The Future

Moving to a new office isn’t something you want to do often, so it’s important to plan ahead and make sure your next office meets your current and future needs.

Do you expect to hire more people next year? Will you move into a new market or verticle that requires space for special tools? Do you need somewhere to put next year’s big inventory buy? It’s best to lease spaces so that you reach your occupancy limit two-thirds or three-quarters of the way through your lease term.

Think about how your business will change over the next ten years. Consider everything you can, like how your business will grow (and what you’ll need to handle that growth), how the economy will change (for your market and in general), and what kinds of equipment and people your office space will need to support.

Consult your business plan or whatever roadmap you use to plot your business’ course. Sit down with anyone in a leadership role and ask them about their future needs. Find out how they plan to use their allotted space over the coming years.

The Bottom Line

How much office space do you really need? Enough to comfortably seat all of your employees, provide for shared common space, suit your culture, and allow for future growth. If you have the funds or expect to grow quickly, tack another 10-15% on their for safe measure.

If you carefully consider the critical variables we’ve outlined here, you’ll find the perfect space that pleases your team and meets your needs.",considering new office space
458,How Thailand is strategically positioned for international ...,https://kadence.com/how-thailand-is-strategically-positioned-for-international-expansion/,,"Located in the heart of mainland Southeast Asia, Thailand —officially called The Kingdom of Thailand —and formerly known as Siam, shares its borders with Liam and Combodia in the east, the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia in the south, the Andaman Sea and Myanmar in the west; and Laos and Myanmar in the north.

The country is positioned for international market entry geographically and economically. Thailand ranks 21st out of 190 countries in the Word Bank’s 2020 Ease of Doing Business report and ranked number three according to the U.S. News & World Report on the best countries to start a business in 2022. This U.S. news and world report rankings are derived from a global survey of more than 17,000 people.

A Business-friendly economy

Thailand has a population of 69 million people with business-friendly policies and a growing economy.

Thailand is well-known globally for stable economic growth, friendly international business relations, excellent incentives for foreign corporations, and a cost-effective local workforce. Owing to its proximity to some of the fastest-growing economies, like China and India, the country offers several lucrative trade opportunities with these two countries and many Asian nations.

The standard corporate tax rate in Thailand is 20 percent —however, for companies and partnerships where paid-in capital is less than THB 5 million and income of less than THB 30 million, the first THB 300,000 in net profit is tax-free. The THB 300,000 to 3 million net profit is subject to 15 percent corporate tax. Any net profit over THB 3 million is subject to 20 percent corporate tax.

While foreigners generally can own no more than 49 percent of the shares in a Thai company, there are specific sectors where the government allows foreign companies to hold a more significant portion of the business.

Setting up a company in Thailand

Depending on your business activities, setting up a business in Thailand may require acquiring a license or permit. Certain business activities are more regulated by the Thai government, such as tourism, school, childcare, liquor, medical, and food and beverage industries. Setting up a company in these industries can be lengthy and complex. It is always a good idea to find a legal firm in Thailand to help with setting up a company in Thailand.

Thailand is particularly suitable for manufacturing sectors. Foreign automobile brands, such as the Japan-based Toyota, Honda and Nissan and U.S.-based Ford Motors, have set up manufacturing plants in the country. These automobile brands have established their production base for exports to neighbouring countries and the rest of the world. Nissan manufactures under the Siam Motors Nissan Company, and Isuzu has two plants making pick-up trucks in Thailand. These companies have set up their export operations in Thailand. Many other brands, like the U.K.-based Marks and Spencer and Bodyshop, have also expanded into Thailand due to the lucrative market and lower start-up costs it offers, along with sound trade policies and the country’s strategic location providing access to other Asian countries.

Many new entrants enjoy access to the Greater Mekong sub-region, where emerging markets offer the tremendous prospect of setting up a company in Thailand.

Most recently, according to the Global COVID-19 Index (GCI) report, Thailand was ranked number one in the world among countries with the highest COVID-19 recovery rate.

What do Thai consumers want from brands?

Consumers in Thailand are price-conscious and show a preference for local brands and low-priced imported goods from the west. There is a market for brands bringing in higher-priced items, but they need a different market strategy and should work with a local partner.

About half of Thailand’s Most-Favored-Nation (MFN) tariff schedule comprises less than five percent of duties, and nearly 30 percent of tariff lines are free. In 2020, Thailand’s average MFN applied tariff rate was 10.2 percent. However, the tariff was significantly higher for agricultural products at 29.3 percent.

Like most other foreign markets, doing business in Thailand has its share of challenges, although when you look at the big picture, these are minuscule. One crucial challenge is the language barrier. While most middle and top management can communicate fluently in English, lower-tier workers are more likely comfortable speaking Thai.

Many Thai retailers digitised their stores to enable online shopping using data analytics to understand better the latest trends and the shift in consumer behaviour.

The digitisation began before the pandemic but accelerated during the lockdown as it imposed restrictions in 2020. This, along with increased internet and mobile phone use, improved logistics and online payment systems, resulted in spikes in B2C and B2B eCommerce.

According to reports, revenue in Thailand’s eCommerce market is expected to show a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR 2022-2027) of 14.99 percent, resulting in a projected market volume of USD 38.72 billion by 2027.

Rising smartphone penetration (about 40 percent) has led to the growth of M-commerce —online shopping using a smartphone. The mobile commerce market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12 percent to reach USD 25 billion by 2023.

The Thai government’s Thailand 4.0 policy aims at allocating a specific budget for constructing a broadband network in rural areas to help bridge the digital divide, giving an impetus to the already flourishing eCommerce market.

According to JP Morgan, using debit or credit cards is still a popular method of e-commerce payments in Thailand, and most Thai people prefer debit over credit. While cash on delivery is widely available on Thai e-commerce platforms, it is on its way to declining.

International or cross-border e-commerce comprises almost 30 percent of the overall e-commerce market in the country. The top five e-commerce platforms are Shopee, Lazada, Kaidee, AliExpress, and Amazon.

675,How To Develop a Strategy Roadmap in Six Steps,https://www.jibility.com/blog/six-steps-develop-strategy-roadmap,,"â

Most organizations struggle to translate their goals or strategic vision into an implementation plan. Often, it is derived by getting a group of stakeholders together in a workshop to âgenerateâ a list of initiatives or activities with sticky notes on a wall.

Imagine that youâve just held one such workshop and generated a long list of initiatives. How do you know that delivering all these initiatives will achieve the strategic goal? How do you know which ones to target first? Do you even know the basis for these initiatives that the team has created?

Whatâs missing is a strategy roadmap: a bridge (or link) between strategy and implementation plans. It describes the key outcomes and the order in which these should be delivered.

â

Simplifying Architecture for the Business

For years, our business architects had delivered strategy roadmaps for a variety of organizations, from large multi-nationals to local SMEs. We applied a number of different methods across these engagements, including industry methods for capability-based planning such as the Open Group TOGAFÂ®.

Learning from our experiences, we began to question the complexity of some of the techniques and methods we applied. Often this was driven by our clients, who either didnât see value in what we were doing or didnât understand the approach we were applying. This led us to refine and simplify our strategy roadmapping method.

Today, we call that simplified method the Jibility StepsÂ®. This approach comprises six simple steps that build on each other to create a strategy roadmap.

â

Six Strategy Roadmap Steps

â

1. Lay out your challenges

âAsk yourself: Why does the strategic vision or goals exist?|

To answer this, you need to fully define the challenges to be solved by your strategic vision or goals. Articulate the problems and opportunities and turn this into your list of challenges.

â

2. Set your objectivesâ

Ask yourself: What must you achieve to address these challenges?

âEach challenge youâve defined must be addressed by a particular objective. When you create a list of objectives, each one must clearly link back to the corresponding challenge.

â

3. Assess your capabilitiesâ

Ask yourself: What capabilities do you need to invest in to meet the objectives?

âImagine that capabilities are the building blocks of your organization and that each of these building blocks describes the people, processes and physical aspects.

For each objective, you should now list the building blocks that will deliver to it. For example, capability building blocks for an objective such as âincrease sales volume by 15%â could be digital marketing and sales management. Each capability building block listed must be clearly marked with a link to the corresponding objective.

Next, assess each of these required capabilities against their current state and determine how much of a change (if any) is required to the capability in order to meet the linked objectives.

If a change is required, mark each capability to indicate that a change is required. One way to do this is to mark the capabilities as follows:

â Nothing â No change required â

â No change required Low (L) â Low level of change required â

â Low level of change required Medium (M) â Medium level of change required â

â Medium level of change required High (H) â High level of change required â

â High level of change required New (N) â A new capability.

For example, â(1) Digital marketing (N)â and â(1) Sales management (M)â (where (1) is the link to the objective number).

Note that itâs likely youâll end up with listing way too many capabilities, with too many of these requiring a level of change. At this point, start prioritizing: which are the most important capabilities for delivering the objectives? Mark the capabilities as high, medium or low priority. Only focus on the capabilities that have a priority.

â

4. Determine your actionsâ

Ask yourself: What do I have to do to bridge the most important capability gaps?â

Once youâve assessed your capabilities, itâs time to define the actions required to change each one in order to bridge the capability gap. These actions should consider the people changes, process changes and physical changes.

For example, for a sales management capability, a people action could be to appoint a dedicated digital sales person; a process action could be to enhance the sales process to cater for digital sales opportunity management; and a physical action could be to implement a digital sales management tool.

â

5. Formulate your initiativesâ

Ask yourself: How can the actions be logically grouped for execution?

When you have defined the actions, itâs time to group related ones into packages of work. We call these âinitiativesâ, but these packages of work could also be projects or programs â it depends on the level of granularity of each action.

Again, no doubt youâll have more initiatives than the organization can afford to commit to, so another round of prioritization is required. There are many ways to do this, for example prioritization matrices. However, a simple method is to apply a priority order number to each initiative from 1 to n where 1 is the highest priority and n is the total number of initiatives. Then just decide where in the list to draw a line. The top part is what will be implemented.

â

6. Generate your roadmapâ

Ask yourself: What order should the initiatives be delivered in?

The final step is to create a roadmap that describes which initiatives are delivered, and in what sequence. To do this, you can map the initiatives onto a grid like this:

Lastly, pull it all together to tell the strategy roadmap story. You can do this by compiling the content from each of the strategy roadmap steps into a presentation or a document. Itâs up to you, but keep these key points in mind:



Keep it simple

The easier your method is for both the practitioner and those whose input is required, the better.

Start with âwhyâ

A sound strategy roadmap method justifies or validates what changes need to be implemented.

Issue: Sep 2021

Office relocation is just as busy as moving into a new home. The change can be both exciting as well as stressful. There is a lot of thought and planning involved for a smooth relocation to avoid business disruption. Here are several important-to-remember office relocation tips to help ensure a quick, smooth and efficient move.

Plan the Move in Advance

Workspace relocation is not something that can be done overnight. It will require detailed as well as precise planning. A tip on how to move office is to start the process in advance with the first step, that is, prepare a schedule. This schedule needs to be specific with “who” prepares “what” to move as well as “when” things need to be moved and stored away. Each week, employees can be put into teams to take turns on sorting what is needed and what the new office can do without. Within the planned moving schedule, you should have sufficient time to consider logistics such as equipment, utilities, paperwork, and backing up company data. Planning ahead will also save you time, effort and money. This is because you would be able to plan the transportation service in advance for a quality service and a reasonable one too.

Inform Employees & Stakeholders

This is possibly one of the most important office relocation tips that should be in the top 3 of your to-do-list. Ensure that your employees and stakeholders are updated with the plans and schedule of the relocation. Create email announcements on the details of the move such as the time, date and location of the new office. You can even come up with a Relocation Committee with an assigned Project Manager. Get the team to prepare a checklist to ensure nothing gets left behind or overlooked and everyone should be responsible for clearing out their own workspaces.

Eliminate Unwanted Items

Understand that some items cannot come along such as outdated documents, junk files and other unnecessary items. Do not forget to consult with the relevant personnel on which items can be disposed of. You would want your new office to be clean and neat and therefore, some items that are less used can be stored away in a self storage facility. One of such facilities is offered by StorHub at their Chai Wan storage facility and they provide a reliable business storage space solution to solve the problem of insufficient storage space in the office. Their flexible lease terms and convenient payment methods allow you to enjoy high-quality self storage services at affordable prices. You can even use their space calculator to decide on just how much business storage space you need.

Look for Efficient Movers

Another tip on how to move to your new office is by making sure you have a reliable mode of transportation for your items. Check on the reviews of professional movers to help you assess their service level in order to gain a good moving experience. Many relocation companies know what to do to give you a smooth moving experience. Ensure they provide packing and unpacking services so that your items are safely transported. Come up with a moving plan with the moving company to avoid any mishaps on the actual day. Choose a company that is certified as well as one that provides insurance for your items while in transition.

Arrange for Moving Supplies

Among the office moving tips is that you will need packaging materials such as boxes, packing items and moving supplies to keep things organised. StorHub also has carton boxes, tapes, box cutters and bubble wraps for sale at their reception office to help you pack and organise items that are going to be stored away in the self storage facility.

If you follow these office moving tips, rest assured that you will be able to have a smooth transition to your new workplace. You need to understand that there are many temporary storage spaces for business items but not all will offer you the reliability and excellent business storage experience. StorHub provides one of the best self storages you can find in Hong Kong. Equipped with high-quality storage units that are in compliance with the fire safety regulations in Hong Kong, high-tech security system, flexible storage terms, you will experience total peace of mind with StorHub Self Storage.

1,How To Write a Business Plan in 9 Steps (2024),https://www.shopify.com/blog/business-plan,,"A great business plan can help you clarify your strategy, identify potential roadblocks, determine necessary resources, and evaluate the viability of your idea and growth plan before you start a business.

Not every successful business launches with a formal business plan, but many founders find value in taking time to step back, research their idea and the market they’re looking to enter, and understand the scope and the strategy behind their tactics. That’s where writing a business plan comes in.

Learn how to write a business plan with a step-by-step guide, get tips for getting the most of your plan, and see real business plan examples to inspire you.

What is a business plan?

A business plan is a strategic document that outlines a company's goals, strategies for achieving them, and the time frame for their achievement. It covers aspects like market analysis, financial projections, and organizational structure, serving as a roadmap for business growth and a tool to secure funding.

Often, financial institutions and investors need to see a business plan before funding any project. Even if you don’t plan to seek outside funding, a well-crafted plan becomes the guidance for your business as it scales.

How to write a business plan in 9 steps

Few things are more intimidating than a blank page. Starting your business plan with a structured outline and key elements for what you’ll include in each section is the best first step you can take.

Since an outline is such an important step in the process of writing a business plan, we’ve put together a high-level overview to get you started (and avoid the terror of facing a blank page).

Once you have your business plan template in place, it’s time to fill it in. We’ve broken it down by section to help you build your plan step by step.

1. Draft an executive summary.

A good executive summary is one of the most crucial sections of your plan—it’s also the last section you should write.

The executive summary distills everything that follows and gives time-crunched reviewers (e.g., potential investors and lenders) a high-level overview of your business that persuades them to read further.

Again, it’s a summary, so highlight the key points you’ve uncovered while writing your plan. If you’re writing for your own planning purposes, you can skip the summary altogether—although you might want to give it a try anyway, just for practice.

An executive summary shouldn’t exceed one page. Admittedly, that space constraint can make squeezing in all of the salient information a bit stressful—but it’s not impossible. Your business plan’s executive summary should include:

Business concept. What does your business do?

What does your business do? Business goals and vision. What does your business want to do?

What does your business want to do? Product description and differentiation. What do you sell, and why is it different?

What do you sell, and why is it different? Target market. Who do you sell to?

Who do you sell to? Marketing strategy. How do you plan on reaching your customers?

How do you plan on reaching your customers? Current financial state. What do you currently earn in revenue?

What do you currently earn in revenue? Projected financial state. What do you foresee earning in revenue?

What do you foresee earning in revenue? The ask. How much money are you asking for?

How much money are you asking for? The team. Who’s involved in the business?

2. Write a company description.

This section of your business plan should answer two fundamental questions: who are you, and what do you plan to do?

Answering these questions with a company description provides an introduction to why you’re in business, why you’re different, what you have going for you, and why you’re a good investment.

For example, clean makeup brand Saie shares a letter from its founder on the company’s mission and why it exists.

Clarifying these details is still a useful exercise, even if you’re the only person who’s going to see them. It’s an opportunity to put to paper some of the more intangible facets of your business, like your principles, ideals, and cultural philosophies.

Here are some of the components you should include in your company description:

Your business structure (Are you a sole proprietorship, general partnership, limited partnership, or incorporated company?)

Your business model

Your industry

Your business’s vision, mission, and value proposition

Background information on your business or its history

Business objectives, both short and long term

Your team, including key personnel and their salaries

Brand values and goals

To define your brand values, think about all the people your company is accountable to, including owners, employees, suppliers, customers, and investors. Now consider how you’d like to conduct business with each of them. As you make a list, your core values should start to emerge.

Your company description should also include both short- and long-term goals. Short-term goals, generally, should be achievable within the next year, while one to five years is a good window for long-term goals. Make sure your goal setting includes SMART goals: specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound.

Vision and mission statements

Once you know your values, you can write a mission statement. Your statement should explain, in a convincing manner, why your business exists, and should be no longer than a single sentence.

Next, craft your vision statement: What impact do you envision your business having on the world once you’ve achieved your vision? Phrase this impact as an assertion—begin the statement with “We will” and you’ll be off to a great start. Your vision statement, unlike your mission statement, can be longer than a single sentence, but try to keep it to three at most. The best vision statements are concise.

3. Perform a market analysis.

No matter what type of business you start, it’s no exaggeration to say your market can make or break it. Choose the right market for your products—one with plenty of customers who understand and need your product—and you’ll have a head start on success. If you choose the wrong market, or the right market at the wrong time, you may find yourself struggling for each sale.

This is why market research and analysis is a key section of your business plan, whether or not you ever intend for anyone else to read it. It should include an overview of how big you estimate the market is for your products, an analysis of your business’s position in the market, and an overview of the competitive landscape. Thorough research supporting your conclusions is important both to persuade investors and to validate your own assumptions as you work through your plan.

Here is an example to illustrate how to approach this section:

How big is your potential market?

The potential market is an estimate of how many people need your product. While it’s exciting to imagine sky-high sales figures, you’ll want to use as much relevant independent data as possible to validate your estimated potential market.

Since this can be a daunting process, here are some general tips to help you begin your research:

Understand your ideal customer profile. Look for government data about the size of your target market, learn where they live, what social channels they use, and their shopping habits.

Look for government data about the size of your target market, learn where they live, what social channels they use, and their shopping habits. Research relevant industry trends and trajectory. Explore consumer trends and product trends in your industry by looking at Google Trends, trade publications, and influencers in the space.

Explore consumer trends and product trends in your industry by looking at Google Trends, trade publications, and influencers in the space. Make informed guesses. You’ll never have perfect, complete information about your total addressable market. Your goal is to base your estimates on as many verifiable data points as necessary.

Some sources to consult for market data include government statistics offices, industry associations, academic research, and respected news outlets covering your industry.

SWOT analysis

A SWOT analysis looks at your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. What are the best things about your company? What are you not so good at? What market or industry shifts can you take advantage of and turn into opportunities? Are there external factors threatening your ability to succeed?

SWOT is often depicted in a grid or visual way. With this visual presentation, your reader can quickly see the factors that may impact your business and determine your competitive advantage in the market.

Competitive analysis

There are three overarching factors you can use to differentiate your business in the face of competition:

Cost leadership. You have the capacity to maximize profits by offering lower prices than the majority of your competitors. Examples include companies like Mejuri and Endy.

You have the capacity to maximize profits by offering lower prices than the majority of your competitors. Examples include companies like Mejuri and Endy. Differentiation. Your product or service offers something distinct from the current cost leaders in your industry and banks on standing out based on your uniqueness. Think of companies like Knix and QALO.

Your product or service offers something distinct from the current cost leaders in your industry and banks on standing out based on your uniqueness. Think of companies like Knix and QALO. Segmentation. You focus on a very specific, or niche, target market, and aim to build traction with a smaller audience before moving on to a broader market. Companies like TomboyX and Heyday Footwear are great examples of this strategy.

To understand which is the best fit, you’ll need to understand your business as well as the competitive landscape.

You’ll always have competition in the market, even with an innovative product, so it’s important to include a competitive overview in your business plan. If you’re entering an established market, include a list of a few companies you consider direct competitors and explain how you plan to differentiate your products and business from theirs.

For example, if you’re selling jewelry, your competitive differentiation could be that, unlike many high-end competitors, you donate a percentage of your profits to a notable charity or pass savings on to your customers.

If you’re entering a market where you can’t easily identify direct competitors, consider your indirect competitors—companies offering products that are substitutes for yours. For example, if you’re selling an innovative new piece of kitchen equipment, it’s too easy to say that because your product is new, you have no competition. Consider what your potential customers are doing to solve the same problems.

4. Outline the management and organization.

The management and organization section of your business plan should tell readers about who’s running your company. Detail the legal structure of your business. Communicate whether you’ll incorporate your business as an S corporation or create a limited partnership or sole proprietorship.

If you have a management team, use an organizational chart to show your company’s internal structure, including the roles, responsibilities, and relationships between people in your chart. Communicate how each person will contribute to the success of your startup.

5. List your products and services.

Your products or services will feature prominently in most areas of your business plan, but it’s important to provide a section that outlines key details about them for interested readers.

If you sell many items, you can include more general information on each of your product lines. If you only sell a few, provide additional information on each. For example, bag shop BAGGU sells a large selection of different types of bags, in addition to home goods and other accessories. Its business plan would list out those categories and key details about the products within each.

Describe new products you’ll launch in the near future and any intellectual property you own. Express how they’ll improve profitability. It’s also important to note where products are coming from—handmade crafts are sourced differently than trending products for a dropshipping business, for instance.

6. Perform customer segmentation.

Your ideal customer, also known as your target market, is the foundation of your marketing plan, if not your business plan as a whole. You’ll want to keep this person in mind as you make strategic decisions, which is why an overview of who they are is important to understand and include in your plan.

To give a holistic overview of your ideal customer, describe a number of general and specific demographic characteristics. Customer segmentation often includes:

Where they live.

Their age range.

Their level of education.

Some common behavior patterns.

How they spend their free time.

Where they work.

What technology they use.

How much they earn.

Where they’re commonly employed.

Their values, beliefs, or opinions.

This information will vary based on what you’re selling, but you should be specific enough that it’s unquestionably clear who you’re trying to reach—and more importantly, why you’ve made the choices you have based on who your customers are and what they value.

For example, a college student has different interests, shopping habits, and pricing sensitivity than a 50-year-old executive at a Fortune 500 company. Your business plan and decisions would look very different based on which one was your ideal customer.

7. Define a marketing plan.

Your marketing efforts are directly informed by your ideal customer. Your marketing plan should outline your current decisions and your future strategy, with a focus on how your business idea is a fit for that ideal customer.

If you’re planning to invest heavily in Instagram marketing or TikTok ads, for example, it might make sense to include whether Instagram and TikTok are a leading platform for your audience—if it’s not, that might be a sign to rethink your marketing plan.

Most marketing plans include information on four key subjects. How much detail you present on each will depend on both your business and your plan’s audience.

Price: How much do your products cost, and why have you made that decision?

How much do your products cost, and why have you made that decision? Product: What are you selling and how do you differentiate it in the market?

What are you selling and how do you differentiate it in the market? Promotion: How will you get your products in front of your ideal customer?

How will you get your products in front of your ideal customer? Place: Where will you sell your products? On what channels and in which markets?

Promotion may be the bulk of your plan since you can more readily dive into tactical details, but the other three areas should be covered at least briefly—each is an important strategic lever in your marketing mix.

Here is an example of a marketing plan for a new business:

8. Provide a logistics and operations plan.

Logistics and operations are the workflows you’ll implement to make your business idea a reality. If you’re writing a business plan for your own planning purposes, this is still an important section to consider, even though you might not need to include the same level of detail as if you were seeking investment.

Cover all parts of your planned operations, including:

Suppliers . Where do you get the raw materials you need for production, or where are your products produced?

. Where do you get the raw materials you need for production, or where are your products produced? Production . Will you make, manufacture, wholesale, or dropship your products? How long does it take to produce your products and get them shipped to you? How will you handle a busy season or an unexpected spike in demand?

. Will you make, manufacture, wholesale, or dropship your products? How long does it take to produce your products and get them shipped to you? How will you handle a busy season or an unexpected spike in demand? Facilities . Where will you and any team members work? Do you plan to have a physical retail space? If yes, where?

. Where will you and any team members work? Do you plan to have a physical retail space? If yes, where? Equipment . What tools and technology do you require to be up and running? This includes everything from computers to lightbulbs and everything in between.

. What tools and technology do you require to be up and running? This includes everything from computers to lightbulbs and everything in between. Shipping and fulfillment. Will you be handling all the fulfillment tasks in-house, or will you use a third-party fulfillment partner?

Will you be handling all the fulfillment tasks in-house, or will you use a third-party fulfillment partner? Inventory. How much will you keep on hand, and where will it be stored? How will you ship it to partners if required, and how will you approach inventory management?

This section should signal to your reader that you’ve got a solid understanding of your supply chain and strong contingency plans in place to cover potential uncertainty. If your reader is you, it should give you a basis to make other important decisions, like how to price your products to cover your estimated costs, and at what point you plan to break even on your initial spending.

9. Make a financial plan.

No matter how great your idea is, and regardless of the effort, time, and money you invest, a business lives or dies based on its financial health. At the end of the day, people want to work with a business they expect to be viable for the foreseeable future.

The level of detail required in your financial plan will depend on your audience and goals, but typically you’ll want to include three major views of your financials: an income statement, a balance sheet, and a cash-flow statement. It also may be appropriate to include financial data and projections.

Here’s a spreadsheet template that includes everything you’ll need to create an income statement, balance sheet, and cash-flow statement, including some sample numbers. You can edit it to reflect projections if needed.

Let’s review the types of financial statements you’ll need.

Income statements

Your income statement is designed to give readers a look at your revenue sources and expenses over a given time period. With those two pieces of information, they can see the all-important bottom line or the profit or loss your business experienced during that time. If you haven’t launched your business yet, you can project future milestones of the same information.

Balance sheets

Your balance sheet offers a look at how much equity you have in your business. On one side, you list all your business assets (what you own), and on the other side, all your liabilities (what you owe). This provides a snapshot of your business’s shareholder equity, which is calculated as:

Assets - Liabilities = Equity

Cash flow statements

Your cash flow statement is similar to your income statement, with one important difference: it takes into account when revenues are collected and when expenses are paid.

When the cash you have coming in is greater than the cash you have going out, your cash flow is positive. When the opposite scenario is true, your cash flow is negative. Ideally, your cash flow statement will help you see when cash is low, when you might have a surplus, and where you might need to have a contingency plan to access funding to keep your business solvent.

It can be especially helpful to forecast your cash-flow statement to identify gaps or negative cash flow and adjust operations as required.

Why write a business plan?

Investors rely on business plans to evaluate the feasibility of a business before funding it, which is why business plans are commonly associated with getting a loan.

Business plans also help owners identify areas of weakness before launching, potentially avoiding costly mistakes down the road. “Laying out a business plan helped us identify the ‘unknowns’ and made it easier to spot the gaps where we’d need help or, at the very least, to skill up ourselves,” says Jordan Barnett, owner of Kapow Meggings.

There are several other compelling reasons to consider writing a business plan, including:

Strategic planning. Writing out your plan is an invaluable exercise for clarifying your ideas and can help you understand the scope of your business, as well as the amount of time, money, and resources you’ll need to get started.

If you’re looking for a structured way to lay out your thoughts and ideas, and to share those ideas with people who can have a big impact on your success, a business plan is an excellent starting point.

Business plan types

Business plan types can span from one page to multiple pages with detailed graphs and reports. There’s no one way to create a business plan. The goal is to convey the most important information about your company for readers.

Common business plans we see include, but are not limited to, the following types:

Traditional business plans

These are the most common business plans. Traditional business plans take longer to write and can be dozens of pages long. Venture capitalist firms and lenders ask for this plan. Traditional business plans may not be necessary if you don’t plan to seek outside funding. That’s where the next type comes in.

Lean business plans

A lean business plan is a shorter version of a traditional business plan. It follows the same format, but only includes the most important information. Businesses use lean business plans to onboard new hires or modify existing plans for a specific target market.

Nonprofit business plans

A nonprofit business plan is for any entity that operates for public or social benefit. It covers everything you’ll find in a traditional business plan, plus a section describing the impact the company plans to make. For example, a speaker and headphone brand that aims to help people with hearing disabilities. Donors often request this plan.

7 tips for creating a small business plan

There are a few best practices when it comes to writing a business plan. While your plan will be unique to your business and goals, keep these tips in mind as you write.

1. Know your audience.

When you know who will be reading your plan—even if you’re just writing it for yourself to clarify your ideas—you can tailor the language and level of detail to them. This can also help you make sure you’re including the most relevant information and figure out when to omit sections that aren’t as impactful.

2. Have a clear goal.

When creating a business plan, you’ll need to put in more work and deliver a more thorough plan if your goal is to secure funding for your business versus working through a plan for yourself or even your team.

3. Invest time in research.

Sections of your business plan will primarily be informed by your ideas and vision, but some of the most crucial information you’ll need requires research from independent sources. This is where you can invest time in understanding who you’re selling to, whether there’s demand for your products, and who else is selling similar products or services.

4. Keep it short and to the point.

No matter who you’re writing for, your business plan should be short and readable—generally no longer than 15 to 20 pages. If you do have additional documents you think may be valuable to your audience and your goals, consider adding them as appendices.

5. Keep the tone, style, and voice consistent.

This is best managed by having a single person write the plan or by allowing time for the plan to be properly edited before distributing it.

6. Use a business plan template.

You can also use a free business plan template to provide a skeleton for writing a plan. These often guide you through each section from financial projects to market research to mission statement ensuring you don’t miss a step.

7. Try business plan software.

Writing a business plan isn’t the easiest task for business owners. But it’s important for anyone starting or expanding a business. Fortunately, there are tools to help with everything from planning, drafting, creating graphics, syncing financial data, and more. Business plan software also has business plan templates and tutorials to help you finish a comprehensive plan in hours, rather than days.

A few curated picks include:

LivePlan: the most affordable option with samples and templates

Bizplan: tailored for startups seeking investment

Go Small Biz: budget-friendly option with industry-specific templates

Common mistakes when writing a business plan

Other articles on business plans would never tell you what we’re about to tell you: Your business plan can fail. The last thing you want is for time and effort to go down the drain. Avoid these common mistakes:

Bad business idea. Sometimes your idea may be too risky for potential investors, too expensive to run, or there’s no market. Aim for small business ideas that require low startup costs.

A great product is the cost of entry to starting a business. But an incredible team will take it to the top. Unfortunately, many business owners overlook a balanced team. They focus on potential profits, without worrying about how it will be done.

115,How We Created Our New Office Space Design to ...,https://www.columnfivemedia.com/how-our-office-space-design-maximizes-productivity/,,"Work happens anywhere and everywhere. And while there are many factors that influence satisfaction and productivity, our physical environment is a pretty big one. So when we decided to simplify our office space last year, we realized it was time to rethink how our space influences the way we work—and how we influence our space. Now that we’ve settled into our new space, we thought we’d offer a behind-the-scenes look at how we tweaked our office space design to increase our productivity and peace of mind.

Office Space: The Column Five Edition

Our current spot is the fourth incarnation of Column Five’s California headquarters. Over the last decade, we’ve moved from a cramped and (possibly illegal) attic space, to a warehouse, to a 11,000-foot office, and finally to our new office: a 4,000-foot space in The Culture Yard in Costa Mesa. Moving offices is a pain, of course, but we were actually excited for this one. Led by our ops team, we were better equipped than ever, knowing what worked and didn’t in each previous office space. And while planning our new space was a formidable task, we were ready to make some major changes.

The Challenges of Office Space Design

The biggest change came in how we approached our floor plan. Since day one, we swore we’d never have cubicles. Instead, like many organizations, we used open floor plans in every space. (In the early days it was the only way to fit everyone in.) But as our team has evolved, more people have gone remote, and we’re more aware of our individual work styles, we’ve realized that a totally open floor plan doesn’t work for us for several reasons.

Personal work styles. Introverts and extroverts can co-exist peacefully, but they have very different ideas of the ideal workspace. Introverts want privacy and cocooning to work or take a break. Extroverts like open spaces and visibility. We want everyone to have a sense of control and autonomy over their space, so we wanted to design a space that could work for both.

Flexibility. We were moving into a smaller office, which meant we needed a flexible layout that could provide space for both a company-wide meeting and a private call. We also didn’t want any space to go unused, as much of our larger office did, especially now that our team has the autonomy to work where they want.

Efficiency and logistics. While open floor plans seem nice, they can make it difficult to work around. For example, a kitchen blender could easily interrupt a conference call, and people’s entrances, exits, and mealtimes could disrupt other’s work. We needed a space that would help people do what they needed to do without affecting others.

Inspired by WeWork’s philosophy, we know we’re competing with people’s homes, so our office space design focused on blending comfort with functionality, streamlining the space, and helping people get—and stay—in flow.

Thus, we designed a new layout through the lense of behavior, intention, and mindfulness. Luckily, our ops team had the support of our aesthetically-minded designers, helping us create our best office design yet.

The Floorplan

During our research phase, we were heavily inspired by Cal Newport’s Deep Work, specifically his conversation with architect David Dewane, who created the concept of the Eudaimonia Machine, a unique floorplan designed to optimize human capability.

Inspired by Aristotle’s concept of eudaimonia (“the condition of human flourishing or of living well”), the Eudaimonia Machine is a design intended to guide people through spaces that trigger different emotions, ultimately ending in a space where they can do the most deep work.

For our office design, we looked for opportunities to infuse elements of the Eudaimonia Machine to provide an environment that served everyone’s needs. Thus, we designed our own interpretation of the Eudaimonia Machine’s five main spaces, as described by Newport in Deep Work.

1) The Gallery

Newport’s description: “The first room you enter when coming off the street is called the gallery. In Dewane’s plan, this room would contain examples of deep work produced in the building. It’s meant to inspire users of the machine, creating a ‘culture of healthy stress and peer pressure.’”

We call ours The Great Room. It’s the room you enter through, a bright, airy, and welcoming space that sets the emotional tone for the day. Here, you can greet a coworker, grab a coffee, and get in the headspace to start your work.

It includes the kitchen (an inherently social place), booths (allowing for coworking or semi-privacy), a large counter island, café tables, and auditorium seating for our all-company meetings.

It’s a public, highly social and interactive space, the best place for noisy spillover. That said, we try to follow “library rules” in our public spaces, allowing for social interaction but still being cognizant of others.

2) The Salon

Newport’s description: “The Salon is designed to create a mood that ‘hovers between intense curiosity and argumentation.’ This is a place to debate, ‘brood,’ and in general work through the ideas that you’ll develop deeper in the machine.”

For us, this space is our hallway, lined with conference rooms and two phone rooms of varying sizes.

These rooms are where we do our main collaborative work. All have phones, all are public spaces (featuring glass doors and storefront windows along hallway). We hold meetings, entertain clients, do presentations, talk, and brainstorm in these spaces.

3) The Library

Newport’s description: “Beyond the salon you enter the library. This room stores a permanent record of all work produced in the machine, as well as the books and other resources used in this previous work.”

Our library is a creative nook space, featuring large a table with drawers, high stools, and shelves on the walls for books, ephemera, and knick knacks.Here we keep the resources we need for more physical work (such as papercraft) and other supplies. It also includes a chalkboard wall to doodle for inspiration, roadmap a project, or write a friendly message.

4) The Office

Newport’s description: “The next room is the office space. It contains a standard conference room with a whiteboard and some cubicles with desks.”

As we incorporated conference rooms into our salon space, our office includes a large, open floor desk area, ideal for low-intensity activities. Here we have assigned desks, as well as unassigned desks well-appointed for anyone who needs to use them (including second monitors, dongle baskets, etc.). This environment is a throwback to our open floor plan—without the distractions.

5) The Chamber

Newport’s description: “This brings us to the final room of the machine, a collection of what Dewane calls ‘deep work chambers.’…’The purpose of the deep work chamber is to allow for total focus and uninterrupted work flow,’ Dewane explains.”

We have renamed this The Cavern. It’s a quiet space, painted a dark color. It has a door for privacy, and there is no talking or music allowed. This allows people to do deep work in a designated space.

Overall, each space has its own personality, but everything works symbiotically. For the overall aesthetic, we wanted to strike a balance between the coziness of a college student union (without the shabbiness) and the style of a designed space (without being too sterile).

To achieve this, we focused on natural materials, plenty of plants, and a bright, cheerful, and colorful palette that isn’t too visually “loud.” We’re also lucky to have a garage door, allowing natural light and air to flood our main space.

Ultimately, our goal was to create a space that was joyful, warm, welcoming, and comfortable. Thus far, it’s served our needs well—and made us even more eager to work more efficiently. Since moving in, we’ve taken major steps toward eliminating unnecessary processes, collaborating more effectively, and increasing productivity. (You can learn more about how we recently rebuilt our production process with AgencyAgile techniques as part of this push.)

As happiness researcher Gretchen Rubin says, “outer order contributes to inner calm,” so we’re glad to have an office that helps make our work lives happier—from the minute we step into the office each day.

Of course, we’d also like to give a special shoutout to the people who helped take on this enormous task: Our Cofounder Ross Crooks, VP of People and Culture Tamara Hlava, Office Manager Leanne Robinson, Creative Director Nate Butler, Designer Jenny Famularcano, Chris Cuaso Design, and Chris Pearson and Dave Macbeth at Macbeth Millwork. We couldn’t have done it without their work, insight, and talent.

464,How a Remote Work Strategy Allows Expansion of Talent ...,https://stegmeierconsulting.com/remote/how-a-remote-work-strategy-allows-expansion-of-talent-pool/,,"Broadening your company’s talent pool by formalizing your remote work strategy

Cultivating talent pool through remote work hiring

Remote work has gone beyond a trend and is now a business strategy that many employers are exploring because of the numerous doors of opportunity that it opens.

At first glance, remote work may be primarily perceived as more beneficial to employees. They can gain flexibility with their time and schedules, as well as save on the many expenses that come along with working in an office – commute, lunches, after-office gatherings, and even money spent for office clothes.

Add to that the many non-monetary advantages for workers – more time with family, the chance to travel more freely, improved physical and mental health, and the chance to work for a company regardless of geographical location.

A lot of workers, especially millennials, tend to value the non-monetary rewards of working from home. In that regard, many employees may be okay with earning a little less base pay, rather than getting a higher salary for an in-office job. They would rather be flexible and avoid the hustle and bustle of daily work commute and office life in general.

Consider as well, the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic that has forced people to distance themselves from each other. Remote work is a practical choice that employers are increasingly recognizing as a workplace strategy that allows employees to still contribute greatly while providing ample benefits to both the organization and the individual.

Many of the aforementioned benefits are actually great advantages for businesses, too. Beyond significant real estate savings, the chance to hire based on talent and skill becomes more important yet accessible with geographic hiring boundaries erased.

With remote work, you open the doors to a talent pool outside of your business location and in some cases, reduce the need to train new hires for specific skills, as there is a greater chance to recruit someone already proficient in the skill set required for that job role.

Benefits of an expanded remote talent pool for your Business

Lower cost, higher profitability

Increased profitability is one of the most attractive remote work benefits for a business. Being able to drastically reduce operational costs by hiring remote workers is possible. With the right remote work pay strategy, businesses can hire top talent while achieving significant cost reductions.

Businesses can operate in smaller office spaces when increasing the number of employees regularly assigned to work from home–a big win in terms of cost reduction for the company. Square footage can be freed up to either better accommodate on-site employees’ work styles, or offices can be eliminated entirely for those seeking to become a remote-first organization.

Better talent pool, higher productivity

Formalizing remote work allows businesses to acquire talent that once was inaccessible. It increases options so widely, that internal recruiters will most easily encounter the right person to hire in terms of skill sets. With it easier to identify candidates with the right skill set, employers can shift focus to attitude, mindset, and cultural fit of potential new hires, ultimately, enabling your company to grow with the kind of skilled team players that focus on quality and productivity.

Diverse talents, greater impact

With an increased focus lately on diversity, equity, and inclusion, companies can hone in on hiring employees of different backgrounds and personal experiences.

With remote work, you open your doors to talented and skilled people who could not work in your office for one reason or another. This includes caregivers who cannot work in an office due to familial obligations, as well as individuals who can’t travel to or work in an office setup due to physical limitations or health conditions. Limiting factors that have nothing to do with a person’s capacity to perform well are now removed from the equation.

Inclusion efforts can be greatly aided by thoughtful remote work hiring–a definite advantage in terms of creating a company image that attracts quality employees.

More talent options, higher employee retention

with remote work becoming a preferred working lifestyle for more and more people, those who are given the latitude to work remotely are more likely to stay rooted in the company.

In many cases, these employees are farther removed from office politics and gossip, a factor that often can drive turnover. In a remote setup, employees can create an environment that allows them to work in a manner they prefer, mitigating, in part, the likelihood of a desire to make a change.

So long as your organization’s work from home policies are aligned with employees’ needs, and compensation is reasonable, many of the usual reasons employees quit won’t even bubble to the surface in a remote scenario. Of course, higher retention is beneficial for a company, as it lessens the need to train new hires often, and it promotes a culture of loyalty, while people continue to learn skills and help the business thrive.

Offer remote work, stay ahead of the game

The COVID-19 pandemic has ushered tons of employers into the remote work world. The sooner you can formalize your remote work strategy the sooner you can gain a competitive advantage over other businesses, both in your town and in your industry.

While some employers dabble in remote work, others choose to holistically assess their remote work strategy and approach to hiring work from home employees.

Start collecting data and feedback from your employees who have already been working at home, and check the pulse of your people. Do they want to stay remote? Do they want to go back to the office? What are we gaining from operating as a remote team? There are many items for your company to discuss and plan when formalizing your remote work strategy, much of which we’ve included on this section of our website.

As you look to differentiate yourself as an employer of choice, an augmented talent pool gives you a marked competitive edge over those that fail to acknowledge the benefits or refuse to adapt to remote work.

Challenges of hiring remote workers

With greater opportunity through remote work hiring also comes challenges that companies, especially those unfamiliar with the setup, may ultimately encounter.

One big challenge is determining which among the job roles in your organization can work remotely, and which will need to stay in an office. When planning this out, consider the tasks and roles of each employee and department. The relevance of this process is dependent on the type of business, and therefore requires careful planning and consideration.

For instance, some businesses may be comfortable with accounting and sales working remotely, but for other positions that require special tools or technology that may only be located on-site, this would not be possible. With SCG’s years of experience in workplace observation and insight gathering, these factors can be explored and studied to help determine the best course of action for your business and your employees.

Another challenge is considering how your company can adapt to remote work hiring. Remote onboarding requires an entirely new approach compared to how typical hiring works, as additional factors need to be calculated into the hiring process.

Lastly, while it has been mentioned that there is greater success in hiring remote workers that can immediately fit the role you need (thanks to an expanded talent pool), there will still be cases when training and extra effort are required.

This is especially true during instances when a worker is tasked with a role that requires knowledge and skills that may be “foreign” to them — knowing market trends in a different city or country or understanding a culture different from what they know, are just some examples.

Thankfully, with the right training, and having the mindset that skills can be taught and learned, a remote worker can adapt and win over these challenges. By focusing more closely in the hiring process on personality, attitude, loyalty, and other positive traits, coupled with a determination to train them thoroughly, your remote workers will become valuable assets to your business, in as much as in-office employees are.

Overall, these challenges can be tied to how much change will be needed to transition to a remote work environment. With whatever changes your company needs to undergo, SCG can assist you in managing change and shift into a new chapter of your business smoothly and successfully.

How SCG can help create steps and avoid challenges in a remote work environment

SCG can help you understand all the changes that this transition brings, and work with you to develop the strategies to overcome challenges along the way.

Google

“If history has taught us anything, it is that when disruptors and pioneers are right, society always recalibrates.”

Googlers feel like they are really living in the future. Because Google is one of the top technology companies in the world, it's no surprise that employees are at the forefront of technology.

Googlers get to use the company's products to get work done and beta-test products that haven't been released to the public yet. They are encouraged to spend 80% of their time on core projects and 20% of their time on innovation activities that peak their own personal interests.

Google is known for its tech talks, presentations and lectures on various topics that are open to employees to either attend or watch remotely. We strive to provide inspiring spaces to work, recharge, and collaborate with fellow Googlers.

Want to learn how to code or bake a cake? Google also offers partial reimbursements for both professional and personal classes to support many Googlers’ desire to continue to grow and develop in ways that are important to them.

Adapt also the .travis.yml file to build the new image at Travis.

Git Repositories

https://github.com/yast/docker-yast-cpp

https://github.com/yast/docker-yast-ruby

https://github.com/yast/docker-libstorage-ng

https://github.com/libyui/docker-devel

Build the new Docker Images

:information_source: You need access permissions to the yastdevel and libyui organizations at the Docker Hub.

Update the Docker Hub configuration to build the new defined images

https://cloud.docker.com/u/yastdevel/repository/docker/yastdevel/cpp/builds/edit

https://cloud.docker.com/u/yastdevel/repository/docker/yastdevel/ruby/builds/edit

https://cloud.docker.com/u/yastdevel/repository/docker/yastdevel/libstorage-ng/builds/edit

https://cloud.docker.com/u/libyui/repository/docker/libyui/devel/builds/edit

The New Docker Setup

Since SLE-15-SP2 we use the new Docker images built directly in the OBS.

You need to create the images and the containers build targets in OBS and configure them to properly build the expected result in the project config:

%if ""%_repository"" == ""images"" Type: kiwi Repotype: none Patterntype: none %endif %if ""%_repository"" == ""containers"" Type: docker Repotype: none Patterntype: none %endif

The Base Image

We need to create the base image for the new branch. Either reuse the TW image or check the OBS templates for the respective Leap release version:

https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/YaST:Head/opensuse-tumbleweed-image:docker

https://build.opensuse.org/image_templates

Note: We should build the base image locally, the official Leap images might be dropped or disabled at some point, SLE has much longer lifetime...

Git Repositories

Create the respective branch also in these repositories containing the Docker images:

https://github.com/yast/ci-cpp-container

https://github.com/yast/ci-ruby-container

https://github.com/yast/ci-libstorage-ng-container

Make sure the Rakefile properly defines the submit target.

Jenkins Jobs

The changes in the Git repositories above should be automatically submitted by the Jenkins jobs to OBS. When adding a new branch we need to add a new job for it.

See the yast-ci-* jobs at https://ci.opensuse.org/view/Yast/, defined in the yast-jobs.yaml file.

Creating the Branches

For creating the branch and adapting the Rakefile and Dockerfile files use the create_maintenance_branch script. Run it in the Git checkout of the respective package.

Some packages might need a special adaptation for a new release, check the affected packages below.

To get the list of the packages packages which needs to be branched you might query the IBS like this:

(osc -A https://api.suse.de ls SUSE:SLE-15:GA; osc -A https://api.suse.de ls SUSE:SLE-15-SP1:GA) \ | grep yast | sort -u

Note: you need to list all previous service packs including the original GA release, the SP repositories only contain the updated packages, the unchanged packages are inherited from the previous releases.

Enabling Branch Protection

The newly added branches should be protected by GitHub (to avoid force pushes, accidental branch removal and enforce code reviews). To do this globally use the protect_branches.rb helper script.

Jenkins Setup

The sync job from IBS to OBS has to be added at https://gitlab.suse.de/yast/infra.

See the Jenkins Job Builder (JJB) documentation

Make sure you have the JJB packages installed, run zypper install python3-jenkins-job-builder to install it

to install it Testing before deploying: jenkins-jobs --conf jenkins/ci.suse.de.ini test jenkins/ci.suse.de/ '*SP5*'

Deploying: jenkins-jobs --conf jenkins/ci.suse.de.ini update jenkins/ci.suse.de/ '*SP5*'

Modifying Specific Packages

Some packages might contain a release specific data. Ideally we should avoid that but here are listed some exceptions which need a special care:

The skelcd-control-leanos package contains the SP release version in the <full_system_media_name> tag in the control.leanos.xml file. Also check whether the <full_system_download_url> value is correct.

Translations

For new branches where translations are required the SUSE Localization Team has to be informed. Also when branching cause that master is no longer in sync with the last SLE SP, Jenkins job syncing translations needs to be modified at https://gitlab.suse.de/yast/infra/-/merge_requests/74/diffs#432aa131b22a799c7a568113cf2ce645b0930a75_29_31 (internal link only).",planning to open new branch
477,How to Create a Great Customer Experience Strategy,https://www.superoffice.com/blog/customer-experience-strategy/,,"Table Of Contents

We surveyed 1,920 business professionals and asked them what the top business priority is for the next 5 years - and once again, the same answer came out on top.

Can you guess what the top priority for a business is?

If you guessed ‘customer experience’ (or CX), you guessed right.

More than 45% of organizations are investing more into CX, up from just 36% in 2010.

It’s no surprise that customer experience is so high.

Research by Shep Hyken found that 58% of customers are willing to pay more for a better experience.

Meanwhile, the Temkin Group published a study and found that companies that earn $1 billion annually can expect to earn, on average, an additional $700 million within 3 years of investing in customer experience.

That's a 80% increase in revenue within 36 months!

Put simply:

Companies who successfully implement a customer experience strategy achieve higher customer satisfaction rates, reduced customer churn and increased revenues.

Sounds like a win-win, right?

it's no surprise that 80% of organizations will be investing more into the customer experience this year year.

Ready to increase your investment and improve your customers` experience?

Let's get started.

What is customer experience?

Customer experience (also known as CX) is defined by the interactions and experiences your customer has with your business throughout the entire customer journey, from first contact to becoming a happy and loyal customer.

CX is an integral part of Customer Relationship Management (CRM) and the reason why it’s important is because a customer who has a positive experience with a business is more likely to become a repeat and loyal customer.

One of the biggest benefits of customer experience is higher profits.

In fact, CX-focused brands report profits that are 60 percent higher than those that fail to focus on CX. If you want your customers to stay loyal, you have to invest in their experience!

Simply put, happy customers remain loyal.

It makes sense, right?

The happier you are with a brand, the longer you stay with them. So, if you treat your customers poorly or ignore their customer service emails, then they are more likely to stop doing business with you. This is why companies that deliver a superior customer experience outperform their competitors - and this means they'll be spending more with your business (and less in theirs!).

For example, here's a few statistics that caught our eye:

Customer experience is set to be the number one brand differentiator

1 in 3 customers will leave a brand they love after just one bad experience,

will leave a brand they love after just one bad experience, Customers are willing to pay a price premium of up to 13% (and as high as 18%) for luxury and indulgence services, simply by receiving a great customer experience,

(and as high as 18%) for luxury and indulgence services, simply by receiving a great customer experience, Companies that prioritize customer experience report a revenue increase of 4-8% above their competitors

above their competitors 49% of buyers have made impulse purchases after receiving a more personalized customer experience.

have made impulse purchases after receiving a more personalized customer experience. Customers that rate companies with a high customer experience score (i.e. 10/10) spend 140% more and remain loyal for up to 6 years.

So, it's extremely important that you focus on improving the experience you offer your customers.

And we're not just talking about customer service....

Is customer experience the same as customer service?

No. And here's why.

In most cases, a customer’s first point of contact with a company is usually by interacting with an employee (either by visiting a store or by speaking on the phone). This gives your business an opportunity to deliver great customer service.

However, customer service is only one aspect of the entire customer experience.

For instance, when booking a vacation over the phone, good customer service is evident when the person assisting you is friendly and helpful.

However, a great customer experience goes way beyond that.

For example, it's when your tickets arrive ahead of time, you get an extra special discount and the hotel surprises you with a room upgrade right when you enter the door.

That's how these two differ.

Like most things in today’s marketplace, customer experience has changed – it’s more than person-to-person service and thanks to technology, companies can connect with their customers in new and exciting ways.

For example, using CRM software, you can view customer purchase history and to predict future needs even before the customer knows they need it. Having the ability to predict a future need will let you be proactive and attentive and, it means you can do things like;

Provide related products based on purchase history

Create and deliver targeted email marketing campaigns

Understand the 360 degree view of the customer

Customer service is still as important as ever, but it’s no longer the sole focus of the customer experience. Now, the customer experience brings new ways to strengthen customer relationships through technological breakthroughs.

How important is the customer experience?

A business cannot exist without its customers, and this is why companies are focusing on how to win new business and, perhaps more importantly, retain existing customers.

Did you know that companies that prioritize great customer experience see a significant increase in their revenue?

Plus, a survey by Bloomberg Businessweek found that “delivering a great customer experience” has become a top strategic objective.

And a survey by Customer Management IQ survey found that 75% of customer experience management executives and leaders rated customer experience a ‘5’ on a scale of 1-5 (5 being of the highest importance).

The challenge here is that even though it's a high priority, most companies are failing to deliver a good customer experience.

When Bain & Company asked organizations to rate their quality of customer experience, 80% believe they are delivering a superior experience. This is compared to only 8% of customers who believe they are receiving a great customer experience.

So how many brands are truly delivering an excellent customer experience?

Surprisingly, not too many.

In fact, less than half of all companies deliver a good (or excellent) customer experience.

Customer expectations are rising, faster than the speed that companies can improve their customer experience. Customers expect every interaction, end-to-end, to be the best experience they have with any company - not just yours!

To effectively enhance customer experiences, businesses should deeply integrate digital innovations into their customer engagement strategies.

By leveraging CRM technology and artificial intelligence, organizations can dive into vast amounts of data to unearth insights and accurately predict customer preferences and behaviors.

This proactive approach enables the delivery of highly customized interactions and services, directly addressing individual needs and expectations.

Such personalized engagement not only elevates the overall customer journey but also fosters a stronger, more meaningful connection between businesses and their customers, setting the stage for lasting loyalty and satisfaction.

SuperOffice CRM gives you a holistic view of each customer by capturing every interaction in one platform - from sales, marketing and customer service. You can use this data to provide a better customer experience.

Impact of bad customer experiences

If a great customer experience is focused on ensuring all interactions and touchpoints with your business are easy, enjoyable, and seamless, then the exact opposite is true when it comes to a bad customer experience.

More than $62 billion is lost each year to bad customer service. Meanwhile, another study found 91% of unhappy customers leave a brand without complaining.

It doesn’t get any better. Only 10% of consumers say brands meet expectations for a good experience.

Some of the most common causes for bad customer experiences involve:

Difficult purchasing processes

Negative experiences with customer support

Compromising a customer’s personal security

Waiting too long on hold

Ignoring customer feedback

So, the question remains: how can your organization improve customer experience?

9 ways to Create a customer experience strategy

Let’s take a look at how to create a great CX strategy, which include customer experience best practices sucn as ways to improve customer satisfaction, reduce churn and increase revenues (including examples).

Create a clear customer experience vision

The first step in your customer experience strategy is to have a clear customer-focused vision that you can communicate with your organization. The easiest way to define this vision is to create a set of statements that act as guiding principles.

For example, Zappos use their core family values and these values are embedded into their culture, which includes delivering wow through service, being humble and embracing change.

Once these principles are in place, they will drive the behavior of your organization. Every member of your team should know these principles by heart and they should be embedded into all areas of training and development.

Understand who your customers are

The next step in building upon these customer experience principles is to bring to life the different types of customers who deal with your customer support teams. If your organization is going to really understand customer needs and wants, then they need to be able to connect and empathize with the situations that your customers face.

One way to do this is to segment your customers and create personas (or customer profiles). Try to give each persona a name and personality. For example, Anne is 35 years old; she likes new technology and is tech savvy enough to follow a video tutorial on her own, whereas John (42 years old) needs to be able to follow clear instructions on a web page.

By creating personas, your customer support team can recognize who they are and understand them better. It's also an important step in becoming truly customer centric.

Create an emotional connection with your customers

You’ve heard the phrase “it’s not what you say; it’s how you say it”?

Well, the best customer experiences are achieved when a member of your team creates an emotional connection with a customer.

One of the best examples of creating an emotional connection comes from Zappos:

When a customer was late on returning a pair of shoes due to her mother passing away. When Zappos found out what happened, they took care of the return shipping and had a courier pick up the shoes without cost. But, Zappos didn't stop there. The next day, the customer arrived home to a bouquet of flowers with a note from the Zappos Customer Success team who sent their condolences.

Research by the Journal of Consumer Research has found that more than 50% of an experience is based on an emotion as emotions shape the attitudes that drive decisions.

Customers become loyal because they are emotionally attached and they remember how they feel when they use a product or service. A business that optimizes for an emotional connection outperforms competitors by 85% in sales growth.

A positive experience for customers means a lot, studies prove time and again:

64% of consumers are more likely to recommend a brand to others if it offers simpler experiences and communications.

71% of people recommend a product or service because they received a “great experience”.

65% of all consumers find a positive experience with a brand to be more influential than great advertising

Capture customer feedback in real time

How can you tell if you are delivering a WOW customer experience?

You need to ask – And ideally you do this by capturing feedback in real time. Use live chat tools to have real time conversations and when done, send a follow up email to every customer using post-interaction surveys and similar customer experience tools.

SuperOffice Service helps you collect feedback in real time, through email-based support, live chat and a self-service knowledge base.

Of course, it’s possible to make outbound sales calls to customers in order to gain more insightful feedback.

It’s also important to tie customer feedback to a specific customer support agent, which shows every team member the difference they are making to the business.

Use a quality framework for development of your team

By following the steps above, you now know what customers think about the quality of your service compared to the customer experience principles you have defined. The next step is to identify the training needs for each individual member of your customer support team.

Many organizations assess the quality of phone and email communication, however, a quality framework takes this assessment one step further by scheduling and tracking your teams development through coaching, eLearning and group training.

Act upon regular employee feedback

Most organizations have an annual survey process where they capture the overall feedback of your team; how engaged they are and the businesses ability to deliver an exceptional service.

But, what happens in the 11 months between these survey periods?

Usually, nothing happens. And this is where continuous employee feedback can play a role using tools that allow staff to share ideas on how to improve the customer experience and for managers to see how staff is feeling towards the business.

For example, using project management software or social media tools, you can create a closed environment where your organization can leave continuous feedback.

Measure the ROI from delivering great customer experience

And finally, how do you know if all this investment in your teams, process and technology are working and paying off?

The answer is in the business results.

One of the biggest customer experience challenges is measurement, which is why many companies use the “Net Promoter Score” or NPS, which collects valuable information by asking a single straightforward question:

""How likely are you to recommend us?""

NPS, which was created by Rob Markey and Fred Reichheld at Bain and Company, is a highly suitable benchmark for a customer experience metric because a lot of companies use it as the standard customer experience measurement.

And the fact that it’s simple to implement and measure makes the NPS a favorite with company boards and executive committees.

We’ve used NPS at SuperOffice for several years now. Driven by our Director of Customer Experience, Hans Christian Gronsleth, here’s how NPS impacts the SuperOffice customer experience.

Personalize the experience

When it comes to improving the customer experience, a lot of it boils down to personalization.

Did you know that around 40% of consumers would like to see ads that are personalized based on their interests?

You can greatly enhance your customer satisfaction rates by tailoring the experiences to your customers’ specific needs and preferences.

We recommend using customer data and analytics to collect insights about their past interactions, preferences and buying history. Use this information wisely to personalize your communication, recommendation and targeted offers.

Don't have the resouces in place? Leverage AI for your customer experience.

Create a seamless omnichannel experience

Your customers demand a seamless experience across various touchpoints and channels.

In fact, roughly 73% of shoppers favor using multiple channels for their shopping needs.

That’s why you need to make sure your customers are able to connect and engage with your company consistently - no matter which platform, channel or device they’re using.

It’s also highly recommended that you implement strategies that provide those smooth transitions between platforms, like for example synchronized communication, unified customer database and integrated customer service.

Optimize the customer journey

When it comes to creating a great customer experience, it’s important to consider the entire customer journey.



McKinsey research suggests that customer journeys are significantly more strongly correlated with business outcomes than are touchpoints.



This means you need a clear understanding of the end-to-end experiences with customers and how interactions at each point are received.



Focusing on a customer’s journey, and identifying the problems within them, offers new opportunities to create a great customer experience. This also enables your teams to brainstorm ideas to reduce friction, improve business relationships, and increase growth.

When it comes to performance, a customer journey is “30% to 40% more strongly correlated with customer satisfaction than performance on touchpoints is - and 20% to 30% more strongly correlated with business outcomes.”

Conclusion

Customer expectations are higher than ever and word of mouth travels fast!

And as the customer becomes even more empowered, it increases the importance of the customer experience.

Improving the customer experience is an area that needs constant nurturing and care. With a greater focus on thier CX strategy, companies will realize a positive impact on customer loyalty, higher retention and increased revenue growth.

Companies like Sharp, Bridge Technologies and SBC use SuperOffice CRM to deliver a better, more personalized experience for their customers.

Customers also ask:

What are the main components of customer experience (CX)?

The three main components for creating a customer experience strategy are discovery, engagement and delivery.

What are the main objectives of customer experience management (CXM)?

The main objective of customer experience management is to improve each interaction a customer has with your brand. It is to understand the quality of experience you think you deliver versus the experience you actually deliver - and then fill in the gaps.

What’s the difference between CRM and CXM?

While both CRM and CXM focus on the customer and improving their experiences, CRM is a platform used to keep track of customers, CXM is a strategic goal for the entire organization.

How can a company effectively measure the impact of a customer experience strategy on overall business performance?

Companies can measure the impact of a customer experience strategy using various metrics, such as Net Promoter Score (NPS), Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT), and Customer Effort Score (CES). Additionally, tracking changes in customer retention rates, repeat purchase rates, and customer lifetime value can provide insights into the strategy's effectiveness. Monitoring these metrics before and after implementing a customer experience strategy can reveal its impact on business performance.

What are some common challenges businesses face when trying to implement a customer experience strategy, and how can they be overcome?

Common challenges include lack of company-wide alignment on customer experience goals, inadequate understanding of customer needs, and insufficient integration of customer feedback into business processes. To overcome these, businesses should foster a customer-centric culture across all departments, conduct thorough market research to understand customer expectations, and regularly gather and analyze customer feedback.

Can you provide specific examples of businesses that have successfully transformed their customer experience and the strategies they used?

One notable example is Apple, which focuses on creating a seamless and intuitive user experience across all its products and services. Their strategy includes meticulous attention to product design, user-friendly interfaces, and providing exceptional in-store and after-sales service. Companies that prioritize customer experience can see a positive impact on their business success.

415,How to Create a New Branch on GitHub‍,https://ottomatik.io/post/how-to-create-a-new-branch-on-github,,"How to Create a New Branch on GitHub

One of Git's fundamental ideas is branching, which enables one to work on a specific feature without impacting other code. If you use Git, you've undoubtedly made branches a lot, but there are a few different methods to accomplish so.

This allows developers to make changes securely before deciding whether to discard them or incorporate them into the rest of the project. Knowing these various approaches and their benefits may make working with Git easier. Having a clear workflow is crucial to maintaining your Git repository, and it includes how and when you generate branches. Your project may end up in disarray if there are too many of them or if they aren't created at the appropriate time. Your branching approach is important because of this.

In this post, you'll learn more about Git's data architecture and how to create branches using the command line, the GitHub web interface, or orphan branches, as well as the benefits of each technique.

â

â

Git Logs and Data Model

Git records every modification you make to your code. Your commits create a continuous history of your project that can be inspected and revisited.

This allows you to go back in time and examine what modifications were done. By doing so, you may go back and review the modifications that were made during an earlier stage of development.

Users can inspect the commit record by typing:

git log

That will show all your commits. You can shorten it by adding the number of commits you wish to see as a parameter. To view the last ten commits, for example, type:

git log -20

â

The Git Branch Command

The command line is the most often used method of working with Git. Except in the case of orphan branches (more on that later), new branches are normally based on existing ones.

To establish a new branch, open the command line, which will be Bash on Mac and Linux or the command prompt on Windows. Before you begin, navigate to the folder containing your repository.

This is the easiest way to do it:Â

git checkout -b

That creates the branch and switches straight to it. If you donât want to switch to it, run:

git branch

and switch to the new branch later with:

git checkout â

This approach is simple and has no significant drawbacks. If you use it locally, your changes will not be visible to others until you push to the remote branch, so if you delay too long before updating it, your version of the repo may deviate from the master copy.

Try typing:

git checkout -b

to generate a branch based on an existing one.

Branches can also be created based on certain tags or commits. To employ a tag, enter:

git checkout -b

Or for a commit via:

git checkout -b

where symbolic_reference is replaced by something like HEAD~3, or a reference to the commit you want to branch from.

The DAG

Git creates a log of changes to your repository using objects and references. Objects include particular commits, trees that refer to objects, and blob files that describe your files.

They all flow in the same way and may be seen as a directed acyclic graph, or DAG. Branches and tags, both of which refer to commits, are examples of references.

Here is a pretty simple command-line representation of the DAG you can try:

git log --graph --decorate --oneline

â

GitKraken, for example, can generate visuals for you. As your repo becomes more sophisticated, having a visual perspective of where you are and where you've been will assist you in determining your future steps.

â

Orphan Branches

Sometimes you want to share a branch with someone but don't want them to view the complete project history. A fresh orphan branch is an answer since it is generated from scratch with no commit history.Â

â

Create it using:

git checkout --orphan

â

Additionally, if you wish to work separately or start again with a fresh branch, this is helpful. Perhaps you're satisfied with the project's prior history and wish to start a fresh log here.

Other uses of orphan branches combine numerous repositories, establishing a separate documentation branch, or building a branch for a static site are all examples.

The GitHub Online Interface

GitHub's browser interface allows you to execute the most frequent actions on the site. Go to the project website to start a new branch. At the upper left, you'll see the branch you're presently in listedâusually, master or main.

If you click it, it will expand and reveal a text area. There will also be a list of existing branches, which will only include the one branch you created before creating others.

In the text area, type the name of the new branch. You'll see text below detailing what will happen, such as ""Build branch: foo from main."" Press Return.

If you wish to branch from an existing branch, just switch to it before establishing the new one. You may also create branches from specified items, such as commits or tags. If you select the Tags tab next to the list of branches, you'll get a list of possible tags to use. GitHub's site is quick, accessible, and user-friendly, making it a fantastic alternative for users who aren't yet familiar with the command line. It gives you a lot of information at a look, so you can clearly see your possibilities.

This is a good place to start if you're new to Git. You may experiment painlessly by making a fake project.

â

Other Git Branching Options

Git can be managed in numerous ways. There are desktop and mobile applications for GitHub. You may browse the commit history using these, which include all the functionality you'd anticipate. You also get helpful code diffs that let you quickly see what has been added. This method of browsing your team's code can help you keep track of everyone's contributions.

Git can also be used from a web-based interface on other websites, including GitLab. These have grown in popularity and providedÂ solid alternatives to the bigger platform after GitHub was purchased by Microsoft.

Git support is available in many IDEs as well, enabling branch operations. Additionally, Git is supported by NetBeans and all of its various offshoots. In the event that your IDE doesn't natively support Git, it could have a plugin that does.

Which Branching Strategy to Use

Now that you know how to make branches, think about when to use them to make the most of your flow strategy. Git flow is a primitive technique that uses many branches for distinct objectives.

It integrates nicely with conventional release models and enables you to plan the development of features and group them for particular releases.

A more recent option is GitHub flow, which seeks to make things simpler by employing feature-specific branches that are removed after merging. Small teams who wish to compartmentalize their work without adding too much complexity would love it. As your team expands, though, things could become complicated.

In order to give you the best of both worlds, GitLab flow has fewer branches than Git flow but more branches overall to accommodate scenarios that GitHub flow struggles to handle.

Which is ideal for you will depend on the size of your team and the basic procedures you have in place. For larger projects, the extra release branches and optional staging and production branches help you manage things efficiently.

Conclusion

Branches are an effective design element. You can divide work across your team more safely if you know how to build them and when to do so. You can divide work across your team more safely if you know how to build them and when to do so.Â

Your project will be simpler to work on and your repo structure will be more consistent if you can persuade everyone to cooperate better. Your repo's use will be optimized if you employ a specific branching strategy as part of a specified Git workflow.

693,How to Develop Strategic Initiatives (and How to Execute ...,https://www.achieveit.com/resources/blog/how-to-develop-strategic-initiatives-and-how-to-execute-them/,,"Strategic plan, strategic initiative, strategic priority, strategic project and the list goes on. These terms are thrown around in businesses all the time.

Organizations of all sizes regularly pour considerable resources into developing and implementing a new plan. This plan maps out where they are now and where they want to be.

And these plans are full of priorities, goals, strategies, projects and more. But if done correctly, the items deemed as strategic initiatives will position the organization for success in the future.

However, many organizations miss a crucial step. Not all initiatives meet the criteria for being “strategic.” Our guide to strategic initiatives will help walk you through the planning stages and execution of your company’s strategy.

In This Article

What Are Strategic Initiatives and Why You Should Have Them

A strategic plan is a detailed plan that helps organizations achieve their goals and long-term visions. Strategic initiatives outline the specific steps an organization must complete in order to make its strategic plan a reality. These initiatives are the first physical objectives of an organization’s strategy and are essential to the strategy’s execution and development. In many cases, initiatives comprise several different projects or strategies that function together and create a larger plan your company strives to achieve.

A strategic initiative should prioritize a few characteristics:

Defined goals

Concrete steps

Organized schedules and timelines

Milestones

Budgets

Progress gauging

But just because it has these elements, doesn’t mean that your initiative is “strategic”.

For an initiative to be strategic, it should meet the following criteria:

It will help achieve organizational strategic goals and position the company to better deliver value for clients and shareholders It implies a change or improvement, making it distinct from day-to-day operations Resources, capital, and capacity are prioritized and deployed to implement the initiative

If the initiative meets all three of the above criteria, it is likely a strategic initiative.

If in doubt, ask yourself the following questions:

Of all the things we’ve planned to do, which are the most important to get right to accomplish our goals? If we only had the resources to dedicate towards three (or four or five) initiatives, which would they be?

These should be your strategic initiatives. It’s critical to recognize and differentiate these from other initiatives. Successful implementation of these strategic initiatives can heavily impact execution results. Ensure you address the company’s vision in your program to continue to grow your company and benefit stakeholders.

Types of Strategic Initiatives

Regardless of the kind of industry you work in, you’ll want to explore the various types of strategic initiatives to find what works for you. Here are several examples for you to keep in mind:

Corporate level: This level concerns the markets your organization competes in. For example, a software company may want to expand its products into phone manufacturing or try to develop new hardware for its initiative.

Business level: This initiative tells you how to succeed over competitors, such as restaurant chains working to improve their existing menus.

Functional level: Initiatives at the level of single departments or teams help your organization improve its internal processes and contribute better programs. For example, restaurants may want to develop a marketing team that leverages taste test results for their customers.

Defensive initiatives: Maintain what currently works for your company while defending against competitors. A cable network may use this initiative by developing its own streaming service to stay relevant in the public eye.

Why You Should Have Strategic Initiatives

So, why should your company or organization have strategic initiatives in place? In short, strategic initiatives help your business achieve specific goals while closing the gap between your target and how your company currently performs. Initiatives benefit top leadership teams and individuals, such as executives and CEOs, who need to build a strong foundation to review their many projects.

Initiatives help organizations concretely define how certain issues impact their programs while focusing on achievable goals that will bring strong changes to the company or community. Strategic initiatives help improve your overall operations while reducing complacency among your team members. You’ll find the greatest returns on your projects when everyone knows how organized the strategy is.

The Three Most Common Reasons Why Strategic Initiatives Fail

A strategic initiative may fail for several different reasons. If your strategy isn’t going to plan, look for some tell-tale signs that it wasn’t ready for execution yet. Here are the three most common reasons strategic initiatives may falter.

1. Lack of Alignment

One of the most critical issues to address within your organization is a lack of alignment. Misalignment may happen when your initiatives do not express your priorities, contrast your initial values or fail to address pressing issues. Whether or not the mission is successful does not matter if your initiatives are misaligned, causing tension within the organization or preventing your business from presenting a unified vision. These outcomes are not desirable, and your company should strive to prioritize the programs that align with your values and mission statement.

2. Lack of Focus

In some cases, your business may lack focus. This can look like prioritizing too many goals, creating stress on your resources or failing to support your staff members. Focus helps your company minimize the number of projects, allocate the correct resources and hire enough people to support your strategy. Even if your resources are limited, you can focus on projects that are most meaningful and achievable.

3. Lack of Discipline

Discipline is essential while executing your initiative. However, many companies find that when new opportunities come, they take resources away from other projects to focus on their new ideas. As such, nothing ever succeeds. Try to question new opportunities instead, asking yourself whether it is relevant to your strategy. If yes, pursue the project that will add value to your company, and if no, reject the new opportunity and focus on your current strategy. Discipline helps you stay competitive in your current industry no matter what comes your way.

How to Develop a Strategic Initiative

So, you’ve identified the need for strategic initiatives. Now it is critical to develop them effectively. But what steps does this entail?

Step 1: Define the Strategic Initiative

One of the first steps is to define the initiative, clearly articulating the choices you will make.

According to Freek Vermeulen and the Harvard Business Review, many companies fail to implement proper strategies . An actual strategy sets clear decisions for the team and defines what your company plans to do and what may not work for its goals.

Many strategies are shelved despite how hard your team works on the plan. In most cases, this is due to unclear choices or a failure to define the initiative.

One of the best ways to define your strategic initiatives is to review your projects and gaps in performance consistently. An initiative often includes several strategic goals that a team can use to focus on its mission and values. When you focus on a few specific goals, you may better understand your strategy and how your ideas can improve the community or your business.

Define your initiative by setting measurable, specific, realistic objectives for your company. This may help inform your overall definition by understanding your plans to achieve your goals and the point of each strategy you focus on.

Step 2: Determine the Strategic Initiative’s Scope

The next step is to define the scope. This consists of the necessary resources required to bring the plan to life. These resources should include financial, human capital and technological resources.

When defining the scope, don’t forget what could go wrong. Identify key insights and risks that could compromise the successful execution of the strategy. With the stakes understood, identify the appropriate mitigations for the identified risks.

Examples of Strategic Initiatives From 3 Different Industries

Organizations in various industries may use strategic initiatives to help grow their business or execute helpful plans. From local government agencies to nonprofit companies and large chain businesses, different industries can use an organized and detailed outline of their goals to find strategic plans that best fit their needs. Here are three strategic initiative examples from the healthcare, nonprofit and banking industries.

Healthcare: Healthcare organizations like hospitals may look to increase their market share. This may look like trying to reach new patients or customers or appeal to the local population with new marketing tactics or community services.

Healthcare organizations like hospitals may look to increase their market share. This may look like trying to reach new patients or customers or appeal to the local population with new marketing tactics or community services. Nonprofits: Nonprofit industries rely on donations from the community or investors to grow their businesses and help the community. An example of a nonprofit industry initiative may look like a plan to create a performance culture. This objective can help a nonprofit improve its internal culture while focusing more on incentives or personal management.

Nonprofit industries rely on donations from the community or investors to grow their businesses and help the community. An example of a nonprofit industry initiative may look like a plan to create a performance culture. This objective can help a nonprofit improve its internal culture while focusing more on incentives or personal management. Banks and credit unions: Banks or credit unions may want to focus on initiatives like cross-selling or improved productivity across teams. When selling more products, a company may want to create a strategic plan to sell various products to its current customer base to increase revenue. If a bank seeks to improve productivity, it might consider an initiative that helps organize products or companies across multiple lines of business.

How to Execute a Strategic Initiative

With the initiatives clearly defined and scoped, it’s time to develop the plan to execute your strategic initiative.

Most organizations have their own process for building a plan for strategic initiatives. Unfortunately, not all these ways position you for success. As you develop your project, keep the following tips in mind to help you generate results.

Create Alignment

Ensure that there is alignment for each item within your plan. Point out which areas of focus, goals, and outcomes are impacted by different bodies of work within the plan. If you’re unsure where to start, ask yourself , “How?” and “Why?”. Understand how strategic initiatives directly tie to organizational goals and key performance indicators (KPIs).

Alignment starts when employees understand their roles and how they affect the overall strategy. A successful strategy begins and ends with a company and employees committed to their vision and performing achievable goals.

Identify Supporting Activities and Milestones

Most of the strategic initiatives won’t be completed on their own. Identify supporting activities and milestones that will increase your likelihood of generating your desired results. Ensure that the supporting activities and milestones are appropriately resourced. Failure in these will impact the success of the overarching strategic initiative.

One of the best ways to identify activities and milestones is by communicating clearly with all employees. Create a culture that celebrates milestones and strives to reach your strategic goals through incentives, well-organized schedules, and tasks.

Drive Towards Measurable Outcomes

Plans often consist of a lot of qualitative information. This could be a color rating/scale or simple context on initiative completion.

However, initiatives and activities must drive toward measurable, quantifiable outcomes . With proper metrics, there is no question about what success ultimately looks like. This impacts completion and improves insight into how the initiative is progressing.

Perhaps your company may be striving toward customer retention. In that case, you’ll want to train your managers to monitor your goal’s progress and drive your workers toward excellence. Whatever you want to improve within your company, you’ll want to track measurable outcomes through numerical goals and KPIs.

Establish Clear Start and Due Dates

Clarity around expectations is one of the best things you can establish in your planning process. Simply defining clear start and due dates is an easy place to start.

Ensure that you and your team often communicate about your goals through process maps or time-tracking tools online. The organization is key to creating a focused work environment that prioritizes tasks and completes each one promptly.

Define Accountabilities

Select one person responsible for providing progress updates for each item within your plan.

For many initiatives, there is a great deal of shared accountability and many people working towards completing one body of work. However, there should only be one person responsible for reporting on progress. This eliminates confusion about who to go to for status updates and reinforces accountability.

But don’t stop by assigning it out. Develop a standard cadence of accountability. This cadence defines how often your organization will be requesting and reporting results. This will enable a standardized, quick way to understand how strategic initiatives progress.

Encourage accountability in the workplace with strategy evaluations and performance metrics. Consistent reviews of your work ensure your team stays on track and works to improve any strategies that need to be changed. Feedback from others is also one of the best ways to gather insight into how well your tasks, process, and workflows are working.

704,How to Develop a Product Launch Strategy (+ Examples),https://www.growthcollective.com/blog/product-launch-strategy,4 июн. 2024 г.,"Quick links:

The right product launch strategy could be the key to the success or failure of your new product or solution.Â

According toÂ Harvard Business, about 30,000 new products are introduced every year, and around 95% of those products fail. The problem isnât necessarily with the product or solution itself or with theÂ marketingÂ that comes after, but with the absence of a proper plan to begin with.Â

Without a good product launch strategy, you miss many of the crucial stages involved in preparing your solution for success, from researching your competitors to building marketing plans.Â

Today, weâre going to explore the most important steps you should take when planning your product launch to ensure your revenue soars into the stratosphere.

Why You Need a Product Launch Strategy

Failing to plan often means planning to fail. Just as itâs difficult to boost the ROI on your marketing efforts without aÂ solid planÂ for how youâre going to use each channel, itâs also difficult to prime a product for success without plenty of prior research.Â

According to Gartner, some of the most common reasons products fail include failing to meet customer needs, lack of differentiating factors, and bad timing decisions. Many of these problems could be rectified just with the use of a good product launch strategy.

In todayâs competitive market, releasing a new product without the right strategy could mean youâre setting yourself up for disaster. You may end up releasing your product at the same time as a competitor with a much bigger marketing budget. Or you might focus all of your marketing communications on the wrong information.Â

Whatâs more, itâs worth remembering that launching a product is a complex process. There are multiple stages involved, from getting your product ready to launch to connecting with shareholders and even launching advertising campaigns.Â

Overlook just one crucial element on the road to success, and a product that would have otherwise generated millions in revenue could fizzle into nothing.Â

How to Create a Product Launch Strategy: Step-by-Step

So, how do you create a product launch strategy? Thereâs no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Some well-established businesses have their own pre-defined methodologies for how to effectively research each product and bring it to market.Â

Other smaller companies and startups are constantly experimenting with new strategies, like announcing launches onÂ social mediaÂ or working with influencers. While thereâs no limit to what your product launch strategy might involve, there are some steps every business should take.

Here are the most important stages in any product launch.Â

Step 1: Define Clear Launch Goals

Whenever you establish a new business strategy, whether youâre working on a new marketing campaign or an updated approach to customer service, it helps to have goals in mind. While the most obvious thing youâll want to achieve with your product launch is âgrowth and sales,â you may have other specific targets in mind.Â

You might want to demonstrate how your business outshines your competitors by offering a wider selection of products and features than most. You might be interested in capturing the attention of a new market or drawing attention to your values to boost customer loyalty.Â

Whatever your goals are, make sure theyâre specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-based. Establish which KPIs and metrics youâre going to measure to determine whether your launch has been successful, such as âconversion rateâ or âcustomer lifetime value.âÂ

For example, when Airbnb first launched in 2008, its goal wasnât just to attract customers but to shake up the market with a new perspective of what travel could look like. It knew that accomplishing this goal would mean convincing customers to trust a previously unheard-of service.Â

To boost its chances of success, Airbnb decided to use a referral marketing strategy, incentivizing users to refer travelers and hosts. Every timeÂ someone referred a friend, theyâd get $25 for each trip they took or $75 if they rented out their space.Â

â

The strategy was a massive success because it helped to build trust in the brand. Studies showÂ 84% of peopleÂ rely on recommendations from friends and family members. Whatâs more, because both referred customers and referring customers had something to gain from the service, people were excited to share the concept with their friends.Â

Step 2: Conduct Customer Research

Once you have clear goals in mind for your product launch strategy, the next step is learning as much as you can aboutÂ your target audience. An exceptional product launch needs to help your customers resonate instantly with whatever youâre selling. This means you need to understand your customerâs needs, wants, pain points, and behaviors.Â

The easiest way to do this is to dive into your data. Look at your existing information about your customers and what they like and dislike about your brand. Examine market trends and download reports relevant to your industry to get your finger on the pulse of the landscape.

You can also send out surveys, runÂ polls on social media, or create experimental studies to learn more about your audienceâs demographics, psychographics, and behaviors.Â

Another option is to conduct your own proprietary research. For instance, when B2B company Noluma wanted to draw attention to the benefits of light-protected packaging, they ran their own study to learn about the impact sunlight had on substancesÂ like vitamin A.Â

They found that light degraded vitamin A levels in as little as two hours. But when they spoke to their clients, they found businesses wanted evidence their customers actually cared about this fact.Â

To respond to this demand, Noluma conducted more than a dozen focus groups and ran an influencer-supported marketing campaignÂ to collect more information. They found consumers really did care about the need for light-resistant packaging and were able to run a successful product launch campaign for their B2B prospects on LinkedIn as a result.Â

They captured information from thousands of decision-makers, closed several major deals, and secured huge commitments for millions of light-protected milk packages.Â

Step 3: Assess the Competition

Knowing what your competition is doing is almost as important as understanding your customers. Without the rightÂ competitor insights, you could end up launching a product that canât survive alongside the existing solutions on the market.Â

Start with a SWOT analysis, listing all of your productâs strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. By using an editable SWOT template, you can easily adapt it to your business or product. This will give you an insight into your indirect and direct competitors. Once youâve found your potential competitors, gather as much information as you can about them.

Research their websites, social media strategies, and product successes and failures. Find out what features their products offer, how they create marketing communications, and what lead-capturing techniques are being used. The more you examine your competitors, the easier it will be to find ways you can set yourself apart from the crowd.Â

For instance, Yac, aÂ voice messaging app for teams, looked at competitors like Zoom and Slack and found customers were wasting a lot of time in meetings they didnât need to attend. They used this insight to create their marketing message, which revolved around encouraging customers to âtake their time backâ from other apps.Â

â

The landing page created by the company for its product launch also went on to address exactly how their solution would help employees. Plus, it drew attention to a range of reviews and testimonials from successful companies, showcasing its value.Â



Step 4: Define Your Positioning

Now you have a clear view of what your competitors are doing and what your customers want, the next step is figuring out how youâre going to position your product in the market. Based on your research, you should have a good idea of whether yourÂ marketing strategyÂ should focus on drawing attention to a specific feature, benefit, or your productâs price.

Determine exactly how you want consumers to perceive your product and what specific problem you want to show them youâre solving. Think about how you can use your value proposition to generate buzz and excitement that sets you apart from your competitors.Â

For instance, when everyday consumers were getting interested in the concept of micro-investing, new apps were starting to appear rapidly on the market. RobinHood wanted to position its solution as one of the most sought-after new investing apps on the market.

â

To do this, it created an air of exclusivity with a product launch campaign that required customers to sign up for a waiting list to get access. The fact that consumers had to wait to access the app made it seem far more exciting.Â

What made the product launch strategy even more effective was that RobinHood allowed customers to potentially move up the list by referring friends and family members. This allowed the brand to activate its customers into doing most of its marketing for it. The campaign worked so well that the app had more than 1 million subscribers on launch day.Â

Step 5: Create an Internal Product Launch Communication Plan

This is a crucial step in any product launch strategy, but itâs something many businesses often overlook. Itâs easy to get so caught up focusing on your product launch communication plan for customers that you forget about internal communication.Â

However, failure to have a strong internal communication plan means you risk misaligned teams and an inconsistent marketing strategy. You need to ensure everyone in your business is aware of your timeline for launch, your goals, and the strategic efforts youâre going to use.Â

Getting everyone on the same page with a roadmap template or timeline will reduce the risk of unpredictable âleaksâ that drive attention away from your brand. Plus, it can ensure all of your employees are working together toÂ optimize conversion rates.Â

A good internal communication plan provides your teams with guidance on how youâre going to manage every step of the product launch, from the start through to post-launch. For instance, the Social proofÂ platform YotpoÂ found after customers installed its software, they didnât know what to do next. You should also consider integrating change management software into your post-launch strategy to streamline adaptation processes and mitigate resistance to change within your organization.

The Director of GrowthÂ said users were completing the installation and then getting lost in the next step. The Yotpo team decided the solution was to create an onboarding process that would teach consumers how to use the key features of the platform.Â

The company also created customer emails triggered by customer actions in the onboarding process, aligning their marketing and service teams. This collaborative approach, powered by good research and internal communication, led to a 70% increase in customers using the onboarding service. User retention grew by 50%, and unique users increased by 42%, too.Â

Step 6: Build Your Marketing Plan

The next step in building your product launch strategy, once you have your team aligned, is figuring out how youâre going to promote your new product. Creating a strong marketing plan can take almost as much time as the entire product launch strategy.Â

Youâll need to define which channels youâre going to use to capture customer attention, such as email orÂ social media advertising. Youâll have to reach out to influencers and publications you might want to work with on press releases. Plus, youâll need to establish a clear marketing budget and a consistent messaging strategy to use with your audience.Â

The right marketing plan should always be:

Use consistent messaging:Â Identify your brand tone of voice and personality in advance. Make sure you know which benefits and features youâre going to be drawing attention to, and speak your customerâs language. Create editorial guidelines if necessary.

Identify your brand tone of voice and personality in advance. Make sure you know which benefits and features youâre going to be drawing attention to, and speak your customerâs language. Create editorial guidelines if necessary. Leverage the right timing: Â The earlier you start building hype for your new product, the more interest youâll be able to generate before the launch date. However, make sure that youâre promoting your campaigns at the right time to avoid losing customer interest.Â

Â The earlier you start building hype for your new product, the more interest youâll be able to generate before the launch date. However, make sure that youâre promoting your campaigns at the right time to avoid losing customer interest.Â Access the right channels:Â Find out where your customers are and connect with them through the channels they use. Consider a multi-channel marketing campaign that leverages SEO content, paid advertising, earned media, social media, and more.Â

Apple, for instance, manages to generate significant amounts of attention for its product launches with very little marketing investment. Preparing for product launches, Apple creates social media campaigns, videos, live events, and email marketing strategies tailored to their audience.

They donât tell you much about the technical details or features of their products, but they will tell you how the product is going to improve your life. For instance, when launching the Airbuds,Â Apple drew attentionÂ to their convenience, long battery life, and comfort.Â

â

The company is extremely cautious about how much information it reveals prior to launch, as this prompts both customers and the media to speculate about upcoming features. You may have noticed the company taking a similar approach with its new âVision Proâ headset. Itâs advertised to be life-changing, but we still donât know much about it.Â

As a result, countless tech companies have released their own predictions, increasing the hype and word-of-mouth marketing excitement in the industry.Â

Step 7: Hold a Product Launch Event

Finally, itâs time to plan the event or the big day when youâre going to officially launch your new product. Hosting a dedicated product launch event is one of the best ways to attract engagement from an audience and leverage earned media from news publications.Â

Youâll need to start planning your event several months in advance. This means planning marketing materials, securing a location for the event, and reaching out to any influencers or sponsors you might want to work with. Depending on your budget, you might consider holding a virtual event rather than a physical event to save on costs.Â

Virtual events have grownÂ increasingly popularÂ in recent years, as they allow virtually anyone to attend. Plus, with virtual event hosting platforms, you can capture a lot of useful insights into how many people actually engage with your announcement.Â

The best event should get people talking about your product straight away, answer any questions your previous marketing materials have ignored, and start boosting sales. You can even host regular events once a year to get people excited about upcoming releases.Â

As an example,Â Microsoft holds its Inspire conferenceÂ once a year to share insights into its latest products, developments, and achievements. Not only does the event give Microsoft an incredible opportunity to introduce all of its new creations, but it also leads to the production of tons of valuable content.Â

The company shares videos of its speeches and sessions online for people to check out and follows up with press releases and blog posts. This ensures that people are left talking about all of the latest releases in the companyâs library for weeks after the event ends.

Master Your Product Launch Strategy

Creating a successful product launch strategy can be a challenging process. There are a lot of things to consider, from your competitor and customer research to how youâll manage marketing. However, investing in the right strategy can pay huge dividends for your business.Â

With a comprehensive plan in place, youâll be able to reduce your chances of a âfailure to launchâ significantly. Youâll gather the insights you need to get customers excited about your new products. Youâll know how to outshine your competition, and youâll boost your chances of getting a positive ROI from your marketing campaigns.

186,How to Do Office Space Planning for the Hybrid Workplace,https://www.tribeloo.com/blog-post/how-to-do-office-space-planning-for-your-hybrid-workplace,,"The essence of a future-ready workplace is the ability to be agile and adapt to the changing needs of the workforce. That agility doesn't just limit itself to the work that gets done but also extends to the physical space in which it gets done. That means agile workspace design is equally important as the policies surrounding how your team works.

With that comes the role of office space planningâthe process of designing and configuring an office space to best suit the needs of the people who will be using it. In the context of a hybrid workplace (a mix of remote and in-office work), that means creating a space that's conducive to both types of work to enable productivity, collaboration, and creativity, no matter where employees are working from.

If you're pursuing an office space planning project for your hybrid workplace, here's what you need to keep in mind.

5 Tips for Optimal Office Space Planning

From assessing your current space to understanding the different types of work your employees do, here are a few tips to help you get started on your office space planning journey.

1. Analyze and Assess Your Current Space Based on DataÂ

For starters, you need to take a step back and analyze how your current space is being used. This will give you valuable insights that can help inform your decisions as you move forward with your office space planning project.

There are a few ways to go about this. One is to conduct surveys or interviews with employees to get their feedback on the current space. Or, you could seek the expertise of a workplace consultant who can conduct an in-depth analysis of your space and how it's being used.

â

Another option is to use occupancy sensors or other workspace occupancy tools, like Tribeloo, that give you insights into how the space is being utilized. This data can help you understand which areas are being used the most (or the least), what types of activities are taking place in each area, and more.

For instance, if you find that meeting rooms are always full but very few people are working in the open office area, that could indicate that employees are using the meeting rooms for informal discussions. In that case, you might consider adding more informal settings or booths in the office for ad-hoc or impromptu discussions.

2. Ask for Employee Input

The next thing you need to do is gather input from employees on what they need and want from their workspace. After all, they're the ones who are going to be using the space on a daily basis, so it's essential to get their insights and perspectives.

Their input can be valuable in many ways, from helping you understand which areas need to be improved to what type of furniture or equipment would make their work easier, depending on their role. For instance, if you have employees who are frequently on calls, they might appreciate having dedicated spaces where they can take calls without being disturbed.

â

While you're at it, also make sure to touch on the sensory experience of the space. For example, ask employees about the office's lighting, temperature, and noise levels. All of these factors can impact employee productivity and well-being, so it's important to take them into account when planning your agile workspace.

3. Identify and Document Your Needs

As you gather different input types from employees and other data sources, start to document your findings to avoid getting overwhelmed. This will also help you identify any patterns or trends that emerge from the data. Questions you should ask yourself during this process include:

What do we want to achieve with this space? (e.g., provide an agile workplace environment)

Which departments will work closely together? (to determine adjacencies)

Do certain job roles require designated workstations? (e.g., customer service representatives who need to be near a phone)

How many people do we expect in the office on a daily basis? (to understand demand)

What is our growth trajectory? (to anticipate future needs)

â

â

The answers will give you a better understanding of what type of space you need and how to best utilize it. Ideally, the desired outcome is a well-designed, functional space that meets the needs of your employees and helps them be more productive. To achieve that, the design will usually consist of a mix of:

Open office floor : For collaboration and flexibility

: For collaboration and flexibility Hot desking : For variety and choice

: For variety and choice Activity-based workplaces : For focus and concentration

: For focus and concentration Dedicated desk s: For stability and personalization

s: For stability and personalization Desk neighborhoods : For team cohesion

: For team cohesion Quiet spaces : For breaks and refuge

: For breaks and refuge Phone booths : For privacy and uninterrupted calls

: For privacy and uninterrupted calls Breakout rooms : For informal meetings

: For concentrated work Meeting rooms: For scheduled gatherings

By providing a variety of different spaces, you can accommodate the many activities that take place in an office daily. And by allowing employees to choose where they work, you can create a more agile workplace that supports their individual needs and preferences.

4. Use the Right Tools

The best office space plans are well-informed and carefully thought out. To get to that point, you need the right tools to help you gather data, generate insights, and identify potential solutions. Not just that, but they even help with the implementation process by making it easier to communicate your plans and track progress.

5. Implement, Monitor, and Iterate

Office space planning is an ongoing process that should be revisited regularly. As your company grows and evolves, so will your needs. That's why it's important to have a flexible plan in place that can be easily adapted as required.

Once you've finalized your design, the next step is to implement it. This usually involves some construction and furniture rearranging, so it's important to communicate the changes to your employees in advance. You should also provide them with a map of the new layout so they know where everything is and can find their way around easily.

â

Ideally, you could consider bringing an office design and build company onboard to help with the heavy lifting. Not only will they be able to handle all the construction and furniture arrangements, but they can also advise you on how best to utilize your space.

Once the new space is up and running, it's time to monitor it closely. See how employees use the different areas and get feedback on what's working well and what could be improved. You can also use space utilization data to generate insights and identify any areas that are under- or overutilized.

From there, it's a matter of continuously iterating and making improvements where necessary (A/B testing). By constantly monitoring your space and employee feedback, you can ensure that your office is always optimized for maximum productivity.

In Conclusion

With the right planning and execution, office space planning can be a breezeâeven for hybrid workplaces. From there, the results speak for themselves: a more productive workforce, better utilization of space, and happier employees. So what are you waiting for?

223,How to Find the Right Office Space for Lease in Melbourne,https://unitedco.com.au/how-to-find-the-right-melbourne-office-space-to-lease/,,"When it comes to Melbourne office spaces, finding the right space requires careful consideration of various factors that meet your specific needs and preferences. Melbourne, as a vibrant business hub, offers a wide range of office spaces, each with its unique features and amenities. Whether you’re a startup looking for a creative coworking space or a growing company in need of a professional setting, understanding your requirements is key to finding the perfect office space in Melbourne.

Factors to Consider When Finding the Right Office Space for Lease in Melbourne

1. Office Needs and Requirements

Before beginning your search for office space for lease in Melbourne, it’s essential to thoroughly assess your needs and requirements. Consider the location carefully, as it can impact your business’s accessibility and image. Determine the size of the space you need, taking into account your current team size and potential growth. Think about the layout that would best suit your operations, whether an open-plan design for collaboration or separate offices for privacy.

2. Budget to Lease an Office Space in Melbourne

Setting a budget can help determine how much you can afford to spend on office space, taking into account not only the base rent but also additional costs such as utilities, maintenance fees, taxes, and any other associated costs. Research available options by utilizing online resources, real estate websites, and commercial property listing platforms to search the available office space for lease in Melbourne.

3. Accessibility and Transportation

Consider factors such as proximity to transportation, amenities, and the local business environment before deciding on an office space for lease in Melbourne. Once you have shortlisted potential office spaces, schedule visits to physically inspect them. Assess factors such as layout, size, natural light, ventilation, and overall condition of the space. Consider whether it meets your requirements and if it is conducive to your business operations.

4. Lease Terms

Carefully review the lease terms and negotiate with the landlord or property manager if needed. Understand the terms related to rent, term duration, security deposit, maintenance responsibilities, and any additional fees or clauses. If you are uncomfortable reviewing the terms of the agreement, consider engaging a commercial real estate agent or a lawyer specializing in commercial leases to help you understand the legal aspects of the lease agreement and ensure that your interests are protected.

5. Consider Other Options

It is advantageous to opt for shared workspaces that offer a coworking community alongside office offerings. This is beneficial for business in terms of collaboration, growth, and overall productivity. Consider all the information gathered, including location, amenities, costs, and lease terms, to make an informed decision on the office space that best meets your needs and budget.

Remember to take your time, thoroughly research your options, and carefully review agreements before making a decision. It’s also advisable to consider flexible terms and visit the office space in person to get a feel for the environment and ensure it aligns with your requirements.

What is a comfortable Office Space size?

The size of a comfortable office in a shared workspace can vary depending on several factors, including the type of business, the number of employees, the nature of work being done, and personal preferences. However, as a general guideline, the following ranges can be considered for different types of office spaces:

1. Private Office Space in a Shared Workspace

A private office typically provides a dedicated space ranging from one person to a team of people. Private offices can provide a higher level of privacy compared to open-plan workspaces. Team members can have confidential discussions, make phone calls, and handle sensitive tasks without concerns about compromising privacy or confidentiality.

The size of private office space in a shared workspace depends on the specific shared workspace provider and the plan or package selected by the business or individual.

In a shared workspace, private office spaces are typically designed to accommodate teams or individuals. The size of private office space in a shared workspace may range from around 50 square feet for a single-person office to 300-400 square feet for a larger team, depending on the requirements of the company.

Some shared workspace providers may offer flexible options for businesses to scale up or down the size of their private office space as their needs change. This can be particularly beneficial for businesses that may experience fluctuating demand or growth.

Private offices can be customized to meet the specific needs of a team or individual team members. The layout, furniture, and amenities can be tailored to suit the work requirements, preferences, and comfort of the team, which can enhance overall job satisfaction and productivity. They can also be designed to facilitate collaboration.

Team members can still have opportunities for face-to-face interactions and brainstorming sessions in a dedicated space without the distractions of an open-plan layout. Private offices can create a sense of team cohesion and identity, as team members work nearby and share a physical space. It can foster a sense of camaraderie and team spirit, which can positively impact team dynamics and collaboration.

2. Open-plan Office

An open-plan office is a shared workspace without individual offices, typically used for collaborative work. The absence of physical barriers in an open-plan office can promote spontaneous interactions, discussions, and collaborations among team members. It can foster a sense of community and encourage teamwork across departments, as team members can easily communicate and collaborate, leading to increased knowledge sharing and creativity.

The size of an open-plan office space in a shared workspace will depend on the specific shared workspace provider and the plan or package selected by the business or individual. These types of office spaces are typically designed to accommodate larger teams or businesses that require more collaborative workspaces. The size of open-plan office space in a shared workspace may range from a few hundred square feet to several thousand square feet, depending on the provider and the specific layout and configuration of the workspace.

Open-plan offices can be more flexible in terms of layout and space utilization, allowing for easy reconfiguration and adaptation to changing team needs. It can be easier to rearrange workstations, seating arrangements, and collaborative spaces to accommodate different work styles or team dynamics, providing versatility in the use of space.

Open-plan offices can often be more cost-effective compared to private offices, as they require less square footage per person, resulting in potentially lower real estate costs. Open-plan layouts can also be more efficient in terms of space utilization, as they minimize enclosed spaces and maximize the use of shared common areas.

Open-plan offices can promote a sense of equality among team members, as everyone is working in the same shared space without any hierarchy in terms of office size or location. This creates a transparent and inclusive work culture where team members are connected and engaged.

Additionally, open-plan offices, in particular, can support agile or collaborative work practices, such as project-based teams or cross-functional teams, where team members need to work closely together and share information frequently. It can facilitate quick and easy communication and collaboration, which can be beneficial for fast-paced, dynamic work environments.

Access a range of different work environments with a Shared Workspace

Co-working spaces or shared workspaces provide shared office facilities for multiple individuals or companies. Shared workspaces are ideal for businesses that need to scale up or down quickly. As your business grows, you can easily rent additional office space or upgrade to a larger office within the same shared workspace, without the hassle of moving to a new location. This provides you with the flexibility to adapt to changing business needs without being locked into a long-term lease or the overhead costs of maintaining a larger office space.

Working in a shared workspace can provide a sense of community and reduce the isolation that some remote workers or small business owners may experience. It can offer opportunities for social interaction, collaboration, and learning from others. This type of workspace can be a good office size due to its cost-effectiveness, flexibility, networking opportunities, amenities, community, and scalability, making it an attractive option for many individuals and businesses seeking a flexible and collaborative work environment.

It’s important to consider not only the size of the office space but also the layout, functionality, and flexibility of the space to ensure comfort and productivity.

Additionally, factors such as common areas, meeting rooms, storage space, and amenities like kitchenettes and restrooms should also be taken into account when determining the appropriate size for an office space. It’s recommended to thoroughly assess your business needs, work requirements, and future growth plans when determining the comfortable size for an office space.

How much space does each person need in a shared workspace?

In general, a good rule of thumb is to provide each person with at least 70 to 100 square feet of space in a shared workspace. This should allow for a comfortable and productive working environment, while also providing enough room for necessary equipment and furniture.

Furthermore, different types of work may require different amounts of space. For example, employees who spend most of their time on the computer may require less space than those who need room for physical materials or equipment. The amount of space needed per person in an office can vary depending on various factors, including the nature of the work, the type of office layout required, and individual preferences.

However, as a general guideline, the following ranges can be considered.

1. Nature of work: The type of work being performed can greatly impact the space needed per person. For example, employees who primarily work on computers may require less physical space compared to those who need to perform tasks that require more physical movement or equipment. Jobs that require frequent collaboration, meetings, or team discussions may also require more space for group interactions.

It can be beneficial to consider coworking spaces for the most diverse options for working when it comes to choosing office space. For example, design directors may need a private office space to close the door and take phone calls, but may also need the flexibility of other inspiring spaces to create some drawings. They may also need to think of a fresh break-out space for weekly tasks like team briefings or brainstorming sessions.

2. Office layout: The layout and design of the office can also affect the space needed per person. Open-plan layouts, where workstations are close together without dividing walls, tend to require less space per person compared to enclosed offices or cubicles.

However, individual preferences and job requirements should also be considered. Some employees may prefer more privacy and space, while others may thrive in a more collaborative and open environment.

3. Technology requirements: The technology needs of employees can also impact the space required. For example, employees who need multiple monitors, specialized equipment, or storage for physical documents may require more space compared to those with minimal technology requirements.

Consideration should also be given to the placement of power outlets, network connections, and other technology infrastructure. For example, a marketing company in a shared workspace may find they video conference quite a lot and may benefit from choosing office space in a shared workspace, as they often have an array of meeting rooms that can be booked online.

4. Storage needs: The need for storage can vary depending on the nature of work and the office setup. Employees who require physical storage for files, documents, or equipment may require additional space for cabinets, shelves, or lockers.

Adequate storage should be factored into the overall office space requirements. Other storage facility access should be considered when deciding on office space like bicycle storage or end-of-trip facilities. These wellness amenities support healthy habits both in and out of the office.

5. Individual preferences: Individual preferences of employees should also be taken into account. Some employees may prefer more personal space and privacy, while others may be comfortable with shared workstations or smaller work areas.

Considering the preferences and comfort of employees can help create a productive and satisfied workforce. To ensure inclusiveness, office space should be designed to ensure comfort, efficiency, and wellbeing of its members, and for guests who may use a wheelchair or have a disability.

6. Future growth and flexibility: It’s important to consider future growth and flexibility when determining office space requirements. If the business is expected to grow soon, it’s prudent to plan for additional space per person to accommodate the expansion.

Flexibility in office layout and design can also allow for changes in the future without disrupting operations. It also may be advantageous to consider spaces that welcome registered assistance dogs, etc.

It is vital to assess the specific needs of your organization and consider various factors to determine the optimal Melbourne office spaces suitable for your unique requirements. Consulting with a professional interior designer or space planner can also be beneficial in making informed decisions about office space requirements.

475,How to Generate More Revenue With Customer Expansion ...,https://userpilot.com/blog/how-to-generate-revenue-with-customer-expansion-strategies/,,"What if you could boost revenue without having to invest a small fortune in acquiring new users? Making the most out of your existing users while simultaneously improving satisfaction ratings are the core values that lie at the heart of customer expansion strategies.

Read on to learn about cross-selling, upselling, and other top tactics that can help you maximize the value received on both ends of the SaaS relationship!

TL;DR

Customer expansion creates more value for existing customers and brings in more revenue as a result.

Customer expansion strategies can include elements of upselling, promoting add-ons, or advertising rarely-used features.

Upselling and cross-selling both boost CLV but through different means.

Marketing your add-ons is essential as they aren’t capable of generating standalone revenue.

Upselling too soon will likely be unsuccessful and could leave a bad taste in the mouths of new users.

Remarketing is cheaper than customer acquisition and existing users are far more likely to buy in comparison to new prospects.

Showcasing features at the appropriate time can speed up growth on your SaaS platform.

Tools like Userpilot can make your customer expansion strategy more agile due to zero-code capabilities and advanced user segmentation.

What is customer expansion?

Customer expansion is the practice of creating more value for customers and, as a result generating extra revenue from the users you already have. In addition to being one of the most cost-effective marketing methods, it’s also mutually beneficial to both the user and your revenue.

What is a customer expansion strategy?

A customer expansion strategy is the playbook you’ll use to achieve the target goals on both ends. This could entail getting users to explore features they rarely use, upselling them to a premium plan, or promoting add-ons.

What are the types of customer expansion in SaaS?

The three main types of customer expansion are:

upselling

cross-selling

add-ons

Each method comes with its own pros and cons so let’s delve deeper into this world of customer expansion.

Customer expansion through upselling

Upselling is a popular sales technique that gets customers to spend more by upgrading to a premium product or service that is of a higher level than what they originally purchased.

In the context of SaaS, this would center around which plan a user is on and whether or not they’re on a free trial.

Customer expansion through cross-selling

Cross-selling differs from upselling as, instead of selling a higher-end variant, you offer a related product or service. These products are often built in a standalone format but are suitable for personas that match your existing users.

Atlassian interface emphasizes cross-selling.

Customer expansion through add-ons

Add-ons differ from cross-sells in that they only work if the user already has the base product. Seeing as they don’t function as standalone products, it’s essential that you market them effectively so users adopt these add-ons.

Zoom add-ons.

Upselling and cross-selling tips for customer expansion

While upselling may not be an exact science, there are best practices that can significantly improve your results if you apply them to your customer expansion strategy.

#1 – Get to know your audience

User personas are the first step to defining your target audience but the process shouldn’t end there. Look at demographic and psychographic data to get a deeper understanding of your user base.

It will be easier to appeal to existing users if you know how they think, where they’re from, and what drives them forward on a daily basis. Ultimately, understanding their goals and challenges will make upselling/cross-selling more intuitive on your end.

#2 – Don’t upsell too soon

Premature upsells can look like a cash grab to users who haven’t fully realized the value of your product. Wait for customers to reach the “AHA moment” of their journey before you ask them to spend more money on plan upgrades or related products.

#3 – Use a “problem compass”

Let the users’ problems guide you like a compass and help you decide which product(s) to upsell/cross-sell as a solution. Looking at these challenges from the perspective of your users will help align the customer expansion strategy with their own journey.

User Journey Map

#4 – Active listening

You never know when an opportunity to upsell will arrive so always be on the ready. Whether it’s a brief phone call or an email exchange, hint at how premium features can help them reach their goals more quickly.

#5 – Retention mindset

If you’re suffering from high user churn rates then upselling/cross-selling may actually be able to help with retention, in addition to revenue growth. Try to first identify why people are leaving through NPS surveys and churn surveys then suggest plans or related products that address these issues.

Why is customer expansion so important in SaaS?

Customer acquisition can be very pricey, especially in the SaaS space. This is part of why generating revenue through customer expansion is so important.

Revenue generated by new customers can be categorized as expensive revenue while revenue you generate from existing customers is called expansion revenue.

Here’s the metric you need to be focusing on: Expansion MRR rate

Expansion Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

In the annual SaaS survey by Matrix Partners and Pacific Crest Securities, it was found that the average cost to generate $1 worth of annual contract value (ACV) is $1.18 when acquiring fresh users.

To generate that same $1 in yearly revenue, only $0.28 would need to be invested in upselling. In essence, you can see an equal boost in revenue for less than a quarter of the cost making your campaigns 4x more profitable.

To look at it from another perspective, it would take more than a year to recover the cost of acquiring new customers whereas you can break even on upsell costs within a single quarter.

Bottom line: it’s easier to sell to existing customers than to acquire new ones. The odds of successfully selling to an existing customer are around 60%-70%.

When you compare that to the 5%-20% success rate of selling to new prospects, it becomes clear that your current userbase is a far more profitable market than whatever lies in uncharted territories.

Customer expansion can also increase the likelihood of renewals by helping users realize value through other features that they may not use often. Considering the fact that renewals are the cheapest form of revenue with a CAC of $0.13, increasing retention in this way is very lucrative.

Finally, it’s crucial that you keep key user retention metrics high so that you have enough existing users for expansion strategies to work. After all, there’s no one to remarket to if all your new users leave too soon.

How to grow your SaaS using customer expansion strategies

You can’t rely on your sales team only or customer success to reach out to users and ask them to upgrade. This could turn out to be completely unproductive, possibly even intrusive, and you will probably end up missing quite a few upselling opportunities.

In SaaS it’s important to communicate contextually, showcasing benefits of an upgrade or add-on at the right time (aka when it’s most relevant for the user). Automation is a major part of customer expansion — especially for SaaS companies.

By leveraging automation and product analytics, you’ll be able to identify the ideal opportunity to display in-app marketing compelling customers to upgrade. Let’s have a look at a few effective customer expansion strategies.

Drive customer expansion by showing users what they’re missing out on

Fear of missing out — or FOMO — is one of the most persuasive mechanisms that can get users to upgrade. Sometimes users just need to see what they’re missing out on to take that leap.

Miro is a great example of teasing users without surrendering full functionality:

Miro convinces users to upgrade to a premium plan by making all boards public by default and promoting private boards as a premium feature.

If you’re using a free account then Miro will let you create up to three boards. However, you’ll be shown a reminder that the boards are public whenever you create a new one. This hints at the fact that upgrading would be beneficial to those who need private boards.

Leverage contextual journey touchpoints automation for customer expansion

When you ask your customers to upgrade is almost as important as how you ask them. Loom is a company that has applied this principle to its in-app messaging. After a video is finished recording, they prompt users to test out a premium feature that removes ums, uhs, and other filler words with a compelling microvideo.

Considering the fact that most recordings will contain a lot of these filler words, Loom has managed to find the perfect moment to promote their tool — exactly when the user hears the filler and wishes it wasn’t there.

At the end of the day, context is everything!

Loom gets users to upgrade to premium plans by letting them test out premium tools when they need them most.

Drive customer expansion by removing upgrade friction

According to the Fogg Behavior Model — which we took a closer look at in our Trial to Paid Conversion Rate article — there are three things a person needs in order for a behavior to occur:

Motivation

Ability

Prompt

All three elements need to converge simultaneously.

This means you could be missing out on upgrades if users have moments where they want to take the leap but are met with too much friction. Intercom has managed to get around this friction by making the upgrade button readily available when the user is most likely to need it.

When their users want to add an element not included in their plan, a tooltip will pop up explaining the value of a premium plan with an “upgrade now” button along with it.

Intercom upgrade prompts explains the value and keeps friction low.

Drive customer expansion with premium feature trials

There are situations where the most straightforward way to showcase the value an upgrade brings is to offer a trial. This gives users a chance to test out a feature before they pay to unlock it.

For instance, Asana never hides features that are reserved for premium accounts. Instead, they use them as a hook to get more freemium users on premium trials and thus see high upgrade rates.

Asana offering premium feature trials.

Configure your plans to drive customer expansion

Tailoring SaaS pricing based on the needs of users is an extremely powerful strategy when trying to drive customer expansion. Miro is once again a great example of this, as it has successfully spread out its features across four plans to optimize customer expansion.

The free plan doesn’t have a member limit for teams because more freemium users means higher upgrade numbers at the end of each month. The paid plans are broken up into three price brackets so that users only have to pay for the features they want.

This makes Miro accessible, affordable, and primed for upward mobility in its user base.

Miro’s tiered pricing system makes its platform accessible to companies of all sizes.

Best tools to use to drive in-app contextual customer expansion

While using custom code to create tooltips and in-app modals is always an option, it comes with the downside of requiring developers. You’ll need them for the initial creation, any messaging revisions, and split testing.

This makes it not only expensive but quite time-consuming.

To keep your in-app messaging more agile and direct, you could use in-app product growth tools to build/test user communication that drives growth through account expansion.

Userpilot lets you take advantage of every opportunity to upsell and prompt plan upgrades within your current userbase. It achieves this by leveraging contextual in-product experiences and displaying different modules based on user behavior.

The advanced segmentation capabilities of Userpilot ensure that you’ll always show the right message to the right user at the right time.

Userpilot lets you utilize its advanced segmentation capabilities to trigger experiences at the ideal moment.

You can create tooltips like Intercom, modals like Asana and Mailchimp, and split-test different approaches to optimize results.

Conclusion

The marketing author Tim Riesterer once criticized companies for only allocating 10%-20% of their sales budgets towards customer expansion when 70%-80% of annual revenue comes from renewals+upsells.

There’s nothing wrong with seeking out new users, but it’s important not to forget about the untapped riches that may be sitting right under our noses. The key takeaway from this article should be the evergreen fact that there’s always more value to be had — on both sides of the SaaS relationship.

598,How to Implement New Work Processes Successfully,https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/how-to-implement-processes,,"Change is inevitable and often necessary, but that doesnât mean itâs easyâespecially for your employees. When processes are updated or reworked, you may face pushback, confusion, and frustration from your team.Â

Even if you've put a lot of work into analyzing and improving your processes, all that work is for naught if people don't adopt and follow the new standards. Thatâs why itâs important to have a plan in place to implement new processes and get employees on board from the start.

How do you implement a business process?

Use the following tips on how to implement a new process and communicate it to employees so everyone follows it the intended way.

1. Explain the need for the change

Clear communication is essential for a smooth transition to new processes at work. As you introduce new processes, explain why the change was necessary, what goals you hope to achieve with these changes, and what benefits these new processes will have for employees.Â

When you explain the why behind a decisionâespecially a process change that significantly impacts employeesâ day-to-day workflowsâemployees are more likely to understand the need for the change and get behind it.

Emphasize the value these changes provide to your organization or team and connect them to your overarching company goals. This needed context can make all the difference in adoption and implementation.Â

2. Get buy-in from leadership and key employees

If you want your team to adopt new processes, those changes should be sponsored by leadership and, when possible, mirrored by one or two key employees. When change is championed and prioritized from the top and reinforced on the ground by management and key employees, your workforce will be more likely to follow.Â

Appoint an influential employee to be your process champion. They will be your on-the-ground example to the rest of your team of what the process can look like and how it can benefit them. Positive peer pressure combined with a strong support system of training and mentorship will help everyone get on board early.

3. Adapt training according to employee needs

Assess your organizationâs current state in terms of its people, processes, and resources. Which employees will be executing the new process, what are their current skills and knowledge, and what tools are available to support this transition?

Once you understand your current process landscape, you can design training that addresses your employeesâ needs and fills gaps in skillsets or knowledge, and you can provide the tools and resources necessary for their success.Â

You can train and upskill your workforce in various ways. Consider including the following strategies as part of your training program:

Implement a tutoring or mentoring program.

Establish peer-to-peer accountability systems.

Develop workshops, presentations, or seminars.Â

For example, if your team is adopting new software to automate part of their workflow, you will need to make sure they have the knowledge and training to navigate the software itself and integrate it into their workflow. They will also need the right technical support to troubleshoot any issues.Â

If they donât have these resources, they are less likely to adopt the new software in the first place and may implement workarounds when issues arise.Â Â Â

4. Visualize your new processesÂ

Ideally, you should have visuals of your updated processes from your planning phase. Use these visuals, such as process maps and flowcharts, to introduce the changes you are making and clarify department, team, and individual roles and accountabilities within the workflow.Â

Visuals are a great way to communicate complex information quickly and effectively and can be a powerful training tool. Documenting your processes also helps prevent miscommunication and acts as an essential reference for managers and employees alike.Â

Lucidchart makes it easy to map your current and future states and organize process documentation, creating a single source of truth. Link data and documents directly to your process map so all the information is accessible in one central location. Tag team members to notify them of specific areas in the process that need attention, and easily share process documentation through your favorite communication channels.Â",preparing to open new office
272,How to Plan a Successful Office Move - MTC Office Removals,https://mtcofficeremovals.com/how-to-plan-a-successful-office-move/,,"Office Moves Made Easy: Essential Planning and Execution Tips

Introduction

When it comes to relocating an office, there’s no one-size-fits-all answer – every business has unique needs and challenges. However, the importance of meticulous planning in facilitating a smooth transition cannot be overstated. Whether you’re an emerging startup or an established company, executing a successful office move is a major milestone that requires strategic preparation.

Pre-Move Preparation

Assessing Current Space Needs

Before even beginning the hunt for a new location, it’s crucial to evaluate your current space and anticipate future needs. Think about what works, what doesn’t, and how your new space can support your company’s growth. Small businesses especially need to consider scalability, aiming for a space that accommodates both current operations and envisaged expansion.

Setting a Budget

Calculating and sticking to a budget is fundamental. Unexpected costs can escalate quickly, so ensure you account for all possible expenses, from professional moving services to the potential loss of productivity during the move.

Creating a Timeline

A realistic timeline will keep everyone on track. Consider key dates such as the end of your current lease and any relevant business cycles. A timeline also facilitates smoother transitions when it involves staff, stakeholders, and other operational necessities.

Logistics and Organisation

Hiring Movers or Organising an In-House Move Team

Evaluate the pros and cons of professional office movers versus a DIY move. For many small businesses, hiring professionals can be a cost-effective decision when factoring in the time and manpower required to self-move.

Packing and Labeling Items

Effective labeling is a game-changer. XYZ Marketing’s effective labeling system streamlined unpacking, minimizing disruption and allowing staff to resume work almost immediately after the move.

Updating Address and Utilities

Don’t overlook the details. Ensure all service providers are updated well in advance to avoid any disruption in services.

Communication and Coordination

Notifying Stakeholders

Transparency is key. Keep clients, suppliers, and business partners in the loop to manage expectations and maintain trust.

Delegating Tasks

Effective delegation not only helps to spread the workload but also empowers team members by involving them in the process. Ensure clear roles and responsibilities to maximize efficiency.

Conducting Walkthroughs

Schedule walkthroughs at both the new and old locations. This way, everyone gets a clear picture of what needs to happen and when, reducing the risk of errors or oversights.

Execution Day

Checklists and Last-Minute Preparations

By the day of the move, everyone should be on the same page with checklists verified and last-minute preparations complete. DEF Solutions’ proactive problem-solving, despite the unexpected delay, is a classic example of why flexibility and a cool head under pressure are invaluable.

Handling Unexpected Challenges

Even with the best-laid plans, surprises can happen. Preparing contingency plans and maintaining a nimble mindset will go a long way.

Post-Move Evaluation

Once the dust settles, take time to evaluate what went well and what could have been better. Post-move insights are precious for future reference.

Pros and Cons of Office Relocation

Key Factor: Planning and Communication

Effective Communication: Keeping lines of communication open with all stakeholders (employees, management, clients, and service providers) throughout the process is crucial. Regular updates and a clear explanation of the benefits and reasons behind the move can help in managing expectations and minimising disruptions.

Conclusion

From the meticulous budgeting and piloting of ABC Tech to the resilient adaptability of DEF Solutions in the face of adversities, these real-life examples highlight the versatility and resourcefulness required during office moves. To ensure a successful office move, it’s essential to follow these outlined steps, tailor them to your specific context, and remember that success hinges on thorough planning and execution.

113,How to Plan an Office Expansion | Project plan by Kisi,https://www.getkisi.com/guides/off-management-checklist-how-to-plan-an-office-expansion,,"What are the signs of the need for an office expansion?

If you are coming to work to a messy office each day, this may be the first sign that you need to create an office expansion project plan. When your employees don’t have enough room to turn their chairs around or when you start to lose important files because you lack shelves to organize them, you should start thinking about how to expand your office. However, office expansion is not only about reorganizing stuffed drawers, finding the surface to place desks, or not having enough spaces in the parking lot. Common indicators that a business is growing are related to having a solid business base, a steady influx of customers and a stable cash flow.

‍A busy office is an unmistakable indicator that you need to expand your business

When these initial signs of office expansion show up, your customers may ask you to introduce a new product or a new service, which is an additional proof that the limits of your current business are too small. For a startup, this change typically happens after the first couple of years - cyclical growth that takes place year by year is a much better indicator of an expanded office than a one-off surge of operations and revenue. Once the office is too tight for your team, staff have already reached a tipping point of coherence and collaboration and they are ready to take on new challenges. Finally, when a new technology gets introduced into your niche, you will need to start thinking about a new office expansion project plan.

What are the main considerations of an office expansion?

Before widening your office space, and even as you search for a building to open a new office, you need to think of how will the office space fit within your plans for growth. If you have a long-term business plan or strategy, things can be easy. But even if you are not that organized, it’s always good to have 15 to 20 percent flexibility to incorporate a possible future office expansion.

Technology is a crucial consideration for office expansion since it provides the tools to save space, improve office design, foster team collaboration, and amp up productivity. Modern offices don’t have as many walls as before, and contain open areas with social and work-related purposes. Such office organization is convenient for expanding an office because it allows for repurposing an area into something else when a need arises. For example, a long corridor can be turned into an extra storage or a conference room can turn into an after-work social place. Since workers are more mobile and most of the work is done online, when you need to complete a modern office expansion, you won’t have to worry about breaking walls, moving bulky furniture, and large paper filing cabinets. Smaller devices, wireless connections, and open spaces have made office expansions simple and easy. Therefore, always give priority to setting up appropriate technology as you plan to grow your office.

‍Technology is a crucial consideration for office expansion

Naturally, money is another important consideration - when you are working on a budget, you can’t spend so much of it that your expanded business bounces back. An advantage can be if you are located in a facility where you can take up more space as you employ more people, but that’s not always the case. However, if you invest a bit more in an office design with shared desks and enough space to put a few more desks when you sign the lease, you won’t need to spend as much when the time for office expansion comes.

It will be a breeze to complete the expansion if you consider your workspace energy efficiency a priority. Think of finding a green building, installing energy efficient lightning, bring in natural light, choose a proper HVAC system, all in all, make your office an energy-saving, healthy and pleasant environment.

An office expansion project plan (e.g. a to-do checklist)

Now you’ve known the signs that indicate an expansion and have included the considerations in your planning process, it’s time to create an office expansion project plan. Here is what your plan should focus on:

Write down the information about the business current facilities and equipment, put your business goals next to it, and think about how to bring both together

Think about your target audience and try to anticipate how its needs will affect the office expansion plan

Study the competition to see what steps you need to take to expand to a competitor’s level.

Write down the daily activities, check how will the office expansion impact the daily activities, and vice versa

Keep your finance and budget plans handy to calculate expansion costs and expected profits in the period when you expand

618,How to Plan and Execute Your Office and Business Relocation,https://www.dawsonmoving.com.au/news/plan-and-execute-your-office-and-business-relocation/,,"If you are the office manager or operations manager for a company currently occupying office space in Melbourne, and you have been instructed to source a new commercial premises, there is no doubt you are feeling excited, apprehensive, probably a little nervous and likely very overwhelmed!

Today we wanted to help alleviate your stress, and help you enjoy the exciting aspect of effectively planning and executing your office and business relocation!

Whether this might be a seasonal task for you, or perhaps it’s your first time organising a big transition for your company and staff, each time you relocate your office, it will be a different experience. In order to ensure you are ticking all of the essential moving boxes, we have compiled a comprehensive guide that you can bookmark and save for each time you move.

Please welcome your new Relocation checklist!

Your first step should be to put together an easily actionable plan for all departments involved, which should include a timeline and the necessary action points for each staff member.

Assemble your team

You’re not likely going to be able to organise everything yourself, especially if you have a medium to large business, so we suggest getting together a trusted team to help you delegate tasks amongst their teams or other departments.

Ensure this team consists of internal team members who understand the intricacies of what will be involved, as well as sourcing external contractors to help you with the move. Hint, now is the time to source your furniture movers should you be enlisting in the help of a reputable company who is experienced in assisting with commercial moves.

Commercial premises management

Once assessing your current lease agreement and signing your new one, you’ll need to liaise with your real estate agent in order to let them know you will be vacating the premises on a specific date with the appropriate amount of notice given for vacating, as well as for organising a final inspection, keys handover as well as any documentation you may have used throughout your lease such as user guides and manuals, warranties on fixtures and anything noteworthy for the next occupiers.

This is also a great time to let your utilities companies and those in need of a forwarding address, such as couriers, know when you will be moving as well as send them your new address. Be sure to let your energy and internet providers know you will be moving, as well as your telecommunications provider, so they can disconnect your existing connections upon your departure and have all your connections established ready for when you settle into your new office.

Human Resource and People & Culture

If you’re unsure who should be involved in the move, your HR team should be your first point of call as they are trained in managing employees, facilitating transitions, and can speak on behalf of yourself and the company regarding the move.

Finance team

Ensure you’re staying within budget by involving payroll and the finance department, who are highly skilled in managing funds allocated for business relocation.

Further, your finance team may ask you to prepare a budget for the move which might include gathering quotes from furniture moving companies of which they can review and manage throughout the moving process.

Tech Team

Ensure you’re leaning on your IT department during this time as they are skilled in handing technology infrastructure throughout your business. Not only are they responsible for connecting all tech-related devices and systems once you have moved, they can also implement and manage a temporary system to ensure your operations systems continue to run throughout the move.

External teams

If your new office will require a design scheme or new fit-out, you’ll need to invest in the assistance of teams such as these and real estate agents to handle all of the paperwork for your lease transfer or set-up of your new lease. If you are searching for office movers, book your desired company as soon as you know your move-in date so they can likely offer you the availability that will work best for you.

Now that you’ve put together a plan of action for all of the above-mentioned steps, you’re next going to want to put together a workflow management plan for all employees to receive as far as possible in advance of the big day.

Once put together, this plan can be communicated via email or through your internal systems and ideally, should come from HR or People & Culture as they can further extend any support needed by employees. Ensure this plan is communicated to all employees involved in the move, as well as contractors and any third parties that may be affected by and should be informed of the move.

This plan should include which departments and team leaders are responsible for which actions and by what dates their responsibilities should be actioned.

Now that you have all the essentials covered in your new office relocation plan which will allow you to execute each aspect efficiently and comfortably, you will no doubt be feeling a little more at ease and ready for the big day!

Here at Dawson Moving & Storage, we have been facilitating office moves and business removals for decades and have close to 100 years of operations under our belt, so you know that when it comes to expert handling of fragile and delicate items and understanding the intricacies of complex systems, your mind can rest easy knowing we only employ the best people for the job.

Keep accurate records of your inventory. Go through each department or area of the office and identify items that are going to be moved and items that are not going to be moved.

This is especially important if you are moving client files and documents as you do not want to misplace any important files during the move. You may want to assign the move team with photocopying important documents and storing copies so they do not get lost in the move.

You should take inventory and know exactly how much stock you have in your company. You should also go through your inventory and your office supplies to identify any items that are no longer used. Mark these unused items with post-its so you know they are not going to be moved to the new location. This will help you get a sense of how much inventory will need to be moved and any inventory that will be disposed of.",planning office relocation
404,How to create a pull request in GitHub,https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github,,"So, you know how to use git. You have a GitHub repo and can push to it. All is well. But how the heck do you contribute to other people's GitHub projects? That is what I wanted to know after I learned git and GitHub. In this article, I will explain how to fork a git repo, make changes, and submit a pull request.

When you want to work on a GitHub project, the first step is to fork a repo.

Use my demo repo to try it out.

Once there, click on the Fork button in the top-right corner. This creates a new copy of my demo repo under your GitHub user account with a URL like:

https://github.com/<YourUserName>/demo

The copy includes all the code, branches, and commits from the original repo.

Next, clone the repo by opening the terminal on your computer and running the command:

git clone https://github.com/<YourUserName>/demo

Once the repo is cloned, you need to do two things:

Create a new branch by issuing the command: git checkout -b new_branch Create a new remote for the upstream repo with the command: git remote add upstream https://github.com/kedark3/demo

In this case, ""upstream repo"" refers to the original repo you created your fork from.

Now you can make changes to the code. The following code creates a new branch, makes an arbitrary change, and pushes it to new_branch:

$ git checkout -b new_branch Switched to a new branch ‘new_branch’ $ echo “some test file” > test $ cat test Some test file $ git status On branch new_branch No commits yet Untracked files: (use ""git add <file>..."" to include in what will be committed) test nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use ""git add"" to track) $ git add test $ git commit -S -m ""Adding a test file to new_branch"" [new_branch (root-commit) 4265ec8] Adding a test file to new_branch 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+) create mode 100644 test $ git push -u origin new_branch Enumerating objects: 3, done. Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done. Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 918 bytes | 918.00 KiB/s, done. Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0) Remote: Create a pull request for ‘new_branch’ on GitHub by visiting: Remote: http://github.com/example/Demo/pull/new/new_branch Remote: * [new branch] new_branch -> new_branch

Once you push the changes to your repo, the Compare & pull request button will appear in GitHub.

opensource.com

Click it and you'll be taken to this screen:

Open a pull request by clicking the Create pull request button. This allows the repo's maintainers to review your contribution. From here, they can merge it if it is good, or they may ask you to make some changes.

TLDR

In summary, if you want to contribute to a project, the simplest way is to:

Find a project you want to contribute to Fork it Clone it to your local system Make a new branch Make your changes Push it back to your repo Click the Compare & pull request button Click Create pull request to open a new pull request

If the reviewers ask for changes, repeat steps 5 and 6 to add more commits to your pull request.

425,How to create branches and merge them using Git,https://www.deployhq.com/git/branching-and-merging,,"If you're working on a new feature, or pushing a bug fix to your site, branching is a great way to ensure you don't cause any issues with your main version.

In this guide we will cover the concepts of branching and merging; using Git as our version control system in the examples covered.

Introduction

In this guide we are going to cover 3 commands - branch , checkout and merge . A branch is essentially a version of your app that can work on, for example a development or bug fix branch. Checkout is the process of switching from one branch to another, so you don't make changes to the wrong version of your site. Finally, merge brings two different branches into one, effectively creating a single version of your site from two different versions.

Let's now look at using these commands in the context of maintaining and improving our site.

Creating a Branch

Our website is live and online, but we would like to add a new feature, let's say a shopping cart so our customers can start buying our product.

We will create a new branch called cart :

$ git checkout -b cart Switched to a new branch 'cart'

This creates a new branch called cart and automatically switches to it, ready to start working on. That command is shorthand for the following:

$ git branch cart $ git checkout cart

So now we have two branches, our main branch, referred to as master , and our newly created cart branch.

Another Branch

We are now working in our cart branch, but let's say we have found a bug on our main site. At this point, we should create a new branch:

$ git checkout -b bugfix Switched to a new branch 'bugfix'

We can work on our fix without disturbing the site, and commit it to our bugfix branch:

$ git commit -m ""fixed the bug"" [ bugfix c42b77e] fixed bug 1 file changed

And now push the branch to our remote repository:

$ git push -u origin buxfix * [ new branch] bugfix -> bugfix Branch bugfix set up to track remote branch bugfix from origin

Merging a Branch

We have tested the fix and we are happy, so let's merge this change into master. But first, we need to switch back to our master branch:

$ git checkout master Switched to branch 'master' Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'

Now we can merge our bugfix:

$ git merge bugfix Updating 68fb3f6..c42b77e Fast-forward index.html | 1 1 file changed

And push to GitHub:

$ git push origin master Total 0 ( delta 0 ) , reused 0 ( delta 0 ) to git@github.com:adamw/first-project/repository.git 68fb3f6..c42b77e master -> master

Housekeeping

Everything looks good, and the bug is now fixed and deployed. Let's remove our bugfix branch:

$ git branch -d bugfix Deleted branch bugfix ( was c42b77e )

We will want to remove the branch from our remote repository as well.

$ git push origin --delete bugfix To git@github.com:adamw/first-project/repository.git - [ deleted] bugfix

Summary

In this guide, we have covered creating, merging, and removing branches, both locally and remotely.",planning to open new branch
673,How to develop a sales strategy for a scale up in tech ...,https://aexus.com/how-to-develop-a-sales-strategy-for-a-scale-up-in-tech-industry/,,"When entering a new market, you will need a sales strategy because the conditions and ways of doing business in the new territory will not necessarily be the same as in your home country. There are several steps to developing a sales outsourcing process for a scale-up in the tech industry. You may even find more often than not that the sales strategy you develop will depend on the company service or product you are offering.

Unique offering

The first thing to look at is trying to find a gap in the market where you have a unique offering. It is important to know what is happening in that specific industry and what are the newest developments. Also, have an in-depth understanding of the market, to find where the pain points are for your potential customers and how your product or service solves that problem. Especially with disruptive technology, as these are usually very specific. Innovations in technology are developed for a reason, and that is to answer a need that is not currently being met. So, looking at the need and the solution may help you to find your place in the market.

You can read more on how to formulate a unique selling proposition here.

Determining the target audience

When you are determining the target audience, you should firstly look at the type of technology. Look at the companies that inspire you in the field. Also, remember that the target is not always set in stone. Once you know the industry and which companies to approach, it is crucial that you are contacting the correct people within the organization. Determine who is using the product and who is the decision-maker in the organization, thus whom you should contact first. Should you first contact the person who is in charge of the budget, before contacting the sponsor who would be the one using the product? Even if the C level is usually in charge of the budget, it’s not always the first point of contact in every situation.

Where to reach your target audience

When targeting potential customers, it is important to try different ways of reaching out to people. Don’t just stick to one channel; use all of them if you can. The channels could include going to meet-ups, going to conventions or trade shows, sending emails, and so on. This will maximize your reach and give you the best chance of finding the right people. It will also show you what works and what doesn’t, allowing you to optimize your conversions and put more resources into the most successful tactic.

Formulating the pitch

When you finally start contacting the potential buyers, the way you introduce the solution will be the most crucial part. Think about how to formulate the pitch for the ideal customers, emphasizing the value of the product to sell the product. Formulating the pitch is a process and you should try different versions and improve accordingly. Also, a good way to approach testing the pitch is to first send it only to a few prospects, based on which you can alter it, rather than “wasting” good leads with the first version. Look at what your competitors are doing and if you can validate your pitch with industry experts this will help enormously. Most industry experts are open to giving feedback and will provide you with reasons for the advice, allowing you to make valuable adjustments.

Set concrete plans and goals, and hone the outreach process

The planning stage is all about forecasting what you’re trying to achieve and then working backward to see how to do it. As an example, a company wants to make 1 million Euros in a year and you calculate that you can do this if you close ten deals. This means you will need to do 30 follow-up meetings from a list of 60 new initial meetings. So, the question becomes how do I get those initial meetings? Well, you need to go back to your pitch and your outreach. Adjust the numbers accordingly when you find it needs adjustment. We all want to get the most out of our sales activities and the process, so good planning and setting goals will help you with time management.

653,Hybrid Office Planning,https://www.fentress.com/hybrid-agile-office-planning,24 мая 2024 г.,"Integrated and Formalized Telework Approach

In the open office, telework was performed at the employee's preference or as needed. Even for government offices with formal telework policies, the space was created with telework more as an accommodation (often a temporary one) than as an integral part of how the office conducts business.

In the hybrid office, the understanding is that telework is here to stay. Many departments have invested in the technology and policies needed to support remote work, and employee and department benefits have been realized. Many government offices are ready for telework to become more permanently woven into the fabric of their day-to-day operations.

Under the hybrid office model, employee schedules are planned to manage both the work and the space to maximize the benefits of the “split time” approach. When employees come into the hybrid office, their time in the office is more purposeful. Employees are there to interact, collaborate, and accomplish tasks better suited to the office environment. In short, the hybrid office is designed to maximize the time employees spend together.

In a hybrid office, there are a variety of options for collaborative meeting spaces and conference rooms – similar to the open office – but with a greater number and variety of videoconferencing facilities and more privacy for the individual workstation. By contrast, employees reserve the time to work from home for tasks that can be done independently or require greater concentration.",new office space planning

143,Indiana AG's Office files lawsuit against Johnson & ...,https://fox59.com/news/indiana-ags-office-files-lawsuit-against-johnson-johnson-for-deceptive-marketing-over-talc-powder/,3 дня назад,"INDIANAPOLIS — Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita has filed a lawsuit against Johnson & Johnson over allegations that the company violated Indiana’s Deceptive Consumer Sales Act.

According to the lawsuit, filed by Rokita’s office on Tuesday in Marion County, the office alleged that Johnson & Johnson “has engaged in unfair or deceptive acts and practices in connection with consumer transactions” related to its Talc Powder products, including “Baby Powder” and “Shower to Shower”.

These products were marketed toward teenage girls and women for daily use on their bodies to maintain a “fresh, dry and clean” feeling to remove friction on the skin and absorb excessive moisture.

The suit accused the drug manufacturing company of failing to disclose to potential clients that carcinogenic asbestos was reportedly detected in some of its Talc Powder products.

“Women who used talc-based powders in the genital area had an increased risk of ovarian cancer compared to those women who do not,” the lawsuit said. “Despite this knowledge, J&J continued marketing of Talc Powder Products as safe, pure, and gentle, and as suitable for use in and on female genitals.”

The complaint went on to claim that Johnson & Johnson had been aware since at least the 1950s that some of its Talc Powder products possibly contained harmful asbestos. The company initially discovered this when learning that its chief source mine for talc in the United States contained tremolite, which is described as one of six separate minerals that “take the form of crystalline fibers known as asbestos,” according to the complaint.

Johnson & Johnson allegedly continued searching for talc deposits in the U.S. market that contained no tremolite but found no “clean” deposits.

“As early as 1969, J&J expressed internal concern in a memo that the tremolite fibers in its talc posed a safety risk, and that J&J would not be able to assure that its powders were safe to use if tremolite in more than ‘unavoidable trace amounts’ were present,” the lawsuit said.

At one point during the 1970s, the lawsuit asserted that Johnson & Johnson met with the FDA and provided “evidence that their talc contains less than 1%, if any, asbestos.”

Johnson & Johnson’s own scientists reportedly conducted studies that demonstrated the company’s talc powder contained asbestos fibers, with a research director warning that Johnson & Johnson should prioritize removing the largest number of tiny fibers in its talc dust that pose a risk of being inhaled.

However, the lawsuit said the director conceded that “no final product will ever be made which will be totally free from respirable particles.”

The lawsuit also cited a company memo from 1973 that allegedly claimed that its Talc Powder contained “identifiable” amounts of tremolite and actinolite, two types of asbestos fibers.

Rokita’s office accused Johnson & Johnson of failing to disclose any of the potential risks associated with its Talc Powder due to a fear of rising costs and negative public reaction.

Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association, a lobbying organization Johnson & Johnson was part of, reportedly refuted the claims at the time, stating, “There is no basis to Petitioner’s request that cosmetic talc products should bear warning labels to the effect that talcum

powder causes cancer in laboratory animals or the ‘frequent talc application in the female genital

area increases the risk of ovarian cancer.’”

A study that was published out of Harvard University in 1982 contradicted the claims made by various studies sponsored by Johnson & Johnson which claimed that talc powder was completely safe for use, according to the lawsuit.

The Harvard study found that women who used talc saw an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer rise to 92% and advised that Johnson & Johnson display a warning on its talc products. The company did not add any warnings to the products.

The lawsuit also referenced multiple other independent studies which corroborated the Harvard study.

Despite the dangers of using talc powder being well documented by this point, the lawsuit alleged that Johnson & Johnson continued to market its Talc Powder products as being completely safe.

“Despite knowing for over 30 years of studies linking the use of Talc Products in the genital area with increased risk of ovarian cancer, J&J continued to refuse to include any warning or information in its marketing of the Talc Products,” the lawsuit said. “Instead, J&J continued to market the products as safe for daily use on all areas of the body.”

It wasn’t until 2019 that Johnson & Johnson issued a public recall of its Baby Powder after the United States Food and Drug Administration found asbestos in a bottle. It took the company another year before it completely stopped all manufacturing, sale and distribution of the talc-based baby powder in May of 2020.

Johnson & Johnson shared the following statement with FOX59/CBS4 Tuesday:

“Consistent with the plan we outlined last year, the Company continues to pursue several paths to achieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc litigation. That progress includes the finalization of a previously announced agreement that the Company reached with a consortium of 43 State Attorneys Generals to resolve their talc claims. We will continue to address the claims of those who do not want to participate in our contemplated consensual bankruptcy resolution through litigation or settlement.” Erik Haas, Worldwide Vice President of Litigation, Johnson & Johnson

Last month, Johnson & Johnson confirmed that it was moving forward with plans to conclude tens of thousands of nationwide lawsuits with a proposed $6.48 billion settlement.",announced plans for new office
153,Indigenous businesses plan to take ownership of Northwestel,https://cabinradio.ca/187521/news/economy/infrastructure/telecoms/indigenous-businesses-plan-to-take-ownership-of-northwestel/,3 дня назад,"A consortium of Indigenous companies from the Yukon, NWT and Nunavut has announced plans to buy Northwestel.

Sixty North Unity said in a Tuesday news release it intends to acquire the North’s main telecommunications service from Bell Canada. The consortium said that will make Northwestel the world’s largest telecoms company with full Indigenous ownership.

“As Indigenous people, we have long believed we are best placed to make the necessary decisions affecting services in our communities,” Sixty North Unity’s Tiffany Eckert-Maret was quoted as saying. Eckert-Maret, from the Yukon, is leading the bid alongside the NWT’s Darrell Beaulieu and Nunavut’s David Omilgoitok.

“The acquisition of Northwestel will give us autonomy to make those investments and choices to serve our telecommunications needs into the future,” said Eckert-Maret.

According to the news release, the transaction will be worth up to $1 billion in cash. Closing of the sale is subject to conditions and Bell said it plans to use the proceeds to pay down debt.

Sixty North Unity said it is planning “significant capital investment” to improve connectivity across the North. It said that will include doubling internet speeds to one gigabit per second for fibre customers, expanding high-speed internet availability to more than 97 percent of homes in the Yukon and NWT, and offering low-Earth orbit satellite technology to satellite-served communities in the NWT and Nunavut, a development Northwestel had already been pursuing.

The consortium added it will invest $4 million into a project that aims to develop a submarine fibre line across Great Slave Lake to Yellowknife, providing redundancy if the main fibre line along the highway is disrupted.

Sixty North Unity said it intends to maintain Northwestel’s employee base and increase Indigenous representation in the workforce through training and mentorship.

“This monumental step towards economic reconciliation will see direct benefits stay in northern Indigenous communities,” Curtis Shaw, president of Northwestel, said in a statement.

“I can’t wait to see what advancements this new partnership will bring to northern Canadians.”",announced plans for new office

286,Internal Office Moves: 6 Tips for Onsite Office Relocations,https://www.chipmanrelo.com/commercial/resources/internal-office-moves-tips/,,"Businesses often underestimate the complexity of inter-office or internal office moves. While you may think moving an office to another floor in the same building or a different area on your corporate campus will be much less hectic than relocating across town, any office move requires proper planning to avoid unnecessary business disruptions and prevent lost revenue and costly disasters.

Consider the following six tips when planning your internal office move:

Begin planning your move as soon as possible. Planning tops any moving checklist, as it is the most important part of a move. Whether you are moving hundreds of workstations to a different building on campus or moving equipment and cubicles to re-carpet your office, planning and scheduling each step in advance makes your move more efficient and helps eliminate the headaches office moves can bring. Get tips for planning an office move here. Select a project manager who has the time to handle overseeing all of the details of your move. Office managers generally have a full schedule, so consider another employee with excellent organizational skills or hire an outside move management specialist. Hire professional movers. Although a moving van may not be required, experienced office movers have the training and resources needed to ensure your internal office move is a safe one without damage or injury. From correctly disassembling and reassembling workstations to moving heavy furniture and storage cabinets, office movers know how to do the job right and eliminate the dangers and chaos an office move can bring. Some professional office movers can also provide move management and take care of all of the moving details for you. If possible, schedule the move outside of office hours. Moving after hours or on weekends minimizes disruption to your business operations. Notify your building manager about the move in advance. If you are not moving during business hours, the building manager may need to make arrangements for someone to allow your movers access to the building. If moving during normal business hours, you may need to reserve elevators. Some buildings require advance notice and specific precautionary measures such as placing Masonite on the floor when moving heavy objects. Take advantage of the move. This is a great opportunity for you to redesign your office and maximize the efficiency of space. With the right planning, redesigning your office space can improve staff productivity and create a more pleasant work environment.

489,Is the Open Office Dying?,https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10923-is-open-office-dead.html,,"Many modern workplaces evolved from the traditional model of management offices and worker cubicles to include more open setups with “hot” desks and rotating conference rooms. These open office environments enjoyed popularity and were a thriving trend.

Amid the pandemic and the ensuing rise in remote work, however, many professionals wondered if the open office would become a thing of the past. While office buildings are no longer largely dormant as they were during the height of the pandemic, office life has shifted to more flexible workplaces and hybrid arrangements.

We’ll look at the current state of the open office, address its future, and explore whether it was even a good idea in the first place.

Editor’s note: Need cubicles for your business? Fill out the below questionnaire to have our vendor partners contact you with free information.

What is an open office? Open offices and private offices have stark differences. An open office floor plan has collaborative desk environments, rotating conference rooms and potentially even free-use offices. Whereas traditional offices feature many cubicles in an open floor plan, an open office offers tables or half-cubes where workers directly face and sit next to one another without any kind of separation. An open office has the following goals: Collaboration and innovation: An open office’s primary goals are collaboration and innovation. Ideally, the open office fosters constant team member communication, including organic brainstorming sessions and quick, productivity-related questions.

An open office’s primary goals are collaboration and innovation. Ideally, the open office fosters constant team member communication, including organic brainstorming sessions and quick, productivity-related questions. No physical hierarchy: The open office removes the physical hierarchy within a corporate structure. An intern may sit next to a business development VP, and an executive may take calls within earshot of other employees. The open office allows a breakdown in traditional corporate roles, further fostering a free-thinking, collaborative environment. While the open floor plan encourages collaboration, removes the physical structures of employment hierarchy and can save businesses money on office space, it’s unclear if the open layout leads to more productivity. Key Takeaway Key takeaway For open offices to succeed, everyone must abide by open office etiquette practices, such as respecting co-workers' privacy, keeping noise levels down and being considerate of others' needs.

Is the open office dying? The open office format was trendy and popular before the pandemic. Well-known Silicon Valley companies led the way, presenting images of free-thinking, collaborative environments. However, the pandemic prompted an unprecedented rise in remote work and hybrid work schedules. The open office may be falling out of favor for the following reasons. The hybrid work trend: A McKinsey survey found that 90 percent of company executives planned to offer some kind of hybrid work option in the future, and a Cisco study found that 82 percent of workers said hybrid work environments have made them happier and more motivated. Happier and more motivated employees lead to increased productivity — the goal of every office.

Studies show that working from home increases productivity for many employees and boosts their overall happiness and work-life balance. Again, happier, more productive employees benefit employers. A need for privacy: Today’s workers want private workspaces. According to a survey on office design and performance, 3 in 5 Americans reported needing private workspaces to produce their best work. While reverting to a cubicle-based layout is an option, many workers aren’t cubicle fans. Cubicles can create the illusion of privacy, but workers must still deal with noisy offices and privacy issues. Options beyond cubicles and open office layouts must be considered. Remote and hybrid work arrangements are emerging as favorable options for entrepreneurs and small business owners. Future workspaces will likely include a work-from-home option and an in-office option. However, the in-office option may evolve into a completely new kind of space that blends various workspace types so that employees can work productively in different environments. Tip Tip Ways to stay productive in a noisy office include wearing earplugs or headphones, planning assignments according to the office's volume level, and focusing on one task at a time.

What are the pros of open offices? Although they’re not as popular as they used to be, open offices have upsides that may be attractive to some business owners, including the following: Open offices create a collaborative team setting. Open offices can be great setups for many companies, depending on their team structure and the nature of their work.

453,J.P. Morgan | Official Website,https://www.jpmorgan.com/,,"Voiceover: Welcome to Market Matters, our markets podcast on Making Sense, the hub for J.P. Morgan corporate and investment bank podcasts. In each episode of Market Matters, we discuss the latest news and trends shaping markets today.



Eloise: Hi, I'm Eloise Goulder, head of the Data Assets and Alpha Group here at J.P. Morgan. And today I'm really excited to be joined by my colleagues Andrew Tyler and John Schlegel to talk about U.S. equities following a bit of weakness over the last few weeks. As a reminder, for those of you who don't know, Drew is head of our U.S. market intelligence team and John is head of our global positioning intelligence team.



As always, I'm looking forward to hearing their perspectives on markets from here. So, Drew, John, thank you so much for being here today.



Drew: Thanks for having us. It's great to be here.



John: Yes, great to be with you both.



Eloise: And you're at the start of your week-long London trip. So how are things going so far?



Drew: So far so good. It's always nice to be across.



John: Things are well so far. It's a busy week, but we're looking forward to it.



Eloise: Brilliant. So, Drew, can we start with you?



U.S. equities have obviously been very strong on a six -month view. The S &P 500 is up 24 % from late October lows. But U.S. markets have been weak in recent weeks, losing almost 6 % peak to trough in the first three weeks of April, albeit rebounding a little bit last week. So Drew, can you start by discussing why you think we've seen this bout of equity weakness through April?



Drew: Certainly. So the S&P made all-time highs on March 28th at a little over 5,200.



So that was the day before the Good Friday market holiday. So the next three weeks saw that S&P sell-off that you just referenced, and that also kind of happened as the 10-year yield surged a bit more than 40 basis points. So NASDAQ 100, as well as the Russell 2000, underperformed the S&P by 121 basis points and 287 basis points respectively. So what triggered the sell-off?



So it appears to be a combination of hotter than expected inflation data, which triggered a reprice of the yield curve alongside valuation fears, stress positioning, and general rebalancing of portfolios. So returning to that point on inflation, what we saw was bond markets rapidly reassessing Powell's dovish pivot from December of last year. So the first quarter of 2024, what we saw was an increase in inflation that made investors nervous. And that was illustrated by the bond market going from pricing multiple rate cuts this year, to now being about a coin flip if we even see one rate cut.



So that said, the inflation trend appears to have been a spike in January and then a disinflationary trend throughout the quarter. And this is all based upon the data we saw from the PCE that was released last week, which is the Fed's preferred measure of inflation, not CPI. So another thing to kind of flag is that the Fed has a meeting this week and the market is preparing for a more hawkish tone. And so to kind of sum this up, while the bar to cut rates is very high, the bar to hike is even farther away.



Eloise: Thanks, Drew, that makes sense. So when we think about the equities path from here, what are your views? I mean, you've been bullish equities for over a year now, as you've articulated many times on this podcast series, but the S&P 500 has gained 24 % since last October. And as you say, there are now renewed inflation and hawkish Fed type risks. So when you put it all together, where do you see markets going from here?



Drew: Yeah, that's a great question. So I would say that I remain tactfully bullish. And so the hypothesis can be summarized as this. If you have at or above trend GDP growth, combine that with positive earnings growth and a paused Fed, and that's a bull market for stocks. And that's really what we've seen play out over the last year and a half. So while we have seen a volatile month in April as bond yields surge with the 10-year yield increasing again more than 40 some odd points month to date, none of this has changed the hypothesis materially.



So while Q1 GDP of this year, so 2024 Q1 GDP, did disappoint, this disappointment was mainly due to a surge in imports. And again, that's the consumer spending, albeit on non-US goods. And so what we have seen recently is the U.S. chief economist, Mike Feroli, he did increase his 2024 Q2 estimates for GDP from 1.5 % to 2.5%. And this is being driven by the strength of the U.S. consumer.



And as a reminder, consumption is more than two thirds of the U.S. economy. That consumer strength is what underlies my bullish hypothesis dating back to January of 2023. I think the U.S. consumer will continue to surprise to the upside, pushing equities higher, irrespective of the path of bond yields. That said, the pace at which bond yields move can be a headwind to equities, as evidenced by April's price moves.



Eloise: Thanks, Drew. That's all really helpful. And what a huge upgrade to Q2 2024 GDP forecast from our US chief economist from 1 .5 % to 2 .5%. So, Drew, under this bullish scenario that you hold, which sectors do you think will lead? I mean, over the last six months, tech and consumer discretionary have led. Do you think that continues or do you expect a broadening of the rally?



Drew: So I do think that tech- and AI-related plays will continue to lead the market.



But I do expect that rally to broaden, especially as bond yields stabilize and the market narrative, which had been one of Goldilocks, then shifted towards stagflation, now returning to soft landing. So it's important to note that the rally since late October has actually been fairly broad. So the S&P returned 24%, as you mentioned, but it's also important to note that the Russell 2000 returned more than 22%.



And so if the rally had been a bit more narrow, then you would have seen the divergence between the S&P and the Russell 2000 even larger than that 2% move. And yet another way to consider breadth would be the percentage of S&P 500 members trading above their 200 day moving average, with higher levels meaning more broadness. The average this year has been 75% of those members trading above their 200-day moving average. And this compares to a five -year average of 62%. And since the October lows, that number has averaged 70%.



So I guess another way of saying this is like since that October lows, we've actually seen a very broad based rally. Now it hasn't all been consistent across the last six months, but that's basically what we've seen.



Eloise: Yes, I think that's a brilliant point and it's often underestimated or understated, I'd argue, that the rally over the last six months has been pretty broad.



So on that theme, which sectors in addition to tech- and AI-related plays do you really expect to outperform from here?



Drew: Yeah, so the two-eyed highlight would be financials and industrials and also to kind of within that AI theme, which is going to be very, very powerful, I think, for the rest of this year and potentially throughout 2025. I think people are really going to look for the second and third order plays and not just the handful of names that people recognize.



Eloise: Yeah, makes sense. So you're clearly relying on continued robust U.S. economic growth, plus, as you say, some stability in bond yields to support your bullish equity view



In this context, what are the key catalysts you'll be watching to confirm or potentially to refute this view?



Drew: No, absolutely. So from a macro perspective, I would say that you want to see the ISM prints remain in expansion territory, aka above 50. And then you really need to see CPI stabilize with a preference for a disinflationary trend to resume. So, shifting gears and thinking about this from a micro perspective, it's really the earnings from mega-cap tech and AI-related themes that are most important to markets. But more generally, you want to see earnings growth remain positive. So far, through this earnings season with about half of the S&P companies reporting, that's what we're seeing.



Shifting gears and thinking about the risks, I would highlight macro data that points to a recession, such as non-farm payrolls approaching zero or perhaps even going negative, a spike to unemployment rate, significant declines to consumption, a negative earnings season on either a quarter over a quarter or year over year basis or just in general a spike to inflation.



Eloise: Thank you, Drew. John, over to you. So first of all, with the S&P 500 down about 3% now post the peaks in late March, how much selling have you seen amid this and from who?



John: So that's a great question. I think, you know, given the sell off, it's not surprising that we've seen a number of investor types selling. And I would argue actually it's been very broad. So the types of investors that we see kind of negative flows in cover, you know, the asset managers, the CTAs, hedge funds, even retail sentiment getting a bit more bearish.



So across the board, it seems like it's taking a more negative tone. And if we look at our tactical positioning monitor, the four week change has reached a negative two standard deviation level as of late last week. So, overall, that would suggest it's been a pretty negative skew in the positioning changes, but really coming from a broad base of investors.



Eloise: That's really interesting. Thank you. So where does that leave positioning today?



John: So positioning, to just back up a little bit, had been elevated for a long period of time. It's one of the things that we've kind of noted in the past. We saw a huge increase in positioning in late last year and got to about the 90th percentile by mid to late December and it stayed elevated throughout the next call it three and a half four months and so coming off of those levels that were around the 90th percentile, which is where we arguably were about a month ago, we're down to basically neutral. So our overall aggregate positioning score is 0.1 standard variations now, so basically at average and it's really come from, once again, if I look at the underlying components, we have hedge funds who have taken down their net leverage a bit for the long short funds down to about the 70th percentile, they were as high as the 85th percentile a few weeks ago. If I look at CTAs, they were running around the 90th percentile versus data over the past 20 plus years and that's down to about the 40th percentile. So, you know, across the board and I could go through other stats, but in general, the story is one of going from elevated level positioning as the markets continue to rally throughout Q1 to a very neutral level as of late April.



Eloise: Thank you. Well, in a way, I think it's quite surprising that positioning levels have dropped so significantly back to neutral levels versus history, in spite of the fact that U.S. markets, the S&P 500 is still up a full 24%, as we've said, over the last six months. And on the face of it, given the bullish fundamental backdrop that Drew just articulated, that could be quite an attractive setup for equities. I mean, is that your base case from here, John?



John: So at this stage, it is our base case. Part of this is because when we look at the negative four -week changes in our tactical positioning monitor, it did trigger what we consider an attractive setup for US equities as of early last week. And so typically, the one to four-week increases are better following those scenarios than they are on average. And even it extends on a three-month period. So arguably, that negative impulse does suggest a better and cleaner setup for equities going forward.



If I think about like how much positioning came off, given the rally and that we're still up so much, as you mentioned earlier, I think part of what this reflects is that the rally wasn't simply a positioning move. And a lot of this came from the combination of strong macro data, strong earnings and things that Drew has articulated multiple times in the past. And so you don't necessarily need positioning to keep going up or it can be high and the markets can still work if the underlying data is strong.



And so, in terms of what this could mean in terms of the drop in positioning and where we are today, there's some amount of this that looks very similar to the fall of last year, where in August, you had a similar level of market decline, similar level of positioning decline, things stabilized for a few weeks and actually rebounded a bit, and then they sold off further.



And the main catalyst for that was concerns about a recession as well as rates going higher. And so I think some of those risks are still there, but at the moment, as long as rates stay contained and the growth narrative holds up, I think this positioning being neutral could be supportive for equities in the near term. And then the one other scenario that we're thinking about, which once again points to a bit more positivity in the near term, but more mixed outlook in the medium term, is the late 2010 to early 2011 period.



So the way the markets performed into that period, the way positioning was and how elevated it was for a long period of time, it looks very similar across none of these metrics. And if we think about what happened there, after you got the pullback, which was about 6 .5%, I think, in March of 2011, you saw markets actually rally a little over 8%, but stay kind of range-bound over the next, call it three to four months. And so, there's some of that that does seem appropriate as sort of an analogue to what we're seeing today and where we could see things go.



Eloise: Thank you, John. And just going back to this neutral aggregate positioning level that you see in US markets, I mean, that's what you see at the index level. Presumably, there's a lot of bifurcation under the surface.



Which sectors do you see as particularly stretched and which sectors do you see with lighter positioning at this stage?



John: So I think it's probably no surprise that one of the most well-owned sectors remains tech in the U.S. I think it's not necessarily all coming from funds chasing the performance. It depends on which investor type we're talking about. But overall, I would argue tech across investor types is still one of the most well-owned.



And so, you know, it needs the earnings to be there, I would argue, to keep things going. On the flip side, you know, with more bearish positioning, we see at least from hedge funds is actually in some of the consumer related plays. So there's been a bit of bearishness that's crept into some of the retail stocks, which arguably had performed very well prior to this month. Also, some of the home builders have seen some selling. And I would argue generally some of the consumer plays is where we see that more of that negativity. And one of the areas that we still see a bit of reticence to really buy into what's been a decent rally, at least earlier this year, is banks. I know that's one Drew mentioned. It's one that still seems very interesting to me, because even in the large cap banks, which have done better than some of the regional banks, we don't see funds willing to really buy into that in a meaningful way in the US. And so I think there's still arguably a decent amount of positioning upside, both from the hedge fund and ETF perspective.



Eloise: So banks seems to be the sector that Drew believes in fundamentally and John, you're highlighting that positioning is particularly light there. So certainly one to watch. Thank you. So final question for you, John, from your perspective, are there any other catalysts or risk factors that you would be watching?



John: Yeah. So I think the one that's come up the most throughout the last few months is risk to a momentum unwind which generally means the stocks that had been winning for a long time start to underperform, the stocks that have been lagging starting to outperform.



We've seen momentum in the U.S. as a factor be pretty choppy despite the market sell off. And I think, you know, the key risk, in my opinion, is rates going down because of better inflation data that gets some of the laggards, small caps or riskier stocks to see a decent cover bid on the short side. And I mention this because when we look at the sensitivity of hedge fund positioning and performance to momentum as a factor, a lot of it, or the majority of it, really comes from the short side.



So if you get that impulse of rates down for the right reasons, and you get new life breathes into some of those companies that have been pressured by the higher rate environment, I think that's the catalyst where you could see a bit more of this rotation, arguably in probably a rallying market of the laggers once again, sort of coming back to the fore and outperforming.



Eloise: Thank you. So between the two of you, you've really identified two quite distinct risks there. Drew, on the one hand, identifying the hawkish narrative, higher inflation, Fed not cutting perhaps this year in the way that we had expected. And that could, in the extreme, be negative for markets. But on the other hand, John, you highlighting that actually if bond deals come down from here and macro data remains strong and it's positive for equities as a whole, that could be negative for momentum because of course the short leg could disproportionately rally and that could hurt hedge fund returns.



John: That's correct. Yep.



Eloise: Great. Well, thank you both, Drew and John, for articulating such clear views once again. Lots to watch from here. Really appreciate you coming in and taking the time to record this with me.



Drew: Well, thanks for hosting us. It's been a pleasure.

This annual adjustment ensures that our salary range midpoints continue to reflect the median compensation rates in the external market for our jobs.

Although budget constraints limit the size and number of salary increases that can be awarded, we believe accurate awareness of the new ranges and external market is critical for managers to assess competing demands for limited financial resources and make optimal pay decisions.

We have created an online dashboard you may use to review the compensation for your employees in refined job families. Although this report will be able to be accessed here all year, please note the data in the dashboard will only be refreshed January 31, 2024.

A report will display that includes your direct and indirect reports who are in refined jobs families.

You can use this report for the following:

Compare the former and new range midpoint for each employee to see how the market moved for the job they are in. You can also see how this market movement affected the employee’s compa-ratio.

Check to see if the salary grade for any of your employees went up to a higher grade. This will be highlighted in purple and indicates that the market for this job moved more quickly than the market in general.

Check to see if the salary grade for any of your employees went down to a lower grade. This will be highlighted in blue and indicates that the market for this job dropped from last year.

Identify employees who will be receiving increases to bring their salaries to the new range minimums, highlighted in red.

Make note of employees with compa-ratios below 0.75. These employees are in jobs that have salary range minimums that will be phased upwards over time. We encourage you to give extra consideration to these employees when allocating salary increases, with the goal of eventually getting them to a compa ratio of at least .75.

Make note of any employees with compa-ratios above 1.25. These employees are currently paid above the salary range maximum for their job code. They should receive their annual increase, if one is provided, in the form of a lump sum payment until their salary falls within the pay range.

53,"Kennan and Containment, 1947",https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/kennan,,"Kennan and Containment,

George F. Kennan, a career Foreign Service Officer, formulated the policy of “containment,” the basic United States strategy for fighting the cold war (1947–1989) with the Soviet Union.

Kennan’s ideas, which became the basis of the Truman administration’s foreign policy, first came to public attention in 1947 in the form of an anonymous contribution to the journal Foreign Affairs, the so-called “X-Article.” “The main element of any United States policy toward the Soviet Union,” Kennan wrote, “must be that of a long-term, patient but firm and vigilant containment of Russian expansive tendencies.” To that end, he called for countering “Soviet pressure against the free institutions of the Western world” through the “adroit and vigilant application of counter-force at a series of constantly shifting geographical and political points, corresponding to the shifts and maneuvers of Soviet policy.” Such a policy, Kennan predicted, would “promote tendencies which must eventually find their outlet in either the break-up or the gradual mellowing of Soviet power.”

Kennan’s policy was controversial from the very beginning. Columnist Walter Lippmann attacked the X-Article for failing to differentiate between vital and peripheral interests. The United States, Kennan’s article implied, should face down the Soviet Union and its Communist allies whenever and wherever they posed a risk of gaining influence. In fact, Kennan advocated defending above all else the world’s major centers of industrial power against Soviet expansion: Western Europe, Japan, and the United States. Others criticized Kennan’s policy for being too defensive. Most notably, John Foster Dulles declared during the 1952 election campaign that the United States’ policy should not be containment, but the “rollback” of Soviet power and the eventual “liberation” of Eastern Europe. Even within the Truman administration there was a rift over containment between Kennan and Paul Nitze, Kennan’s successor as director of the Policy Planning Staff. Nitze, who saw the Soviet threat primarily in military terms, interpreted Kennan’s call for “the adroit and vigilant application of counter-force” to mean the use of military power. In contrast, Kennan, who considered the Soviet threat to be primarily political, advocated above all else economic assistance (e.g., the Marshall Plan) and “psychological warfare” (overt propaganda and covert operations) to counter the spread of Soviet influence. In 1950, Nitze’s conception of containment won out over Kennan’s. NSC 68, a policy document prepared by the National Security Council and signed by Truman, called for a drastic expansion of the U.S. military budget. The paper also expanded containment’s scope beyond the defense of major centers of industrial power to encompass the entire world. “In the context of the present polarization of power,” it read, “a defeat of free institutions anywhere is a defeat everywhere.”

Despite all the criticisms and the various policy defeats that Kennan suffered in the early 1950’s, containment in the more general sense of blocking the expansion of Soviet influence remained the basic strategy of the United States throughout the cold war. On the one hand, the United States did not withdraw into isolationism; on the other, it did not move to “roll back” Soviet power, as John Foster Dulles briefly advocated. It is possible to say that each succeeding administration after Truman’s, until the collapse of communism in 1989, adopted a variation of Kennan’s containment policy and made it their own.",plans to expand office
692,Key Steps in Setting Up Operations and Offices in a New ...,https://www.selluseller.com/resources/blogs/key-steps-setting-up-offices-new-country,,"Expansion, the graal for most business leaders, is an exciting and adventurous chapter for companies of all sizes. And for any such project, preparation is key before taking the big leap. As Country Head for Malaysia and Thailand, I have taken this leap twice in my professional career. Vishal Desai Country Head Malaysia & Thailand

At Anchanto, we don't fear the jump, however wide the gap is. The reason is the confidence we have in our products and teams of course, but also because we always act with the same mindset: be humble, and learn from every mistake.

Early on, we realized that opening an office and executing operations in a new country can be complex and layered. From understanding cultural differences to investing in local setup costs, hiring the right talent to finding a suitable office space, right to knowing local HR and tax rules when you sign your first customers, a large number of factors contribute to your success (or failure).

You may ask, then, is it worth it for a start-up to open new markets before owning another one?

From my experience - it sure is!

But before you go for it, which you totally should, I shall present some key steps that I have learned along the way, illustrate them with examples of establishing operations in Malaysia.





Step 1: Studying the Market

Every market is unique, has its own set of challenges and opportunities.

Observing the market is the first step to establishing a strong presence there. But, that’s easier said than done, as it is important to figure out what this study actually means - and it cannot be desktop research based on some Google queries and blogs (like this one), but has to be on the ground and by sweating it out - sometimes that also means genuinely going door to door.

You must make sure you understand the laws and regulations, cultural and community differences, and analyze the business environment before you choose a market for expansion.

Being aware of the local market and cultural norms, especially in a diverse country like Malaysia with at least a trio of core cultures, it’s a challenge to relish. It helped us establish our presence in the country faster. And the only way to do it was to travel regularly and spend time meeting prospects, associations, and sometimes even competitors.

Make sure you share a coffee with your competitor's sales team. You might or might not get your next hire, but you surely will understand the customers’ pulse.

Step 2: Selecting the Right Time

Choosing when to enter a market contributes to your success or failure remarkably.

The right time to enter a new market depends on factors like the demand for your product, the readiness of the brands to adopt the right solution, and the environment in which your business is likely to operate.

Back in 2018, primarily due to Government initiatives and active steps taken by marketplaces, Malaysia was already abuzz with eCommerce. Major investments from and other telecom companies led to a growing enthusiasm of brands, retailers, and distributors.

The timing thus felt right for the management to give me the responsibility to analyze Malaysia as a prospective market. I worked to understand our product proposition and the market needs before jumping in.

The demand for eCommerce technology was present, and Malaysian brands were waiting for the right solution to be offered. The competition did exist, but wasn’t known to handle large volume or work with non-Malaysian marketplaces. In fact, it stayed away from integrating with webstores (Shopify, Magento, WooCommerce, etc.).

In summary, we were competing with many other products, which acted as singular plugins, whilst we provided a comprehensive solution to most of the pain points in eCommerce enablement and fulfillment, thus making it the perfect time for us to enter this market.

Interestingly, this situation is still the same, and we have progressed quite ahead while our competitors still lag behind.

Step 3: Asking the Right Questions

When examining a new business environment, it is all about asking the right questions. And the right question is one that always raises another one.

If you are a company that offers technology solutions, like us, you need to analyze the challenge from a singular focus on ‘customer experience’. (In our case, this experience is throughout: pre-purchase, purchase, and post-purchase) This would involve preparing a list of questions to determine the best way to approach the new market - but all pointing to the ever-elusive and moving goal of ‘customer needs and wants’.

For us, some of these questions were:

Would our product satisfy strong market demand? Or do we need to actually have a budget to create a demand?

What would be the acceptance of the product? And that too of a Company with no Malaysian brand presence?

What would be the proposition for Malaysia, if we target the market with the same product as we did in others?

What would be the right messaging for Malaysia? Do we need to localize or behave the know-it-all foreign brand?

What would be the customer behavior towards our product, especially about the support and training after the customer subscribes to our platforms?

The best way to find answers to such questions is to interact with your existing customers or key individuals with ample local experience. In-depth local knowledge is critical to prepare yourself for all the situations that will eventually arise.

Step 4: Understanding Challenges of the Market

It is crucial to know the problems prevalent in the market, and how your offerings solve them. And if they do, think about what is the perceived value of this solution. SaaS cannot work on bottom-up pricing, it has to be top-down.

For us, the challenge was a lack of awareness regarding technology tools. Let me explain before you jump out shouting.

Back in 2018, Malaysian eCommerce actors faced operational issues like order processing, inventory management, multichannel selling, etc., that were similar to enterprises in other countries. However, many used the wrong tool for the wrong solution - using an accounting tool to measure inventory, or using a neanderthal aged ERP system to do eCommerce Warehousing.

There was little awareness in the market about technology tools that could assist businesses in managing their end-to-end eCommerce operations - with the ‘right mapping for pain points and value-add’.

This was a huge opportunity for us, as our platforms facilitated seamless eCommerce solutions and it was all about positioning. It wasn’t about merely saving time and money, but it was more about ‘saving time and money smartly’. And such positioning required case-studies and our first bunch of customers.

In short, our offering was just what the Malaysian market needed at that time but the positioning was the key.

Step 5: Defining Strategy for the Market

The next step is to have a strategy in place to battle the potential objections.

The more you are prepared, the easier it will be to navigate the market challenges you are likely to face at various different stages. Having an in-depth understanding of the issues will help you develop a comprehensive strategy, which will help you shape your market approach.

In Malaysia, our focus was to have a clear plan of action in place. This led to an approach that acted as the foundation for our future interactions with customers and changed how our platforms were perceived by them. For us, the strategy focused on:

A. Raising Awareness by interacting with eCommerce associations and government bodies

B. Individual Proposition for each Product, introduced through our first set of customers

C. Addressing the Requirement, and specially attending to customization requests

D. Offering Technology Solutions, with a positioning around OMS (Order Management System) and Warehouse Management System (WMS)





The obvious addition here are the components of strategy, your product positioning being the most crucial of the lot.

Once we knew that the customer did have a pain point, having the right marketing message delivered to the right target was crucial. We decided to not overly localize because that would have given the customer the impression that our product would be available in local languages with local-language support. We are there now, but that wasn’t the case when we launched.

Our product positioning of being end-to-end - right from cataloging, to managing orders to fulfilling them - worked wonders. The very fact that we were able to get acknowledgments from our customers that their time-to-market significantly reduced said a lot about us delivering what we promised.

Not everything can be communicated through marketing. Sales also needed to influence our customers- and our best salespersons were our customers who referred and spoke about us.

Once you establish a strong strategy, with the right tactics planned out, you need to now have infantry and cavalry - Now it's time to have an on-ground team and open a local office.

Step 6: Setting up Office Operations

Prepared with a market study and proper insights, the next step is establish an office and set up operations.

Having a local presence is helpful for a growing business as it allows your clients to have easy access to your teams and vice versa. Not just that, you can choose to be located with the big leagues and grow through this proximity. This is very important especially in eCommerce, as it's a very niche world. Here, the word of good service and humility always spreads quickly.

Accordingly, we made sure of it and found a space that was located near the offices of close partners, like the marketplaces or , and other actors, to fuel our growth.

Co-working spaces made sense, and they still do as we would rather focus on finding and anchanting our next customer rather than worry over soon-to-finish copier paper. Such an arrangement also helped us build the network and we got some of the best customers through our interactions within the office spaces.

Step 7: Establishing a Local Team

While coming to a new country with your existing team members to ensure coherency is great, hiring local team members is essential to find your feet and establish your presence.

Offering regional support from team members who are aware of the nuances and requirements of the market can help you simplify your operations and establish trust with your customers Nothing beats trust - not even a 100% discount.

Earlier (before building local presence), all our operations were done remotely every time we had a new client on board. This was a little complicated. When clients interact with domestic team members, they instantly feel more comfortable. Not just that, it also helps ease operational challenges and reduces the chances of miscommunication. Hence, we realized the need of having a local team in place.

Recruiting was an issue in our first year. We struggled to find the right resources as Malaysia did not represent a mature eCommerce market back then and roles were not very well defined. Also, we were a startup based out of Singapore, and with a fairly new presence in Malaysia. So, we sought help from hiring agencies and sometimes even asked our customers to help us out.

In addition to it, we went back to basics and spread the word across every platform we could get our hands-on. And, the existing team members made sure to talk about the company on every occasion. The trick is to keep trying - Not all platforms worked for us, some did and we kept adapting our marketing and event strategy accordingly.

After the first year, once we had esteemed brands as our customers and established our presence, attracting the right talent became easier.

A lot is learned about the market when you actually interview people. Remember, interviewing doesn’t always have to be about you knowing more about the candidate alone, you get a lot more than just finding your next hire. You might even find your next customer. The golden rule here- never stop talking about your company and product.

Today, we have a sizable number of demanding customers and for them, we have a local team overseeing operations. When a new client comes on board now, everything is managed and done locally, with support from the remote teams across 7 other countries.





We are glad to be working with industry leaders in Malaysia

Throughout our experience, our major learning was: once you set things in motion, new learnings will follow. And once you adapt to these new learnings, it starts feeling like home.

Establishing a global presence is rewarding as well as challenging at the same time. However, if you prepare the right way, have an open mind, keep adapting to local requirements, set realistic goals, and prepare for scenarios of Plan B, you will have all the tools to be successful in the new market. And all of it, the start of the journey and the proverbial hockey stick will be an achievement in itself.",strategizing new office location

Work given the go-ahead at the Gordon Arms Hotel in Fochabers.

Last month, we revealed how the Findochty Methodist Church could be turned into two homes.

Now the cost to give new life to the closed church has been revealed.

Meanwhile, new details have emerged about proposals to build new homes on site of former Buckie police station.

And repairs will be made on an council-owned commercial property in Elgin once home to a vegan cafe.

Meanwhile, amateur football side Aberlour Villa want to build a new pavilion at Dowans Football Ground on the village’s High Street.

A Moray councillor’s proposals to breathe new life into a former Forres newsagents will go up before the planning committee.

We begin our latest instalment with an objection to plans for a popular Elgin entertainment venue to build an extension.

OBJECTION: Pinz extension plans

Moray Council’s flood risk management team has submitted an objection to a well-known Elgin entertainment venue’s plans to build an extension.

For the last 10 years, Pinz Bowling has been operating successfully in Moycroft Industrial Estate in Elgin.

In April, we first revealed owner Darren Margach wanted to build an extension at the south west side of the building which is primarily an indoor bowling arena.

What are the proposals?

S Reid Design is representing him in the proposals.

The owners want to remove the current soft play area and relocate it into the proposed extension.

This play area will be much bigger and replace the existing play zone called Lunar Land.

This soft play zone will also be segregated away from the bowling alley which makes more sense for safety, design and revenue reasons.

Pinz Bowling removed the arcade during the pandemic to accommodate increased demand and more seating for the bowling lanes and the soft play area.

Now, they plan to reinstall the arcade and pool table in the former soft play area space.

These proposals will create around seven full-time jobs and is aimed at meeting the demand for such facilities in Elgin while attracting more visitors to the premises.

Flood experts have concerns

Moray Council’s flood risk management team has submitted an objection to the plans.

The extension is proposed within an area of known surface water flooding.

In August 2019, the Pinz Bowling owner submitted a letter to the local authority about the issue.

Based on the proposals, council officials argue the proposed development would just move the pluvial flooding to another point within the property or towards nearby sites.

They say more evidence including about all risks of flooding and methods to protect the proposed extension and surrounding areas from flood risk are needed.

SUBMITTED: New purpose for Forres newsagents

In April, we reported on how councillor Draeyk Van Der Horn wanted to breathe new life into a vacant retail unit in Forres.

We revealed the former paper shop Sue’s News at 128 High Street could be turned into a gallery.

According to a building warrant, the transformation could cost around £15,000.

What’s happening?

In May, a planning application was submitted to renovate the retail unit.

The proposed work includes:

Replacing single glazed front shop windows with timber double glazed windows.

Installing two heritage skylights in the rear extension.

Adding an air conditioning unit on the rear elevation.

Refurbishing the existing storm door.

Repainting the front elevation in a similar colour.

Removing the existing shop fitting and creating a new store area.

Refurbishing two windows on the rear of the building.

Removing a hanging sign and bracket, and a wall-mounted sign.

Now the work on the vacant unit is recommended for planning approval and will go before members of Moray Council planning committee on Thursday.

These plans are going in front of councillors because applicant Mr Van Der Horn is involved in the planning process.

APPROVED: Repairs on Elgin High Street building

Earlier this week, we revealed Moray Council were given the go-ahead to make repairs at three-storey C-listed building at 239 Elgin High Street.

It is hoped the work on the building held in the Elgin Common Good will attract a new business to the Elgin town centre.

The ground level unit was most recently let out as a cafe with residential accommodation on the upper floors.

In April, we first reported on the local authority’s work on the vacant Elgin commercial property.

Now the council has been given listed building consent to carry out repairs including new roof lights, secondary glazing to current windows and loft insulation.

Meanwhile, repairs will be made to stonework and roof coverings on a like-for-like basis.

Finally one chimney stack will be dismantled and rebuilt with new stone.

A council spokeswoman said once the work is completed, they intend to put the property on the market to lease.

The property’s most recent use

Elgin’s first-ever vegan eatery Cafe Kombucha was the most recent tenant for this unit.

Sarah Borthwick ran the cafe on Elgin High Street for four years.

It impressed locals from the get-go with its fresh, seasonal, and vibrant vegan offering.

In July 2022, she announced she would be closing the cafe before the “price hike” in the October.

SUBMITTED: New details about homes proposed on site of former Buckie police station

Last July, we revealed work had started to demolish the former Buckie police station.

Then three months later, Milne Property Developments Limited lodged plans to build five three bedroom homes at the site.

The proposals include 10 car parking spaces.

History of Buckie police station

In 2013, the station on South West Street was closed as officers moved into new premises at East Cathcart Street.

At the time, the force wanted to strengthen its presence in the community.

Politicians said the move would stand officers in good stead for the launch of Scotland’s single force.

Since then, it has lain empty.

When in operation, the building’s ground floor had a reception office, ten offices, six cells, toilets and locker room with toilets.

Meanwhile, the first floor had a locker room and staffroom with kitchenette.

Latest on the plans

The site is empty after work was completed to demolish the derelict police station.

With the proposals still awaiting planning permission.

Now a building warrant has been submitted for £562,657.80 worth of work to build new homes on the site.

Meanwhile, each home will include a sun lounge, private garden and two parking spaces including a disabled parking space.

SUBMITTED: New purpose for closed Findochty Church

Jean Stalker wants to give a closed church a new lease of life.

Last September, Findochty Methodist Church on Seaview Road closed its doors after 107 years serving the local community.

In 1916, it was built as the Methodist movement grew across the Moray Firth.

What are the plans for the church?

In May, we revealed how she wanted to transform the former church into two homes.

Other work could include a new pedestrian access gate to the south boundary wall.

One local described the plans as “very sympathetic” to the area and “much better” than leaving the building to rot.

David Dittman is representing Mrs Stalker in the proposals.

The plans are still awaiting approval.

Now according to a building warrant, the transformation of the former church could cost around £300,000.

APPROVED: Changes at Gordon Arms Hotel

In March, we revealed how Highland Travel Inns wanted to carry out £60,000 worth of work at Gordon Arms Hotel in Fochabers.

The hotel currently has 16 bedrooms, all of which have en-suite facilities.

It used to be a coaching inn and now has served guests for over 200 years.

Now a building warrant has been approved for alterations to be made to the current bedrooms and a new bedroom to be added to the hotel at 80 High Street.

S Reid Design represented the hotel owners in the application.

SUBMITTED: New pavilion for Aberlour football team

Meanwhile, amateur football side Aberlour Villa want to build a new pavilion at Dowans Football Ground on the village’s High Street.

In 2021, we revealed the club’s intention to replace its current pavilion which was no-longer fit for purpose.

This year, the club founded in 1924 will mark 100 years since Fred Stewart, ‘Chattie’ Calder, ‘Winkie’ Milton, Harvey Annan and Ronald McGovan set up the club.

The club has produced many players who have gone on to play at a higher level including Scotland capped goalie Nicky Walker who starred for the likes of Leicester, Rangers, Partick Thistle, Hearts and Aberdeen.

The new facility will feature a community hall, kitchen/dining area and eight showers (four in each changing room).

Grant And Geoghegan Limited is representing the football team in the proposals.

52,MD of Bighorn adds office trailers to ease staffing space ...,https://www.rmoutlook.com/md-of-bighorn/md-of-bighorn-adds-office-trailers-to-ease-staffing-space-crunch-8981905,3 дня назад,"“You’ve probably noticed a few new faces in this building. The team has grown quite significantly in the last few months and we don’t have room for everybody anymore.”

MD OF BIGHORN – Space is getting tight at the MD of Bighorn administration office in Exshaw.

The MD’s municipal planning commission (MPC) approved the addition of two ATCO office trailers on site to help temporarily accommodate recent hires and any future MD of Bighorn staffing additions before the municipal district’s new operations shop is scheduled for completion about two years from now.

“You’ve probably noticed a few new faces in this building. The team has grown quite significantly in the last few months and we don’t have room for everybody anymore,” said Bighorn’s director of planning and development services Hayley Gavin.

“This is a temporary measure. … Once the [operations shop] is constructed and the occupancy certificate is issued, the basement here will basically get cleared out, as well as the staff who are going to be utilizing the ATCO office trailers, and then we would no longer need those at this location.”

Just in recent months, the MD has hired five new full-time staff members – a deputy fire chief, infrastructure services engineer, communications coordinator, manager of operational services and a human resources and payroll coordinator.

The MD already has a 10-foot by 32-foot ATCO trailer for temporary office space behind the administration building that has been there since July 2022 but had not yet been approved by MPC. The MD’s development permit also includes the addition of a second 10-foot by 24-foot trailer. Each accommodates two offices.

The MD of Bighorn has long planned to build a new administration building to address space constraints and growing administrative needs; however, plans have been repeatedly pushed back. It was last earmarked for construction in 2025, but 2024 budget discussions slated it for 2029, recognizing the number of capital projects and associated costs the MD has planned over the next several years.

Gavin noted the addition of another ATCO trailer will impact on-site parking.

The existing trailer takes up two staff parking stalls and the new one would occupy another two stalls.

“Parking is definitely a consideration with this one. We have a pretty small parking lot here and, of course, with all the additional staff members, it does tend to get crowded some days,” she said.

The MD has implemented a compressed work schedule for eligible employees, allowing staff to work remotely up to two days per week, or work longer days to earn one day off every four weeks. Some staff are also required to park at the existing operations facility located on the north side of Mount Allen Drive.

Gavin said, this, along with staff carpooling, has helped alleviate some parking pressures, but not all. She acknowledged there are some staff also using parking stalls designated for the public in front of the building.

She further noted adding additional parking stalls to the site is not feasible. The property is bound to the north by Exshaw School, to the west by the Lafarge Exshaw Cement Plant, to the east by the rear alley of Mount Allen Drive and to the south by Highway 1A.

The development permit also came with a 2.75-metre variance request to the rear yard of the administration building – a 54 per cent relaxation to the minimum rear yard setback requirement.

Planning commissioner and one of council’s representatives Alice James asked about the MD’s compliance with on-site parking availability and expressed concern about public parking availability.

“I just want to be sure that the public always has a place to park in front of the building and that if we’re not able to do that, that we find alternative parking somewhere else,” she said.

Gavin assured the MD is compliant with the minimum amount of parking stalls required at the site and no additional stalls would be needed for the new ATCO trailer.

If deemed necessary, more staff could also be required to park at another MD facility, such as the current operations site, she suggested.

Planning commissioner Jenn Smith pointed out one of the two stalls the new ATCO trailer would occupy is also a barrier-free stall.

The National Building Code 2023 Alberta edition requires at least two stalls be designated as barrier-free for between 11 and 25 parking stalls.

“How do we keep it in compliance making sure we have the required number of barrier-free stalls?” Smith, one of council’s representatives, asked.

Gavin said lines would need to be reconfigured and further suggested a condition could be considered to ensure staff are not utilizing public parking stalls, west of the front doors of the administration building.

“We’ll definitely have to look at our staff parking and, I guess, come up with an alternative plan if it is an ongoing issue and enforcing it on ourselves to make sure that we’re not impacting other use on this site,” she said.

“We can add a condition that we cannot be using certain stalls for staff parking (...). I really think in this situation it’s the best thing we can do and just to reiterate it’s a temporary measure, albeit for a couple of years – hopefully less. That is the intent of this is that it’s not going to be an issue forever, but in the relatively short-term – two years.”

254,Marketing Office Space: 3 Best Practices,https://www.sharplaunch.com/blog/marketing-office-space/,,"Marketing office space for lease requires you to have a clear sense of your target audience and the property-level criteria that impacts their needs.

Your messaging, positioning and marketing strategy need to be perfectly in sync in order to resonate and match the demands of your future tenants. This is the foundation of an effective marketing campaign and will drive how you advertise your office properties.

How to market office space

Marketing office space involves promoting the features and benefits of the space to potential tenants in order to attract them to lease or rent the property. This can be done through various methods such as advertising on CRE listing services, print advertising, real estate agents, networking events, and open houses.

It is important to highlight the unique selling points of the space, such as its location, amenities, and size, and to create high-quality marketing materials, such as photographs and floor plans. Additionally, offering incentives such as discounted rent or customized build-outs can also help to attract potential tenants. Building relationships with local businesses, developers and other stakeholders can also be helpful in finding and retaining tenants.

Below are three key best practices to consider when marketing your office space for lease:

1. Organize All Essential Content

Property Description

An effective property description helps tell the story of your property, the location, amenities and other relevant details to help prospects get a summary of key information they need. Make sure to highlight overall building, key features, the location of the property, and its proximity to area amenities.

Building Specifications

For potential tenants looking for office space, building specifications and health standards are absolutely critical and can be a key advantage to referenced throughout the leasing process.

Specific building specifications to include:

Column spacing

Internet connectivity

HVAC systems

Car parking

Onsite Amenities and Tenant Services

The more information you provide, the better. Potential tenants often view several similar properties that may meet their needs, by listing all the amenities, you allow them to compare all the advantages and facilities available easily. This may include listing the following:

Bicycle storage

Conference center

Fitness center

Restaurants or cafes

Upgrades or recent renovations

Security services

Janitorial services

Professional Photography

When it comes to viewing a slew of potential properties online, the right kind of photography can ensure your office space makes it to a prospective tenantâs shortlist.

As previously mentioned, potential tenants will have eyes on several similar properties, so a high-quality photography will help highlight the spaceâs best facets and illustrate any noteworthy features.

Using a mobile phone to take a few shots wonât cut it though, hire a professional photographer who can expertly capture your propertyâs best angles.

Quality images like these are evergreen and can be used over and over in marketing materials.

Video Content

Even professional photography can only get you so far. Video can help bridge the gap between a digital and a physical visit to the property. Aerial drone footage will emphasize location and layout, while interior videos can show how the facility is configured.

ï»¿

Arena Tower Film by Kilograph

Location Maps

Location is everything and should be communicated front and center.

For example, a shipping company would want to know if a property is located near a highway, as this would benefit transit times.

Companies may also want to take note of a propertyâs proximity to residential neighborhoods, where staff could reside. Be sure to paint a complete picture of the surrounding area using a custom map, including points of interest such as:

Local restaurants

Cafes and bars

Gyms and fitness centers

Metro stations

Access to major transportation

Floor Plans & Test Fit Plans

Office tenants want to understand the visual layout of all available spaces, including the square footage, floor number, suite number, rent type and lease terms.

All these details should be neatly packaged in a downloadable PDF as floor plans and possible fit plans.

Building Certifications

If the property has received a building certification, list them on your description and advertise them to the appropriate audience. This can be a major selling point to the right prospective tenant if you properly promote the property in a place they will see it.

Here are a few of the green building certifications currently available:

LEED

Energy Star

BREEAM

Green Globes

Living Building Challenge

National Green Building Standard

GreenGuard

WELL Building Standard

NABERS

Green Star

CASBEE

Team Members

An opportunity to showcase your expertise, share vital information about your office real estate company and put a face to the name.

Here you can detail your experience working with tenants landlords and the solutions you offer to various clientele.

Existing Tenants

Your existing tenant base is one of the most vital tools you can leverage to build confidence in new tenants.

Social proof gives you instant recognition, instilling a level of trust in just a few words. Put your existing tenants on display, and similar businesses will follow.

Not only does like attract like, but it can also be seen as advantageous for companies to be in the same office space to create some synergy.

2. Create Key Marketing Assets

Office property investors and tenants must assess several different opportunities at once against dozens of crucial criteria. Naturally, there is a lot to consider.

Potential clients can weigh their options more efficiently by viewing a document that includes key lease information in a digestible format.

Critical marketing assets like these should be viewable and downloadable on your commercial real estate websites, because interested parties may lose interest or find it frustrating to have to dig for basic information.

Here is the most vital marketing information you should include when leasing an office space:

Property Website

A dedicated property website highlights the property details, location, configuration, and other key elements for someone who might be evaluating multiple locations at the same time. Information should be clearly presented and easy to reference.

Having branded promotional items on-hand during your property tour is an effective way to gain an edge and make your property tours memorable.

3. Promote Your Office Space

Once your office space website is ready, the next phase requires the preparation of digital, print and email-based marketing materials to promote the property. These marketing campaign efforts will help to expand your visibility, beyond your existing audience and help bolster your brokers ability to find prospective clients.

Where is the best place to advertise an office space for lease?

There are many effective channels to create buzz, the ones listed below are considered the most effective:

Display on Your Company Website

Individual property sites are a small piece of a larger ecosystem.

Your companyâs digital footprint must always be interlinked, meaning your listing website should always link back to the main company website, where all properties are aggregated and on display. On the main website, you can highlight different properties based on the unique visitorâs interests.

By using an interactive property search engine, site visitors can filter properties by location, property types, availability and more.

This tool also helps to highlight related office spaces, ensuring your relevant properties do not go unnoticed.

Send Your Own Email Campaigns

Leverage your database by sending out emails that notify potential tenants when an office space is available for lease.

Using email templates, you can easily slot in the relevant information quickly to save on time, adding the different properties and locations in your roster. To turn your database into deals, you should consider the following when sending out an email campaign:

Get Listed on CRE Portals

Listing your property on mainstream commercial real estate listing websites is a no brainer. It would be best if you also considered putting your office space onto regional market sites that focus on geography and websites that cater specifically to office properties.

Promote on Social Media

A strong social media presence is essential for prospects, as it is another vehicle to instill trust and push out relevant information. This, however, should be taken with a pinch of salt. Time spent on social media channels should correspond to their investment return; donât overextend yourself in this department.

239,Maximize Your Growth Opportunities with Flexible Business ...,https://unitedco.com.au/office-space-for-lease-unlock-your-business-potential/,,"A business office space refers to a commercial property available for rent to businesses or individuals for conducting office-related activities. This includes a designated area within a building or complex, offering a working environment with amenities such as desks, chairs, and an internet connection. In addition, shared facilities like conference rooms, kitchens, or parking spaces may be included.

Moreover, leasing space in a business office allows tenants to establish a professional presence without the long-term commitment and financial investment associated with purchasing a property. Here, we examine the benefits of leasing a flexible business office space and how it can maximize your growth opportunities.

Who can lease a flexible business office space?

Various groups and individuals can rent a flexible business offices space, including:

Small and medium-sized businesses

Companies that need physical offices to carry out their operations and accommodate their employees often lease office spaces. This includes small companies, professional service firms, creative companies, tech companies, and more.

Freelancers and independent professionals

Individuals who work independently or as freelancers may choose to lease a casual or private office to separate their work from their personal life, gain access to amenities, and create a more professional environment.

Remote teams and satellite offices

Organizations with remote teams or those looking to find somewhere to establish a satellite office in a different location may opt to rent office spaces to provide a main working space for their employees.

Branches and subsidiary companies

Companies growing their operations or establishing branches or subsidiaries in new areas may lease or rent out office spaces to set up a first level of physical presence and support local operations.

Non-profit organizations

Non-profit organizations often rent offices to manage their administrative tasks, coordinate events, and cater for collaborations.

Professional service providers

Lawyers, financial advisers, consultants, and other professionals who offer services to clients often rent private office spaces to meet with clients, conduct meetings, and maintain a professional image.

It is important to note that the specific needs of leasing offices can vary due to the nature of the business or individual needs.

Why should you consider a flexible business office space?

There are several reasons why individuals or businesses choose to lease offices. Flexible office leasing can be helpful for many reasons, and many can often choose between casual office spaces or private offices.

Flexibility

Leasing an office provides flexibility in terms of the duration of use. Lease terms can be suited to address short-term or long-term needs, allowing businesses to adapt to changing circumstances or easily relocate if necessary.

Cost-effectiveness

Leasing an office often requires a lower upfront financial investment compared to buying a property. It allows businesses to allocate their capital to other essential areas such as operations, marketing, or hiring.

Access to amenities and services

Many leased offices come equipped with amenities and services such as internet connectivity, utilities, maintenance, and security. These shared resources are often more cost-effective than setting them up independently.

Professional image

Having a front lobby or dedicated office space can enhance a company’s professional image and credibility. It provides a formal environment for meetings with clients, partners, and employees, giving the impression of stability and reliability.

Networking

Leased offices often house multiple businesses, offices or professionals located in the same building, floor, or complex. This can lead to networking, collaboration, and potential business partnerships.

Location advantages

Leasing offices allows businesses to establish a presence in desirable locations or find offices that may be otherwise unaffordable or inaccessible for purchasing. To rent a new office and find a space in a prime location, can attract clients, and employees, and contribute to the overall success of the business.

Focus on core activities

By leasing an office, businesses can decide the responsibility of property management and upkeep of private offices to the owner or property management company. This allows the business to focus more time on its core activities and everyday operations.

Each business or individual needs to evaluate and address their specific needs and circumstances to determine if leasing an office aligns with their goals and budget.

How long are most office leasing agreements?

The duration of office space for lease can vary depending on the lease level-specific agreement between the landlord and tenant. However, when it comes to offices and leasing, some common agreement terms are often seen in the commercial real estate industry, in Melbourne.

Typically, office leasing can range from as short as one year to as long as ten years or more. The most common lease terms for offices are usually between three to five years, depending on the office spaces required. Private office space is a popular option.

Short-term office leasing, such as those with a duration of one to two years, offers greater flexibility to tenants who may have uncertain or ever-changing space requirements. These shorter leases are often preferred by startups, small businesses, or those who are testing a new market or concept.

Moreover, long-term leases, on the other hand, provide stability and security for both the landlord and tenant. They are commonly chosen by established businesses looking for a stable location and the potential for cost savings through agreed rates.

In addition to offering the initial term, some agreements may include options for renewal or expansion, allowing tenants to extend their terms or increase their space as their needs evolve.

It’s worth noting that office and leasing terms can be negotiated between the parties involved, and the specific terms and conditions of office terms can vary widely depending on factors such as market conditions, location, property type, and individual circumstances.

How to find the right Melbourne Office Space to Lease

The benefit of flexible business office space for your growth opportunities

Here are some benefits of a flexible business office space for your growing company.

Scalability

Office leasing allows businesses to scale their operations as they grow. They can start with small offices and expand as needed to private offices, without the constraints of property ownership. This type of flexibility allows businesses to adapt to changing demands. It also accommodates a growing number of employees.

Professional Image

An empty private office provides a professional environment for conducting business activities, meeting clients, and hosting meetings. A well-maintained and properly equipped private office can enhance a business’s image, reputation, and professionalism. This can be great for attracting clients, partners, and top talent.

Centralized Operations

Office leasing provides a centralized location for a team of employees to work together, fostering collaboration, communication, and connectivity. This can lead to better productivity and efficiency, especially for businesses that rely on in-person interactions or need a physical space for certain operations.

Access to Amenities and Services

Many leased offices and spaces come with shared amenities and services, such as reception areas, meeting rooms, kitchen appliances, and parking. These resources are often cost-effective compared to setting them up independently. Access to this can improve the overall convenience of the workspace.

Networking Opportunities

Leased office spaces often house multiple businesses or professionals within the same building or complex. This proximity can facilitate networking opportunities, collaboration, and potential partnerships. Interacting with other tenants or businesses in the same location can lead to valuable connections, knowledge sharing, and business growth opportunities.

Prime Location

Office leasing allows businesses to establish a presence in sought after locations that may be otherwise unaffordable or inaccessible for property ownership. New office space in a prime area can enhance visibility, accessibility, and the perception of the business, which can help its growth and success.

Cost Effective

Leasing an office generally requires a lower level of upfront investment compared to buying a property. It allows businesses to allocate their financial resources to other critical areas, such as marketing, hiring, or product development. Additionally, office leasing often offers predictable monthly bills, as the costs of property maintenance and repairs are the responsibility of the landlord.

It’s important for companies to carefully consider their specific needs, growth plans, and financial situation when deciding to lease an office building. Conducting thorough research, evaluating agreements, and considering future needs can help businesses make informed decisions that support their goals.

What should I look for in a business office space?

When searching for an office space for lease, there are several factors to consider. Here are some key aspects to look for when it comes to office leasing:

Location of office space for lease

Evaluate the location’s accessibility, distance to transport, amenities, and its suitability for your business needs. Consider a variety of factors such as the target market, competition, and convenience for employees and clients.

Size and Layout

Assess the size of the office and its layout to ensure it can work for your current and future needs. Consider factors like the number of employees, workspace requirements, meeting rooms, storage areas, and any infrastructure or equipment you may require for your offices.

Lease Terms and Flexibility

Carefully review the agreement, including lease duration, renewal options, rental rates, and any extra costs or obligations. Look for flexibility in case your business needs change during the overall term.

Amenities and Services

Consider the available amenities and services such as parking facilities, internet connectivity, security systems, maintenance support, shared common areas, and access to conference rooms or other facilities that may be crucial for your operations.

Infrastructure and Technology

Evaluate the infrastructure of the office, including electrical, HVAC systems, and IT infrastructure. Ensure that the new office area can accommodate your tech requirements and support efficient and dependable operations.

Safety and Security

Assess the full level of safety measures and security features of the building or complex, such as surveillance systems, access controls, fire safety, and emergency procedures. It’s important to prioritize the well-being of your employees and assets.

Scalability and Growth Potential

Consider whether the office allows for future expansion or flexibility to adjust the floor space according to your business growth. This can help avoid the need for frequent relocations and disruptions.

Parking and Accessibility of office space for lease

Assess the availability of parking spaces for employees and visitors. Consider accessibility for individuals with disabilities and the convenience of public transportation options.

Budget and Financial Considerations

Furthermore, determine whether the office leasing fits within your budget and consider any additional costs such as utilities, maintenance fees, and taxes. Ensure that the financial commitment aligns with your business’s financial capabilities.

Reputation and Landlord/Property Management

Research the reputation of the landlord or property management company. Read reviews or talk to current tenants to gauge their responsiveness, reliability, and level of support.

Above all, by considering these factors, you can make an informed decision about finding one that aligns with your business’s needs, goals, and budget. It’s often helpful to visit multiple potential office spaces, ask questions, and seek professional advice when necessary.

Seven-Mile Route Will Restore Waterfront Access for Bronxites and Connect Van Cortlandt Park to Randall’s Island with Public Open Space and Bike Path

Adams Administration’s Nation-Leading Work to Reconnect Communities Divided by Highways Comes to Major Deegan Expressway, Which Separated Bronxites From Harlem River Nearly a Century Ago

NEW YORK – New York City Mayor Eric Adams, New York City Department of Transportation (DOT) Commissioner Ydanis Rodriguez, New York City Department of Parks & Recreation (NYC Parks) Commissioner Sue Donoghue, and New York City Economic Development Corporation President and CEO Andrew Kimball today announced a groundbreaking plan to deliver a critical public space to a community too often left behind by expanding the Harlem River Greenway to the Bronx.

Greenways are shared, linear spaces on public land, available for recreational uses like cycling, running, or walking. Beginning on April 18, 2023, the Adams administration will conduct public engagement and craft a plan for the new greenway. The route will span seven miles, connecting Randall’s Island at the southern tip of the Bronx to Van Cortlandt Park in the north, with continuous cycling and walking, including a critical north-south bike commuting corridor. The project represents a major new front in the administration’s nation-leading effort to reconnect communities divided by highways, focusing on the Major Deegan Expressway, which has cut off Bronxites’ access to the Harlem River waterfront since the 1930s.

“This administration continues to deliver for all five boroughs, and expanding the Harlem River Greenway to the Bronx is a huge win for equity and justice,” said Mayor Adams. “Our administration is leading the way in undoing the devastation caused by highways like the Cross-Bronx Expressway, the BQE, and now the Deegan — reversing the devastation left by others in communities of color. Greenways help us move forward while righting the wrongs of the past, give people a place where they can exercise and breathe freely, and create a sense of community by bringing people together. That’s what the Bronx deserves and what this project will deliver.”

“Historic disinvestment and highway construction has, for decades, severed Bronxites’ connection to their waterfront. This administration is centering equity in all its work — and that means ensuring communities in the Bronx have safe cycling connections and pedestrian access to and along the Harlem River shoreline, one of the city’s most beautiful natural landscapes,” said DOT Commissioner Rodriguez. “We look forward to working with Bronxites and our sister agencies in shaping this project as we continue work on our larger greenway development plans.”

“We believe that all New Yorkers deserve access to our city’s beautiful public parkland, and greenways often serve as critical connectors to our parks, waterfronts, and greenspaces,” said NYC Parks Commissioner Donoghue. “We are excited to work with our sister agencies to expand the city’s greenway network — including and especially in the outer boroughs — so we can strengthen the connections between parks and increase recreational opportunities for all New Yorkers.”

“Access to green and open spaces and safe biking infrastructure is vital to New Yorkers’ quality of life, and the Bronx Harlem River Greenway is a critical component to better connecting New Yorkers to our waterfront,” said NYCEDC President and CEO Kimball. “The Bronx Harlem River Greenway aligns with NYCEDC’s commitment to driving our city’s economic vitality and making New York City an even better place to live, work, and play. I look forward to working with Mayor Adams, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Parks & Recreation, and the community to make this vision a reality.”

The expanded Harlem River Greenway will restore Bronxites’ access to the waterfront with a network of off-street, multi-use, shared paths along the waterfront, as well as on-street bicycle facilities that will allow for safe and convenient travel along and around the river. The administration will identify high-priority, quick-build street redesigns to support larger projects, and the implementation plan developed through community engagement will include both short-term and long-term projects on identified preferred routes. Short-term projects will include the installation of markings, signs, and limited concrete work on city streets. Long-term projects will include more complex improvements to be constructed as future capital projects.

The community engagement process, launching next month, will outline a comprehensive strategy to create a continuous and accessible path along this corridor. At this first round of public workshops — with one workshop for each of the three segments of the planned greenway — DOT planners will discuss existing conditions along the waterfront and seek input from residents on how they would like to use this space through bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure upgrades. The agency will follow up with an additional round of public workshops this fall before an implementation plan will be published in 2024. DOT will also engage community members at pop-up events throughout the spring and summer, including at “Bike the Block” and “Car-Free Earth Day” events.

Community outreach will be conducted in partnership with the Bronx and Harlem River Urban Waters Federal Partnership and the New York-New Jersey Harbor and Estuary Program, which work to help reconnect community residents to their waterways. DOT is also collaborating with the Bronx Center for Environmental Quality and the Harlem River Working Group, which have long advocated for improving environmental quality and access to and along the Harlem River.

The expansion of the Harlem River Greenway follows the Adams administration’s receipt of a $7.25 million federal grant award to plan the city’s next generation of greenways, with a focus on expanding the network to historically underserved communities.

“Expanding equity of waterfront access is a key goal of our Comprehensive Waterfront Plan,” said New York City Department of City Planning Executive Director Edith Hsu-Chen. “This much-needed greenway extension will link more New Yorkers with their shoreline and lead to a healthier, more connected city for all.”

“I proudly helped secure the historic federal RAISE grant to expand the biking and walking greenway network across the five boroughs. The funding creates exciting new green spaces, like the expansion of the Harlem River Greenway to the Bronx, to extend access to affordable transportation for pedestrians and cyclists in underserved communities,” said U.S. Senator Charles Schumer. “This plan to restore waterfront access and provide public space for Bronxites shows Mayor Adams’s commitment to expand the greenway network to make New York City safer, cleaner, greener, and more healthy for all.”

“I am proud to have recently helped secure federal funds to plan the expansion of greenways throughout New York City, and I applaud the Adams administration for prioritizing the expansion of the Harlem River Greenway,” said U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. “Today’s announcement represents an important step towards addressing the harm caused by the Major Deegan Expressway, while also ensuring greater access and safety for pedestrians and cyclists along the waterfront. I look forward to the results of the community engagement process and will continue to fight for this important project at the federal level.”

“The Harlem River Greenway is a tremendous priority project that will bring new open space, waterfront access, and a renewed seawall to the communities across New York City, from East Harlem to Inwood to the Bronx,” said U.S. Representative Adriano Espaillat. “During my inaugural environmental justice tour, the need to revitalize the Harlem River Greenway was emphasized by every level of government and all members of the EPA’s Bronx and Harlem River Federal partnership program. I was proud to help secure $7.25 million to supercharge the Harlem River Greenway and am grateful to Mayor Adams and DOT Commissioner Rodriguez for moving forward on an equity project that will benefit the quality of life of New York City residents, families, and visitors for years to come.”

“We can never go back in time to reverse the systemic harm caused by the construction of highways that divided entire communities — like the Bronx — and forever changed their trajectory,” said U.S. Representative Ritchie Torres. “But we can be intentional about how we move forward to reconnect these communities in a way that enriches their surroundings, creates vital greenspaces, and improves the quality of life for people who live there. I’m encouraged to see a plan from the city moving forward that promises to provide new and improved access to the waterfront for Bronxites for the first time in decades while offering safe and convenient recreational and transportation opportunities. My gratitude to all involved for making it happen.”

“The Harlem River Greenway will provide the Bronx with long-overdue and much-needed access to the waterfront and outdoor recreational space,” said New York State Senator Jose Serrano Jr. “This seven-mile project will encourage outdoor physical activity, which can improve the health and well-being of a community that has long dealt with negative health disparities. Along with improving access to our waterfront, the greenway will build a direct connection from Randall’s Island and the South Bronx to the urban forest in Van Cortlandt Park in the northwest Bronx. Many thanks to Mayor Adams, NYC DOT, NYC Parks, and all of the government agencies and community partners for their work on this issue.”

“I am thrilled that the mayor is announcing plans to expand the Harlem River Greenway to the Bronx,” said New York State Senator Gustavo Rivera. “For decades, Bronxites could not access the Harlem River waterfront as a result of racist policies and highway construction that impeded my community from enjoying this natural space. This groundbreaking effort will rectify this injustice by involving our community to create an environmentally friendly recreational space that my neighbors will thoroughly enjoy.”

“It is of the utmost importance that we continue to expand access to green space in the Bronx, and I am very excited about launching the community engagement process for the Harlem River Greenway expansion,” said New York State Assemblymember Jeffrey Dinowitz. “This will help more New Yorkers enjoy Van Cortlandt Park, which I believe is the best park in all of New York, and I am grateful to the leadership of Mayor Adams, Commissioners Rodriguez and Donahue, and Mr. Kimball in getting this project started.”

“Greenspace is key to our health, our quality of life, our environment, and the vibrancy of our neighborhoods. Mayor Adams has a five-borough agenda to deliver those benefits to every corner of our city,” said New York State Assemblymember Jenifer Rajkumar. “Already the mayor has increased park construction projects by 142 percent, and now he continues this record with the Harlem River Greenway expansion. These seven new miles of greenspace will restore waterfront access to Bronxites after almost a century, circumventing the barrier created by the Major Deegan Expressway. The mayor is also committed to a project that meets the needs and wants of the people, incorporating comprehensive community input. I look forward to partnering with him to make New York City the greenest it has been in the modern era.”

“The expansion of the Harlem River Greenway will reconnect Bronx communities which have been long divided and unfairly denied easier and safe access to the Harlem River waterfront,” said New York State Assemblymember John Zaccaro, Jr. “It is vital that projects such as this continue and that the City of New York serve as a model for how municipalities across our country can address the negative impact of communities divided by highways and collaboratively work to implement solutions. I want to thank Mayor Eric Adams and his administration for their work championing this important project.”

“The plan to expand the Harlem River Greenway into the Bronx is long overdue,” said New York City Council Deputy Speaker Diana Ayala. “Bronx residents for far too long have been barred from community access to the waterfront; I’m glad that this plan aims to finally address that.”

“Greenways are among New York’s most valuable public spaces,” said New York City Council Majority Whip Selvena N. Brooks-Powers, chair, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. “Expanding the Harlem River Greenway to the Bronx is a rejection of the legacy of racist urban planning that defined New York for generations. I was proud to co-prime sponsor legislation to create a master plan for the city’s greenways and support increased connectivity and accessibility for our greenway network citywide. I celebrate this administration’s commitment to extending and expanding this network, especially to underserved communities in the outer boroughs.”

“The North Bronx has long desired the expansion of the greenway and the exceptional benefits that comes with it,” said New York City Councilmember Eric Dinowitz. “This project has my full support, and I am thrilled that the Adams Administration is making this a priority. The greenway serves as a vital connection between neighborhoods, providing a safe and accessible route for pedestrians and cyclists alike. Not only will the expansion of the greenway provide more opportunities for outdoor recreation, but it will also have a positive impact on the environment and put the Bronx on the map as a tourist destination. We have long advocated for this initiative, and I look forward to seeing its positive impact on the community and the environment.”

“I am pleased with the city’s investment in expanding the Harlem River Greenway to community members of the Bronx,” said New York City Councilmember Althea Stevens. “In addition to reconnecting our communities, it is an imperative solution in working towards alleviating daily transportation limitations for community members who reside in districts that are historically known to be transportation deserts. I’m glad to hear that the city will be utilizing community feedback, as partnership is important to ensure the rollout is effective and beneficial to the surrounding community.”

“Improving bicycle and pedestrian access to the Harlem River will help connect Bronx residents to this vital public waterway,” said Robert Pirani, director, New York-New Jersey Harbor and Estuary Program. “This is a top priority for the Bronx and Harlem Urban Waters Federal Partnership, and we are so grateful for the mayor’s initiative. Thanks to funding provided by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, we will be collaborating with our partners at the New York City Department of Transportation and the Harlem River Working Group to provide small grants for community-led programs to bring the Bronx to their waterfront.”

“Green spaces are so essential to the health and well-being of New Yorkers, and there are far too many Bronxites who do not have easy access to a park or greenway right now,” said Meisha Ross Porter, president and CEO, Bronx Community Foundation. “I thank Mayor Adams for committing to this major investment in the Bronx Greenway today, which will help make all of us healthier and wealthier in the coming years. The Bronx Greenway will help connect Bronx residents to needed open space and to the city’s larger parks system. Today, we are starting to fix some of the most glaring disparities in access to parks and green spaces that exist in our city.”

“Since its inception, the Harlem River Working Group has been led by community members working improve access to the Bronx and Manhattan side of the Harlem River and develop the Harlem and Putnam River Greenways,” said Chauncy Young, coordinator, Harlem River Working Group. “The city’s first greenway plan that included the Harlem River Greenway was developed under Mayor David Dinkins and Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer in 1993. Today, we can finally make those dreams a reality, and I commend Representatives Adriano Espaillat and Ritchie Torres for their unwavering support to secure $7 million for the New York City greenway expansion, and Mayor Adams and Commissioner Rodriquez for prioritizing this environmental justice project once and for all.”

“Over the course of decades, the investment in the Bronx River Greenway has created acres of new parkland and invaluable connections between neighborhoods that were separated for so long,” said Siddharth Motwani, Bronx River Greenway coordinator, Bronx River Alliance. “Focusing on the Harlem River Greenway is an opportunity for the city to bring these same benefits to communities around the Harlem River. We applaud this investment and look forward to the development of accessible waterfront green spaces for the west Bronx.”

“The Randall’s Island Park Alliance is thrilled to learn of plans for increased connections to the island’s Bronx neighbors,” said Deborah Maher, president, Randall’s Island Park Alliance. “An expanded Harlem River Greenway will provide crucial commuting and recreational resources for New Yorkers and enable even more visitors to enjoy the park's resources.”

“Brooklyn Greenway Initiative is the coordinating organization of the New York City Greenways Coalition that has advanced the citywide cause of this vital open space and active transportation infrastructure,” said Hunter Armstrong, executive director, Brooklyn Greenway Initiative. “In Brooklyn, we know how valuable it was when the New York City Department of Transportation developed the 2012 implementation plan for the Brooklyn Waterfront Greenway. Having this plan in place has enabled the City of New York to make steady progress towards building out the greenway in our borough. The launch of the Harlem River Greenway plan is a significant and tangible win for the residents of the Bronx, and the other communities that the coalition supports, and hopefully, a sign of additional implementation studies to come.”

“RPA is very pleased to see New York City planning for better greenways in the Bronx and expanding access to the Harlem River waterfront,” said Tiffany-Ann Taylor, vice president for transportation, Regional Plan Association (RPA). “The more interconnected and accessible we can make New York City’s walking, running, and biking network, the healthier and greener our city will become. We look forward to working with NYC DOT during the planning process to make sure the needs of the local neighborhoods and citywide goals are reflected in the project.”

“Projects like these are sorely needed here in the Bronx, where the majority of households do not own vehicles, but where truly safe biking and walking routes are scarce due to wide arterial roadways that divide communities and cut off access to green space,” said Renae Reynolds, executive director, Tri-State Transportation Campaign. “Much like the extremely popular Hudson River Greenway in Manhattan and other waterfront greenways in Brooklyn and Queens, the Harlem River Greenway will be a public ‘front yard’ for Bronxites, reconnecting communities and offering a practical, sustainable, and low-stress way for people to get around the city. We look forward to seeing the ideas local residents have for how to make this space their own.”

“We’re thrilled at the news that the Adams administration will begin important work to expand the Harlem River Greenway,” said Eric McClure, executive director, StreetsPAC. “We know firsthand how hard Bronx-based advocates have worked to make this a reality, and it’s exciting to see their dedication coming to fruition. The expansion of the greenway will provide greatly enhanced recreational opportunities for Bronx residents and will surely lead to robust growth in bike commuting. We’re proud that we helped advocate for resources to expand the greenway network citywide.”

“The mayor’s announcement is great news for the Bronx and the city’s greenway network,” said Jon Orcutt, director of advocacy, Bike New York. “Thanks to the Adams administration for committing new funding to greenway upgrades and new projects, for pursuing the federal funding leading to today’s announcement, and for last year’s support for legislation requiring a regularly updated city greenway plan, as well as continued progress on projects like the East Midtown Greenway.”

“This is great news for Bronxites, who will get access to more green spaces and a critical new bike path that will expand their transportation options,” said Patrick Knoth, senior strategy operations manager of Citi Bike, Lyft. “Since the pandemic, we’ve seen an explosion in recreational Citi Biking along our waterfront, and we know this expansion will prove just as popular. We want to extend our gratitude to Mayor Adams and his team for supporting transformational projects like this that help us make Citi Biking safer, easier, and more fun for everyone.”

484,Meta trims Lagos office space after layoffs,https://nairametrics.com/2024/06/14/meta-trims-lagos-office-space-after-layoffs/,1 час назад,"Meta, the company behind Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, is trimming down its office space in Lagos.

This follows workforce reductions in mid-2023 that impacted at least 35 Nigerian employees, including the entire engineering team.

Per a TechCabal report, the social media giant said the move is part of a regular review process to optimize its real estate footprint.

The company said it plans to transition to a desk-sharing model for employees who primarily work remotely.

What Meta is saying

While Meta is downplaying the reduction of its office space, it confirms it is no longer using engineers in Nigeria for its operations.

“Engineers continue to serve the region from a number of our global engineering hubs outside of Nigeria,” a company spokesperson told TechCabal via email.

“We regularly review our office spaces to ensure they suit the needs of the business, and the office in Nigeria is no different.

“As we shrink our real estate footprint, we’re transitioning to desk sharing for people who already spend most of their time outside the office,” the company added.

The reduction in team size has prompted the social media giant to begin renegotiating its tenancy agreement for its office space in the 15-story Kings Tower building in Ikoyi, Lagos.

A key part of that renegotiation will be to reduce its office space. Per one publication, Kings Tower has an asking price of $800/sqm/per annum.

Meta’s mixed signals in Nigeria

Although Meta denies any notion of scaling back, this move represents a significant shift for a company that has consistently invested in Nigeria and emphasized its commitment to the West African nation.

In March 2024, Nick Clegg, Meta’s President of Global Affairs, visited Nigeria and announced the introduction of monetization opportunities for creators starting in Q3 2024.

During his visit, he highlighted the global recognition Nigerian creators have achieved using Meta’s platforms.

According to Statista, there are an estimated 43 million Facebook users in Nigeria.

However, Meta lumps African revenue into its “Rest of World” category, making it difficult to assess its performance in Nigeria specifically.

Meta is not the only big tech company making operational changes in Nigeria. Microsoft recently shuttered its African Development Centre and cut over 100 engineering jobs in May 2024.

While the company insists on maintaining a presence in Nigeria, Kenya was chosen for a multi-billion dollar investment in data centres.

What you should know

Before it was officially opened in 2022, Facebook announced the plan to open a Lagos office in September 2020, saying it was part of its ongoing investments in Africa.

According to the company, the office was to be home to several teams across its business including Sales, Partnerships, Policy and Communications. It was also the first office on the continent with a team of engineers.

The opening of the office followed the 2018 opening of NG_Hub, its first community hub space in Africa in partnership with CcHub, and the 2019 opening of its Small Business Group (SBG) Operations Centre in Lagos, in partnership with Teleperformance.",announced new office plans
396,Methods of Payment,https://www.trade.gov/methods-payment,,"Don’t lose potential business to competitors by overlooking different payment options which could be attractive to your international buyer. Explore several payment methods and find the one best suited to your needs.

Many American businesses new to selling U.S. products overseas expect or prefer to be paid in full in advance. While there is zero risk of non-payment if you do business this way, you risk losing business by overlooking competitors willing to offer buyers better payment options. Consider more attractive payment methods as outlined in this article and accompanying videos.

Methods of Payment

To succeed in today’s global marketplace and win sales against foreign competitors, exporters must offer their customers attractive sales terms supported by the appropriate payment methods. Because getting paid in full and on time is the ultimate goal for each export sale, an appropriate payment method must be chosen carefully to minimize the payment risk while also accommodating the needs of the buyer. As shown in figure 1, there are five primary methods of payment for international transactions. During or before contract negotiations, you should consider which method in the figure is mutually desirable for you and your customer.

Key Points

International trade presents a spectrum of risk, which causes uncertainty over the timing of payments between the exporter (seller) and importer (foreign buyer).

For exporters, any sale is a gift until payment is received.

Therefore, exporters want to receive payment as soon as possible, preferably as soon as an order is placed or before the goods are sent to the importer.

For importers, any payment is a donation until the goods are received.

Therefore, importers want to receive the goods as soon as possible but to delay payment as long as possible, preferably until after the goods are resold to generate enough income to pay the exporter.

Cash-in-Advance

With cash-in-advance payment terms, an exporter can avoid credit risk because payment is received before the ownership of the goods is transferred. For international sales, wire transfers and credit cards are the most commonly used cash-in-advance options available to exporters. With the advancement of the Internet, escrow services are becoming another cash-in-advance option for small export transactions. However, requiring payment in advance is the least attractive option for the buyer, because it creates unfavorable cash flow. Foreign buyers are also concerned that the goods may not be sent if payment is made in advance. Thus, exporters who insist on this payment method as their sole manner of doing business may lose to competitors who offer more attractive payment terms. Learn more about Cash-in-Advance.

Letters of Credit

Letters of credit (LCs) are one of the most secure instruments available to international traders. An LC is a commitment by a bank on behalf of the buyer that payment will be made to the exporter, provided that the terms and conditions stated in the LC have been met, as verified through the presentation of all required documents. The buyer establishes credit and pays his or her bank to render this service. An LC is useful when reliable credit information about a foreign buyer is difficult to obtain, but the exporter is satisfied with the creditworthiness of the buyer’s foreign bank. An LC also protects the buyer since no payment obligation arises until the goods have been shipped as promised. Learn more about Letters of Credit.

Documentary Collections

A documentary collection (D/C) is a transaction whereby the exporter entrusts the collection of the payment for a sale to its bank (remitting bank), which sends the documents that its buyer needs to the importer’s bank (collecting bank), with instructions to release the documents to the buyer for payment. Funds are received from the importer and remitted to the exporter through the banks involved in the collection in exchange for those documents. D/Cs involve using a draft that requires the importer to pay the face amount either at sight (document against payment) or on a specified date (document against acceptance). The collection letter gives instructions that specify the documents required for the transfer of title to the goods. Although banks do act as facilitators for their clients, D/Cs offer no verification process and limited recourse in the event of non-payment. D/Cs are generally less expensive than LCs. Learn more about Documentary Collections.

Open Account

An open account transaction is a sale where the goods are shipped and delivered before payment is due, which in international sales is typically in 30, 60 or 90 days. Obviously, this is one of the most advantageous options to the importer in terms of cash flow and cost, but it is consequently one of the highest risk options for an exporter. Because of intense competition in export markets, foreign buyers often press exporters for open account terms since the extension of credit by the seller to the buyer is more common abroad. Therefore, exporters who are reluctant to extend credit may lose a sale to their competitors. Exporters can offer competitive open account terms while substantially mitigating the risk of non-payment by using one or more of the appropriate trade finance techniques covered later in this Guide. When offering open account terms, the exporter can seek extra protection using export credit insurance.

Consignment

Consignment in international trade is a variation of open account in which payment is sent to the exporter only after the goods have been sold by the foreign distributor to the end customer. An international consignment transaction is based on a contractual arrangement in which the foreign distributor receives, manages, and sells the goods for the exporter who retains title to the goods until they are sold. Clearly, exporting on consignment is very risky as the exporter is not guaranteed any payment and its goods are in a foreign country in the hands of an independent distributor or agent. Consignment helps exporters become more competitive on the basis of better availability and faster delivery of goods. Selling on consignment can also help exporters reduce the direct costs of storing and managing inventory. The key to success in exporting on consignment is to partner with a reputable and trustworthy foreign distributor or a third-party logistics provider. Appropriate insurance should be in place to cover consigned goods in transit or in possession of a foreign distributor as well as to mitigate the risk of non-payment.

246,Minimum Office Space per Person in a Workspace,https://www.axiomworkplaces.com.au/blog/much-office-space-really-need,,"Office space size is a primary consideration when you’re relocating or renewing a commercial lease. The right office area not only helps your employees stay productive and efficient but can support the growth of your business in the future.

If you’re not sure how much office space you really need, here’s what we typically factor in when we’re developing a customised workplace strategy for our clients.

Your organisational strategy

What type of organisation are you? Your physical work environment reflects your brand, intentionally or unintentionally.

The first step to calculating the space you really need is determining how your employees or customers will use the environment. What type of tasks do your employees perform and how often do they spend at their desks each day? How much storage space do they need – physical or digital?

You also need to consider how many meetings take place in your company, how large the meetings are and potential technologies to maximise collaborative efficiency.

Read more: How technology trends are impacting workplace design

Your business objectives

Before you get bogged down in details, it’s important to consider your overall business objectives and the purpose of your workplace relocation or redesign.

Are you hoping to improve staff productivity? Reduce building management costs? Enhance collaboration between teams? Use your office more efficiently? Understanding what you’re looking to achieve will help you determine how much floorspace you’ll need to achieve it.

Your spatial requirements

The Building Code of Australia requires a minimum of 10m2 per person for office workers, but many companies prefer to estimate their spatial requirements at around 12 to 14m2. Organisations that require more enclosed office spaces for client privacy, such as law, psychology or accounting firms, may need to calculate their requirements at 14 to 20m2 per employee.

These figures are based on total floor area and don’t include essential areas such as kitchens, bathrooms, corridors, meeting rooms, mail rooms, communications or utilities rooms. They’re just estimations, so it’s best to talk to a workplace designer to get an accurate estimate before renting or buying new office space.

Read more: Top tips for budgeting an office move

Your future needs

As well as thinking about your current needs, it’s essential to consider the future needs of your business.

The only think we can count on is constant change. Many commercial leases run for three years or more – which is an age in today’s fast paced world.

You’ll need to ensure capacity for additional employees if you’re thinking of expansion or operational consolidation. You should also consider how much office space you’ll need if you downsize, automate workflows, divest or outsource business functions, merge with another company or undergo a restructure where teams will grow or change in size.

The amount of space you need for technology is also likely to change in the future, particularly if you’re planning to move your IT infrastructure into the cloud or relocate your data centre operations offsite. By considering how your business will look in three, five or even 10 years’ time, you’re in a better position to choose a workplace flexible enough to grow and change as your business does. How can you create a workplace flexible enough to accommodate the future?

268,Moving Offices: The Ultimate Checklist,https://www.clickoffices.com/ultimate-moving-office-checklist,,"There are many reasons you may be moving offices. From establishing your own office as a start-up or moving to a bigger space to expand staffing levels and productivity, through to the need to be in a different location or to improve your corporate image. Either way, moving offices marks a key step in the evolution of any business.

Whilst this is an exciting time, it can also be daunting, especially if you are responsible for the process of moving offices. There will be many tasks to complete before you have moved, so it will require careful planning. Through diligent organisation and planning, costs and disruption to your business will be minimised.

To make life a bit simpler, we have compiled the ultimate moving office checklist to help you navigate the process. This list of simple tasks and procedures can provide a useful tool.

Immediately: Give notice and start your moving office checklist

Once you have signed the lease for your new office, you can kick start the process. The first thing you must do is notify your current landlord and give notice.

Consider legal advice: Your lease may be about to expire, but if you are in a situation where you need to break the lease on your current office, seek advice from a property solicitor. They will investigate your options which may include assigning the lease to another tenant or sub-letting. Just know that there may be potential charges involved. Your lawyer will also be able to advise you about staff considerations around your office relocation, such as whether your employment contracts contain a “mobility clause,” which allows you to move to a new location.





Engage stakeholders: According to the Information and Consultation of Employees Regulations 2004, for businesses with more than 50 or more employees, employers should tell staff what is planned, and then listen to and take account of their views. The same rule applies when moving offices. Ensure you have informed any relevant bodies about your planned move, such as trade unions, board members, regulatory bodies and other staff.





Communicate clearly: Engage in an open dialogue with staff about the move, including dates, all relevant details and expectations. Employees may be concerned about issues such as their commute and the cost, the new building and availability of parking and possible restructure of the company or other changes. Explain the reasons for the move, the benefits it will offer your organisation and your vision for your new office. Keep staff informed throughout the process, via regular emails, announcements in meetings or posted notices.





Plan your budget: Before you start drilling down the detail of your office move, consider the costs involved. These include obvious upfront costs, such as the rent, removals and office deposit. However, there are other moving expenses that you will need to account for, such as any lost working days, storage costs if your current and future lease dates do not match up, utility fees and post redirection service. Check if your insurance policy covers you for office moves, so you are covered in the event of any valuables being damaged in transit.





Look at the essential facilities: Look at what is included in contract for your new office space. If you choose a serviced office or co-working space, then many services, such as phone lines, IT, electricals and business rates will be covered. If they are not, look into the facilities you need and the costs involved.

Six to three months before the move: Essential planning

Make use of all the resources available to you and list every task that needs to be completed, no matter how insignificant, along with a timeline of when you expect tasks to happen.

Create a master document: If you are a large organisation, this will require a spreadsheet or moving office checklist. You will need to assign steps and tasks to individuals or teams within your organisation so everyone knows who is responsible for each job when moving offices. Think about the timing involved. If you are a start-up or smaller company, the move could be completed within a day, but if you are responsible for moving a larger team, who have more assets, the move may need to be completed in stages.





Appoint key people: You will need to assign people to different jobs i.e. Your office move or project planning team. Within larger organisations, you will need a senior team member to sign off processes and costs. Consider enlisting people who have different skills and personalities, so you have a blend of organisational and strategic thinkers and problem solvers, alongside people who will help you stay calm to make the process as orderly as possible. Meet regularly with this team to fine tune your office relocation plan.





Plot key dates: When do you need to be out of your current office and into your new one? If there is any time between these two dates, you may need to consider storage options. When looking into this, consider both the location of the storage and the cost of the time you will need items in storage.





List equipment and products and staff: Create an inventory and list everything that needs to be moved and when. This list will need to include all equipment, such as computers, printers and other specialist items, alongside general furniture and paperwork.





Measure up: Measure up your new office space, thinking about furniture design, layouts and positioning of teams. Make scale plans of the new office layout, so you know exactly where everything will be, including all additional furniture. Assign workspaces and talk to staff about any concerns they may have about this, well in advance of the move.





Think about furniture: Office furniture is an important part of creating a productive and efficient working environment. It also gives the right impression to staff and clients about the quality of the service that you offer. Many serviced offices and other spaces will provide all the furniture you may need but if they do not, or you need extra furniture, order it now. Some businesses may choose to employ an office design company, to look after the whole design and refit process. If you need it, they will source new furniture and other relevant equipment.





Ditch unwanted items: When thinking about what you have in the office, take the time to consider items that you no longer need, that may be taking up valuable space, or those that may need to be replaced. Old furniture and office equipment can be recycled and old paperwork can be disposed of properly, with regards to current data protection laws.





Obtain removal company quotes: Get quotes from removals companies and ensure they understand your area of business. Think about whether you will be doing the packing yourselves or whether you wish the removals company to do your packing for you. If you are moving with furniture, you will need to factor this into your removal plans. Get three quotes from different companies and seek recommendations. Book your chosen company as far in advance as possible. This will allow you as much time as possible to liaise with them about what you need and when.





Inform services providers: Every business will need an internet and phone connection and you may employ other services, such as cleaners and security and maintenance staff. These services will need to be informed of the move date. You will also need to inform your utility providers of your moving date. You may wish to transfer your providers to your new office. If you need new security and cleaning services, research your options.





Organise a clean: If a deep clean is part of you existing office’s lease agreement, ensure you have cleaners in place to do this when you have moved out. You may also think about getting your new office clean for when you move in.





Get your contact lists in order: Ensure you have the lists of all your clients, contacts and suppliers in order. Ensure everyone is up to date with when you are moving office and why. Send regular reminders as the move approaches, with all the contact details.





Purchase packing equipment: The equipment that you need for moving will need to be organised . If you are packing yourself, then you will need all types of packing materials, including crates and large cardboard boxes, tape, scissors and bubble wrap for fragile items.





Review your budget: As your moving date approaches, regularly review your relocation budget to ensure you are staying on track. Refer back to your office relocation checklist to ensure that nothing has been overlooked.





Organise security: New security systems for employees will need to be set up, so they can safely access the new office.

One to two weeks to go: Draw up a moving day schedule and start packing

As the day draws nearer, there will be several imminent tasks to tackle before you move offices.

Create a moving day schedule: This should include a breakdown of everything that needs to happen and when. Set clear deadlines, so no one can procrastinate. Key suppliers will also need to be informed about the day that you are moving. Many businesses choose to move on a day where this business is not operating, such as a weekend, to minimise disruption. Distribute all moving instructions to the relevant people.





Think about a skeleton operation: If you are moving on a day that your business is running, think about organising a skeleton operation for when the move is taking place. All phone calls and enquiries should be diverted here whilst the move is underway. Encourage managers to create comprehensive plans for managing workflows within their teams, so deadlines are met.





Start packing: Efficient packing is a major part of office moves to ensure that everything is moved in the correct manner. If you are not using a full packing service, employees should start packing up the non-essential items they are responsible for about a week in advance, including archived paperwork, files and other items. Ensure items are labelled in the correct way, according to direction from your removals company.





Consider confidential paperwork: Think carefully about how items like confidential paperwork will be transported when you are moving offices. Your moving company will be able to advise you about this. Boxes with anti-tamper labels are often used.





Talk to staff: You will need to communicate regularly with your staff about every stage of the process. Recap with them about what will happen on moving day and talk to them about how you can keep business operations running as seamlessly as possible during the move. Make sure all staff are ready to empty their desks and take all their personal belongings with them.





Organise access: Revisit you plans for security and access to your new building. If you cannot actually get into your new office when you arrive, you will face some big delays!





Update office details: Ensure all contact details on business cards, websites, signage and advertising is ready to be updated when you move.

Moving day: Action, stations!

On the big day, this is when all the planning comes into play! When you get into your new office, there are a number of things you will need to think about to get your business up and running smoothly.

Clean up: Do not forget to ensure that your old office has been restored to the condition that it was in before you moved in. You may also wish to enlist cleaners to help you on the day, to remove packaging and ensure your new office is in tip-top condition.





Have a contacts sheet: Include all key contact details on your office relocation checklist sheet for key people, so if moving staff are in separate places, they can be easily contactable.





Test equipment: Test all computers, phones, networks and other electrical equipment to ensure it is working properly. Work with your IT team to ensure that the IT infrastructure is all correctly installed and tested. Ensure any relevant training on the use of the equipment is given to team leaders.





Check conditions: Ensure that you check the condition of the office when you arrive. Take photos if necessary, as evidence.





Buy food and water: If your office relocation is a demanding job, ensure you have plenty of water and fuel on hand to keep people going.





Unpack and sign off: Get items unpacked and in their new homes as swiftly as possible, so employees can relax and get back to work. Ensure representatives of each department are on hand to facilitate the move and sign off jobs as they are completed, making sure everything is in the correct place and undamaged.

After the move: Time to review and celebrate

After weeks of planning and preparation, you are in your new office. Congratulations!

613,Moving Offices? Here's Your Step-by- ...,https://butterflymx.com/blog/office-moving-checklist/,,"Relocating to a new office seems like a hectic process — but it doesn’t have to be. In fact, with a robust office moving checklist, your move can be a breeze. Developing a strong relocation strategy and modernizing your office’s workflow are key elements in preparing for the future of work.

So, if you’re feeling overwhelmed by the prospect of planning an office move, try writing a corporate move checklist. It’ll help streamline the moving process and empower you to focus on running your business.

Read on to learn everything you’ll need for a successful office relocation plan. You’ll explore four safety measures to implement in your new office space. Next, you’ll learn how to best coordinate your team. Finally, you’ll discover seven tasks you should complete before you move in.

In this post, we cover:

What do you need for an office move?

A clear course of action is necessary for a successful office move. Relocating to a new office is a massive undertaking, so it’s important to have a straightforward strategy to make this process as seamless as possible.

With this in mind, you’ll inevitably run into an issue or two during the relocation process. So, having a plan will equip your team with tools to overcome any moving challenge or obstacle.

Pro tip: Create an office space planning guide and ask your team about new equipment requests, workspace preferences, and design suggestions. Get your team involved in these decisions. As a result, you’ll foster innovation and boost employee happiness.

What are some safety tips for moving offices?

While planning when, where, and how things will be moved, it’s also crucial you take safety precautions when relocating. This way, you’ll ensure no one on your team is impacted by an avoidable injury.

Here are four safety guidelines to keep in mind during your office move:

Avoid trip and fall hazards. Moving is bound to be frantic, but it’s important to be mindful of where you’re placing boxes to avoid obstructing walkways. Use proper lifting technique. Remind everyone to lift with their legs, not their backs, when moving heavy objects to avoid injury. Use safety precautions when cleaning. Label all cleaning supplies appropriately and keep employees in the know about potential chemical hazards. Put it all in writing. Write and distribute an office moving checklist to all employees well before moving day.

How should you coordinate a team move to a new office?

Coordinating with your team is one of the most important aspects of moving to a new commercial space. Discuss the logistics of the move with your team so that everyone is on the same page.

Here are the most important details to communicate with your team:

New office location. Send out a notice to every member of your team about the new location so they can begin shipping any packages to the appropriate location.

Send out a notice to every member of your team about the new location so they can begin shipping any packages to the appropriate location. Moving date. Every team member should be made aware of the move-in date and when to report to work at the new location. This is especially important for the employees who are assisting with the move-in process.

Every team member should be made aware of the move-in date and when to report to work at the new location. This is especially important for the employees who are assisting with the move-in process. Employee expectations. List features of the new office and establish a clear code of conduct at the new location.

Pro tip: Invest in a package management solution to streamline deliveries at your new office.

7 things you should do before you move offices

So, you’re ready to start planning your office move, but where do you start? Let’s take a close look at what you should prioritize when developing your office relocation strategy.

Here are seven objectives you should accomplish before you move in:

1. Create an office moving checklist

An office moving checklist will help streamline the moving process. This list should prioritize important tasks and set a general timeline for your move.

Check out our office relocation checklist template to help you stay organized and keep your move uncomplicated.

2. Consider your office move needs

Determine what your relocation needs are and prioritize them accordingly. With this in mind, reflect on what you can improve in your new space.

Consider questions like:

What did your old office space lack?

What improvements can you make to the new space?

How can you increase workplace efficiency with your new office design?

What’s more, transforming your empty office space is the perfect opportunity to modernize your office. Investing in office upgrades will help lower operational costs and improve productivity in your new office space.

3. Choose your moving team

Hire movers and create a task force for a seamless move-in. While doing everything in-house is cheaper, it’ll likely only breed confusion and lost or broken equipment. Furthermore, designate a moving coordinator from your own team to be the point of contact during the moving process.

4. Plan your timeline and schedule

Create a timeline complete with precise deadlines to keep you on track during the move. Stick to this schedule and follow your timeline to make the move less stressful and manage your time more effectively.

5. Create a moving budget

Determining a budget prepares you for every moving expense. However, it’s natural for unexpected costs to pop up during a move. So, have some wiggle room in your budget to accommodate these expenses.

Additionally, include office upgrades and improvements in this budget. Investing in office automation software will help lower operational costs over time and improve business operations in your new office space.

Reach out to your service providers and transfer all utilities to the new office location. As a result, you’ll have a much easier transition to the new location and will immediately have the services you need at the new office.

7. Install a secure access control system

Installing a secure access control system will boost convenience and security at your new office. A complete access control solution secures your team’s assets while also enabling convenient access into and throughout your building. Additionally, the best access control systems are cloud-based, like the ButterflyMX unified access system. This way, you can manage and monitor access at your new office from anywhere.

What’s more, a complete access control system with vehicle readers and windshield stickers empowers you to streamline access if your new office has a gated lot or parking garage.

Moving office is a huge task and can easily become an overwhelming one if you’re ill-prepared. With so many logistical and business factors to consider, we’ve pulled together our top tips covering the key issues that office managers and business owners need to think about before embarking on the dreaded office relocation.

At Yeates, we have the experience, resources and industry knowledge to manage, plan and execute your commercial move successfully with a quality, professional service. If you would like to discuss your needs further or a quote, please contact us here.

1. Plan early and methodically

Let’s get one thing straight, simply ‘getting on with it’ without a plan is a recipe for disaster. Hard work alone is unlikely to result in a successful office move, so take some time to plan early, however large or small your business is. The planning process should begin as soon as possible. You don’t necessarily need to know many details about your move at the beginning of the process, but if you’re aware that it’s happening at some point in the future, it would be wise to start thinking about floor plans and seeking out an experienced office removals company. Once you know how much space you have to work with in your new premises, measure up bulky items such as desks and filing cabinets to help with the floor plans.

2. Find the best removals company for your budget

Picking the right office removals company for your needs within budget may take a little time, but it’s important to ensure that you choose one that makes your move as simple as possible. Ideally you should compare a few options and the quotes they provide, but be wary of simply choosing the cheapest. Find out how they intend to pack, move and transport your items — replacing broken office equipment that has been carelessly handled or transported is a hassle that you could do without. Not only can a decent removals company give you an idea of the costs and methods involved, they can also provide you with invaluable planning advice to give you the perfect head-start.

3. Provide clear and simple communication

Your staff are no doubt busy people with plenty of important work on their plates. Feed them easily-digestible messages that allow them to be kept fully in the loop on the move whilst fulfilling their duties and providing outstanding services to your business and your clients. Try not to overload them with too much information at once, but provide staggered updates and reminders of where you are with the office relocation plans. Consider using simple timeline diagrams or other visual messaging tools to provide memorable points of reference for those who — somewhat inevitably — may not read your emails properly.

Creating a specific email address or subject heading for move-related communications can help staff and anyone else involved, such as the office landlord, to easily identify emails and store them in an ‘Office Move’ email folder if required.

4. Give your staff flexibility

The move may affect different departments in different ways, so listen carefully to questions and concerns from your staff. You’ll need to ensure the move is as stress-free as possible and that it allows staff to do their jobs (and keep your clients happy) with minimal disruption. For example, if you set a fixed date for a department in the business to move over to your new premises, but someone in that department needs to conduct business-critical work on that day, try to find a compromise that prevents both your client and your employee from suffering a meltdown! The knock-on effect from an unnecessarily disruptive office move can have serious consequences for your business if your staff are left feeling unhappy, misled or confused about the timing and reasons for your move. Of course, it’s difficult to keep everyone happy, but a little flexibility will go a long way.

5. Move to your new premises in stages

If the lease of your new office allows, try to simplify your moving-in process by completing it in stages. Or at the very least, you can pack your low priority items in advance — files and equipment that you need to keep but don’t use very often — ready for transport. Then when it comes to move day, you can pack away all your key equipment last, such as desks and computers. Of course, working closely with IT to disconnect and reconnect all the technical equipment with minimal disruption is a complex task in itself, but planning for this to be carried out at the right time for each department will minimise disruption. When unpacking your office equipment, consider prioritising it in the same way you did when you packed it — leaving the non-essential stuff for a more convenient time.

6. Recycle or donate unwanted office equipment

Whilst your staff are sorting out all the office items held in the darkest depths of both personal and public store cupboards, they will inevitably discover a range of equipment that your business no longer needs. Rather than simply throw it all in a skip, think about how such items can be recycled, sold or donated to staff and reputable charities. Staff will appreciate the opportunity to take unwanted equipment home with them where possible, which could help to counteract any stress they may suffer as a result of the move. Donating to charities not only gives vital equipment to worthy causes, it also gives your business a positive story to shout about via social media!

483,NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL ANNOUNCES $500M ...,https://news.northwesternmutual.com/2023-02-02-NORTHWESTERN-MUTUAL-ANNOUNCES-500M-INVESTMENT-IN-DOWNTOWN-MILWAUKEE-CAMPUS,,"Northwestern Mutual Announces $500M Investment in Downtown Milwaukee Campus

Investment in North Office Building to bring downtown campus capacity to 9,000 and serve as expanded hub for employees, financial representatives, and business and community partners

MILWAUKEE, Feb. 2, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Northwestern Mutual today announced plans to invest more than $500 million in its North Office Building located at 818 East Mason Street in downtown Milwaukee to expand its world-class workplace and employee experience.

The development plans include extensive interior and exterior renovations to the 540,000-square-foot building to mirror the iconic and award-winning architecture of the Tower and Commons, new connecting structures, and a pedestrian plaza on Cass Street. The plan is contingent on City of Milwaukee approval of a tax incremental financing (TIF) plan that will bring millions of dollars in additional property tax revenue to the City.

""We are doubling down on our Milwaukee campus by investing in the future of the workplace for Northwestern Mutual and a thriving downtown community,"" said Northwestern Mutual Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer John Schlifske. ""We are expanding our world-class campus so that our teams can best serve our clients and policyowners in helping them achieve financial security by protecting what they've already built and creating future prosperity.""

Schlifske added, ""Our strategic investment will further our goal of creating an unparalleled campus experience, fostering connection and collaboration across employees, financial representatives and the community while attracting and retaining the next generation of talent right here in southeast Wisconsin.""

As part of the company's plans, employees will be relocated from Northwestern Mutual's Franklin, Wis. campus over the next three to five years. Nearly 2,000 employees will transition to the reimagined downtown campus, which will also accommodate planned company growth.

""Northwestern Mutual is an incredible community partner and their investment in Milwaukee will signal to the state, region and nation that Milwaukee is the place to do business,"" said Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson. ""Their wide-ranging investments in our city have – and will continue – to move Milwaukee forward.""

Pending City of Milwaukee approvals, construction could begin as early as fall 2023, with potential occupancy in 2027.

Expanding the Tower and Commons Experience to the North Office Building, Activating Cass Street

Northwestern Mutual's North Office Building was completed in 1990 – nearly three decades before the company's signature Tower and Commons was completed in 2017.

""We were proud to partner with City officials to help transform Milwaukee's skyline and provide an unparalleled experience to thousands of Northwestern Mutual employees with our Tower and Commons project,"" said Schlifske. ""With this exciting new endeavor, we will extend that same experience to all our employees by aligning our North Office Building to the Tower and Commons experience.""

The transformation of the North Office Building will include a full building renovation to visually complement the Tower and Commons Building, enhanced employee amenities, events space, and public engagement. The redesign and more efficient use of the space will result in additional usable square footage and overall downtown campus capacity.

As part of the project, Northwestern Mutual is proposing the creation of a pedestrian plaza at the intersection of Mason and Cass Streets that will better activate the area for the public, employees and visitors. Plans call for the elimination of automobile traffic on a portion of North Cass Street between East Mason and East Wells Streets.

While initial design renderings have been created, more detailed designs are expected by mid-2023.

Franklin Campus Served the Company Well for Two Decades

More than 20 years ago, Northwestern Mutual developed the first phase of a suburban office campus located at 1 Northwestern Mutual Way in Franklin, Wis. Since that initial development, Northwestern Mutual has continued its investment in and around its Franklin campus and in neighboring Oak Creek, Wis., and has helped attract major development in both communities.

Today, the Franklin campus includes two buildings totaling more than 880,000 square feet of office space, plus an additional 16 acres for future development. Amenities include ample parking, walking trails, and ponds.

The company has no immediate plans to sell or lease the buildings, as employees will continue to operate from the Franklin location for three to five years; however, the company anticipates the property will be highly desirable to a future company seeking Class A office space.

According to Schlifske, the Franklin campus has served Northwestern Mutual well, but it is time to adapt and lean into the future by bringing people together, consolidating, modernizing, and positioning the Milwaukee campus as the primary cultural and operational center of Northwestern Mutual.

""The City of Franklin has been a valued partner for more than 20 years,"" said Schlifske. ""We have invested in the community and transformed 80 acres of land, with 16 acres remaining for future development. It is our hope that our investment will attract another great out-of-state company to call Wisconsin home.""

Investment Builds on Success of Tower and Commons Project

The announcement comes almost exactly 10 years after Northwestern Mutual announced its 1.1 million-square-foot Tower and Commons project. The plan agreed to by the City of Milwaukee included significant goals around the vendors, firms and labor utilized in the construction of the Tower and Commons, which the company successfully met.

""Our decision to build the Tower and Commons downtown made a huge statement about metro Milwaukee's attractiveness as a place to live and work and created job opportunities for our broader community that continue to have a ripple effect to this day,"" said Schlifske. ""We believe in Milwaukee – which has been our hometown for nearly all of our 165-plus year history – which is why we were up to the challenge to ensure we met and exceeded the bold hiring goals advanced with the City.""

As part of the Company's 2012 agreement with the City, Northwestern Mutual committed to award 25 percent of the total value of applicable contracts to Milwaukee Small Business Enterprises (SBEs). Northwestern Mutual exceeded this goal, awarding $127 million, or 31 percent of the total value of applicable construction and professional services contracts, to local SBEs. The company also committed to ensure at least 40 percent of labor hours on the project would be worked by Milwaukee residents eligible under the Residents Preference Program (RPP). Northwestern Mutual also exceeded this goal, with Milwaukee residents eligible under the RPP performing 43 percent of the construction hours on the project.

The City's monetary obligation under the Tower and Commons tax incremental district (TID) is anticipated to be fully paid earlier than expected.

Developer-funded TIF to Pave the Way for Major Investment

""To complement Northwestern Mutual's investment, the city is advancing a financing tool that adds value without imposing a burden on city taxpayers,"" said Mayor Johnson. ""Over the long run, the city's participation adds tax base and economic strength to Milwaukee.""

According to Johnson, like the Tower and Commons project, the City of Milwaukee has proposed a tax increment financing (TIF) plan to facilitate this new project. As was the case with the Tower and Commons project, rather than have the City borrow money to finance the plan, the proposed financing would be structured as a developer-funded tax incremental district (TID).

Under this method, Northwestern Mutual will initially pay for all the costs of the project.

Once the company's new building is producing property tax revenue beyond that generated by the current North Office Building, a portion of those ""incremental"" taxes will be returned to Northwestern Mutual. These payments are contingent on numerous commitments including:

Utilizing SBEs for at least 25 percent of construction and supply costs and at least 18 percent of professional services costs on the construction of the project;

Utilizing unemployed and underemployed residents, pursuant to the City's RPP, for no less than 40 percent of total onsite construction ""worker hours"" expended on construction of the project;

Adhering to the requirements contemplated by the City's Community-Oriented, Responsible and Equitable (CORE) Development Zone Resolution, which applies to certain workers and requires a starting $15 per hour minimum wage with built-in escalators;

per hour minimum wage with built-in escalators; Committing to have no less than 5,375 employees assigned to its downtown campus upon completion of the project and no less than 5,750 employees assigned to its downtown campus by January 1, 2030 and for the duration of the term of the TID; and

and for the duration of the term of the TID; and Continued and enhanced investment in Milwaukee communities through the Northwestern Mutual Foundation.

Northwestern Mutual will receive 75 percent of the tax increment and the City will receive 25 percent until a net present value total of $30 million is paid to the company. If for some reason the project produces less property tax revenue than expected, Northwestern Mutual may not have the full $30 million developer funding repaid to it.

""Northwestern Mutual has proven time and again that they are committed to our City,"" said Milwaukee Common Council President José Pérez. ""Their growth, success and investment in Milwaukee benefits our entire community.""

Commitment to Milwaukee

In addition to calling Milwaukee its home for more than 165 years and being the largest property taxpayer in the City of Milwaukee, Northwestern Mutual and its employees support the community in many ways.

The Northwestern Mutual Foundation has given more than $465 million to nonprofits nationwide since its inception in 1992; $248 million of those funds stayed in Wisconsin and more than 52 percent of the foundation's grants have benefitted organizations in southeastern Wisconsin. In 2022, the Northwestern Mutual Foundation's total giving exceeded $23 million.

Northwestern Mutual employees are also leaders in volunteerism. In 2022 alone, employees donated over 28,800 employee volunteer hours.

Since 2013, Northwestern Mutual, through its Foundation, has invested nearly $15 million in Milwaukee's Amani, Metcalfe Park and Muskego Way neighborhoods, supporting nonprofit organizations focused on fostering safe neighborhoods, healthy and thriving youth, and strong families. Most recently, in 2022 the company announced $1.7 million in grants to nearly 30 nonprofit organizations in these neighborhoods.

Locally, the company also collaborates with schools and educational programs to increase access to quality education and supports the leading attractions that make Milwaukee a great place to live and visit. Northwestern Mutual is among the largest corporate donors to the United Way of Greater Milwaukee and the United Performing Arts Fund with employee, retiree and foundation contributions to the organizations totaling more than $100 million since 2022.

361,NU proposes inflationary tuition increases to help close ...,https://nebraskaexaminer.com/2024/06/13/nu-proposes-inflationary-tuition-increases-to-help-close-budget-deficit/,19 часов назад,"LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska’s top financial leader expects NU to wipe out a lingering deficit from NU’s budget next year through inflation-connected tuition increases and spending cuts.

Major components of the budget proposal, which the NU Board of Regents will consider next Thursday, include tuition increases of about 3.2% to 3.4% and remaining efforts to close out a budget deficit that totaled more than $50 million in past years.

Interim NU President Chris Kabourek, also NU’s chief financial officer, said the proposal provides President-elect Jeffrey Gold a “clean slate to build off of for the future.” This was one of Kabourek’s highest goals, he said.

Another was to help shift focus beyond cuts and tuition increases to key university priorities, like addressing brain drain and workforce demands.

Tuition increases

Proposed tuition increases would gather about $12 million more from students annually. That translates to $9 more per credit hour for resident undergraduate students at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln or $135 more annually for average 15-credit semesters.

In-state students at similar campuses in Omaha and Kearney will see increases, too, but slightly less than at UNL. Nonresident, international and graduate students, who already pay more, will face bigger increases. These vary across NU’s campuses and for specific programs.

“We think that’s a responsible, very fairly modest proposal to ask our students to participate,” Kabourek said, noting that about 85% of students receive some form of financial aid.

The NU Board of Regents voted to increase tuition for the first time in three years last year by 3.5% across the board, after holding rates flat during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Kabourek said he doesn’t take proposed increases lightly, noting he was a first-generation Pell Grant recipient from rural David City, but that to achieve NU’s goals, everyone must contribute.

“The university is going to have to become more efficient,” he said.

The budget proposal also anticipates raising about $5 million in additional tuition revenue from stabilizing or increased enrollment. This would “buck” years of declining enrollment across all campuses but the University of Nebraska Medical Center, Kabourek said, though he is “cautiously optimistic” about 2024-25 enrollment numbers based on early figures.

More permanent spending cuts

Campus chancellors have permanently cut $30 million from their budgets over the past two years and would need to find $11.8 million more in cuts. Campus leaders will also need to absorb another $3.1 million in inflationary costs and reprioritize spending “just as Nebraska families are doing,” according to the proposal.

Chancellors at UNL and the University of Nebraska at Kearney led the way in the previous cuts, which included structural reductions in Lincoln and program eliminations in Kearney.

Specific cuts will be determined in the coming months.

“We’re going to try to do everything we can to do this stuff in the back office and those kinds of things with a goal of maintaining affordable access,” Kabourek said.

NU officials had planned for higher inflation of 5% when calculating NU’s previous budget hole, Kabourek said. Inflation has now slowed to 3.4% and continues to go down, leading to more savings.

Presidential Scholars Program expansion

Kabourek celebrated a proposed $1.5 million investment in the Presidential Scholars Program, which offers a full-cost-of-attendance scholarship plus an annual $5,000 stipend for students to attend an NU campus if they obtain a perfect ACT score (on a 36-point scale), or the equivalent on the SAT (1570 or above).

The funding will help NU support annual groups of 50 presidential scholars. About 30 graduating K-12 students in Nebraska earn perfect ACT scores each year. NU intends to launch a competitive scholarship application in the next year for students who score a 32 or above.

At least 17 presidential scholars will be part of the inaugural program in the fall. This increased by one student from earlier in the week when NU celebrated top performers with Gov. Jim Pillen at the Nebraska State Capitol.

Kabourek has said the program for “all Nebraska, five-star scholars” is similar to outreach for top athletes. He’s promised that students who leave the state for college or don’t go to college right away could still join the program, similar to the athletic transfer portal.

NU expects to include professional mentorship and internship opportunities for the scholars.

“It’s not going to be solved completely by the university, it’s going to take all of us, but hopefully this will be a display of the university’s commitment on how we really want to address the brain drain issue going forward,” Kabourek said.

Rural health education

With support from Pillen and the Legislature, the NU budget puts $15 million into recruitment and operating costs for the Kristensen Rural Health Education Complex in Kearney. Kabourek said the funds will help provide a “runway” for when the building is expected to open early 2026.

The facility will train high demand medical professionals in rural areas in need of medical support, aiming to entice many to stay in Kearney or central and western parts of the state.

President Gold, the current chancellor of UNMC and the NU system’s top academic officer, will also receive $1.5 million to use on priorities of his choosing when he takes office July 1.

Regents are expected to approve the final version of Gold’s contract next week as well: a five-year term with a base salary of $1,062,573 in addition to various bonuses.

Gold has said he plans to remain in the position for as long as the regents will have him. Should he choose to resign before June 30, 2028, he would owe NU $250,000.

Faculty and staff outside employee unions — at UNL and UNMC — are proposed a 3% merit-based salary increase pool. Increases for union employees at UNK and the University of Nebraska at Omaha will be subject to collective bargaining agreements.

‘Storm clouds’ parting, challenges still ahead

Kabourek said the budget “only solves our problem for the next 12 months” in the face of headwinds and other economic challenges.

Still, he said, it’s a “good starting point” as it looks as if some “storm clouds” are starting to part.

“We’re still going to have to have uncomfortable conversations, the courage to think differently, to push through inertia and not be satisfied with the status quo,” Kabourek said. “That’s really where our opportunity is to take the next step to achieve some of those academic aspirations that we’ve laid out there.”

687,Netflix Product Strategy: A 2020 Market King Case Study,https://productled.com/blog/netflixs-2020-product-strategy,4 июн. 2024 г.,"Netflix was the world’s largest streaming service in 2020 with over 193 million subscribers and climbing. Software as a service (SaaS) companies took notice and wanted in on the secret sauce to Netflix’s product strategy.

What was their secret to onboarding new users and customer success?

I’m going to share a few models to help you define your product strategy. Each of these models will be brought to life with a mock 2020 articulation of Netflix's product strategy.

But First: How Netflix Started

Netflix’s product vision began with a simple goal – to get big on DVD. When Netflix started out, they were a DVD rental company, and customers had DVDs delivered to them via postal services. Then, the company’s vision evolved to become a leader in the streaming market. Going digital enabled Netflix to expand worldwide. Having achieved all of the above, Netflix is currently placing a strong focus on original content.

What is a Product Strategy?

Product strategy is a key part of product-led growth (PLG). It’s a plan that helps your company establish a specific product vision and how teams work together to successfully achieve it.

Before we begin to explore Netflix’s product strategy, it’s important to understand why product strategy is so important and necessary.

Firstly, a strategic product plan helps us to communicate an inspired vision of the future. It’s one thing to have an idea in your head, but you need the right strategies in place to help communicate that vision to others.

Secondly, combining innovation and invention is no easy task. Inventing new solutions and features can be chaotic, and it’s almost impossible to be innovative without any chaos. However, products change, and company decisions cannot happen at random. There must be discipline, and a product development strategy is effective at blending these two forces.

A product development strategy is about forming hypotheses to what I call the DHM model. In other words, you need it to delight customers and do so in a margin-enhancing way.

Finally, you need a product strategy to help facilitate prioritization. We must prioritize some things over others, and having a strategy in place can help you to do that while also communicating a plan.

As product leaders, we can do anything, but we can’t do everything.

3 Product Strategy Frameworks

A product strategy framework is a guiding light for every department in your SaaS company. I want to briefly introduce three models for product strategy because I’ll be sharing (in later sections) how to put each to use in the context of Netflix’s 2020 product strategy.

Here are three models (or frameworks) to define your product strategy:

Get Big, Lead, Expand (GLEe) model is a product strategy model that helps provide a longterm vision. It’s about growing the company to get big in its first 5 to 10 years and then expanding into different chapters of growth later. Grow, Expand, Monetize (GEM) model helps different departments like marketing, finance, and Product teams to align with each other. How do you prioritize growth, expansion, and monetization? Delight, Hard to Copy, Monetize (DHM) model is about delighting your users in hard-to-copy ways.

The purpose of these models includes:

Encourage people to think long-term

Build cross-functional alignment

Help people to form hypotheses to compete long-term

Netflix’s Product Strategy Framework: DHM

If you’re a product leader, like Netflix in 2020, your main job is to delight customers in hard-to-copy margin-enhancing ways.

So, how did Netflix’s product leaders achieve this?

Netflix uses a DHM framework.

The company offers customers a very convenient service with a wide selection of movies and TV shows they can stream instantly anytime, anywhere. Customers can navigate Netflix’s selection very easily, and they get a lot of value for their money. Plus, Netflix offers customers a range of high-quality and entertaining original content.

How Netflix’s Product Strategy Increases Profits

A key part of Netflix’s product strategy is to increase profits so they can reinvest in making an even better product in the future. I refer to this as margin-enhancing and Netflix effectively increases profits in various ways.

Let’s take a closer look at the last point in the graphic above [– right-size original content investment.

Since Netflix wants to offer a wide range of movies and TV shows to suit all types of tastes and preferences, the company likes to invest in original content. However, they want to pay the right amount for this content.

To do this as accurately as possible, Netflix predicts how many people will watch a certain TV show or movie and then line up the cost of investment with their prediction.

For example, Netflix predicted that 100 million people would watch their original series Stranger Things. Therefore, they were willing to invest $500 million in that series. The series Bojack Horseman was predicted to gain 20 million viewers, so the right-size investment in that show was estimated to be $100 million.

What Made Netflix’s 2020 Product Strategy Hard to Copy

In 2020, Netflix wasn’t the world’s biggest streaming service for nothing. It was very hard for other companies and streaming services to copy what Netflix did, and that made it difficult for competitors to compete.

Netflix is a trusted brand. You can trust Netflix to keep your personal details private. Their brand promise is “movie enjoyment made easy,” and they achieve this by providing viewers with personalized service and the freedom to watch on almost any device with an internet connection.

Here’s why Netflix is hard to copy:

Brand

Unique technology

Network effect

Economies of scale

The brand promise of Netflix is movie enjoyment made easy. The company is a movie subscription service that delivers fast, easy entertainment in a friendly, straightforward way.

Netflix Product Team’s Priorities

The product team at Netflix prioritizes monthly retention as the company’s high-level engagement metric. The team prioritizes other metrics too, including growth and monetization.

When the COVID pandemic hit in 2020, movie theaters were closed, and more people had free time at home. The company’s product team focused on key high-level product strategies (see below):

Here’s an example of the Netflix 2020 rolling roadmap, which shows how Netflix is implementing each strategy every quarter:

Netflix Case Studies

Now, let's look at some ways Netflix was able to win their users' attention by offering additional products.

Case Study 1: Netflix Party

Netflix Party (now Teleparty) is a Chrome extension app that has become increasingly popular since COVID-19. It allows users to watch the same movie at the same time. They can even chat with each other while watching a movie or TV show.

In an isolated time, such as a lockdown during the pandemic, many people enjoyed using this Chrome extension to watch movies with friends and family long-distance.

But is this an idea that Netflix should execute itself?

In the past, Netflix has tried a few variations of social experiments, including Friends in 2009, Xbox Party Mode in 2010, and Tell a Friend in 2018. All three were killed off because not enough people used the features.

However, Netflix Party has proven to be quite a success. In 2020, the app grew from 500 thousand to one million in just 60 days and acquired 10 million downloads. This data shows a substantial proof of concept, making it a possible worthwhile investment for Netflix. But the question remains – will this delight in hard-to-copy, margin-enhancing ways?

Well, this extension is hard to copy, and it would take competitors years to mimic something of this scale. It has the potential to enhance profits via word-of-mouth and increase retention.

Case Study 2: Auto-Cancel Inactive Members

Should Netflix auto-cancel inactive members?

In 2020, one-half percent of Netflix members hadn’t used the service in the last 12 months. However, those members were still paying for the service despite rarely using it.

Some might argue that a better alternative would be to send those members an email notification alerting them to the fact they’ve been inactive for so long. The email could say something like, “Would you like to cancel?” Then, the user could decide whether they wanted to continue paying for the monthly subscription or cancel their membership.

If members say no, then their service would continue as normal. If they say yes, then their membership would be canceled. However, what happens to the members who don’t respond? Should their membership be auto-canceled?

In 2020, if Netflix were to auto-cancel all of the inactive members, the company would lose $100 million. Clearly, introducing the auto-cancel option was not a great way to enhance profits, as the company would be losing millions of dollars each year. But what about the delight and hard-to-copy side of their product strategy?

Offering the auto-cancel feature for inactive users may delight customers since Netflix automatically stops payments. The user could always rejoin if they choose to do so.

Auto canceling inactive Netflix users, in my opinion, would be a worthwhile strategy for Netflix to implement and here’s why:

I think that product teams and product leaders can learn a lot from Netflix’s winning 2020 product strategy, which can help you make more strategic day-to-day decisions and implement product strategies that will help you reach your vision and goals.",strategizing new office location
56,Nevada has a plan to expand electronic voting. That ...,https://www.columbian.com/news/2024/jun/10/nevada-has-a-plan-to-expand-electronic-voting-that-concerns-election-security-experts/,4 дня назад,"Voting on reservations across the country has historically been difficult, with tribal voters sometimes having to travel dozens of miles to their polling place. Slow mail service and lack of a physical address, common on tribal lands, have proved challenging.

The new process — the ability to cast ballots electronically — has the potential to significantly boost turnout among all tribes in Nevada. But what some see as a small measure of justice to equalize voting rights raises security concerns for others, with implications far beyond Nevada’s 28 tribal communities as the nation braces for what is expected to be another close and contentious presidential election in November.

Under the plan, tribal members in Nevada who live on a reservation or colony can receive a ballot electronically through an online system set up by the state and then return it electronically. Experts warn that such voting — when a completed ballot is sent back either by email, through an online portal or by fax — carries risks of ballots being intercepted or manipulated and should be used sparingly, if at all.

“At this point in the United States, it’s a relatively small number of ballots that are coming through that way,” said Larry Norden, an election expert with the Brennan Center for Justice. “But we should be very concerned — both from actual security risks but also from a public confidence point of view — about expanding this.”",plans to expand office

18,New Pentagon AI & data chief plans big initiatives for fall ...,https://breakingdefense.com/2024/06/new-pentagon-ai-data-chief-plans-big-initiatives-for-fall-from-back-office-to-battlefield-exclusive/,4 дня назад,"WASHINGTON — Less than two months into her new post as the Pentagon’s Chief Digital & Artificial Intelligence Officer, Radha Plumb is working on some big plans for the coming months.

“Our goal is to at least start some of those announcements by the end of the summer,” Plumb told Breaking Defense in her first interview since taking the job. “But certainly, between the end of the summer through the fall, you’ll start seeing those publicly in terms of solicitations, solutions, that sort of thing.”

Her first big move since taking office was to hand out a set of awards for a new model of AI and big data analytics that CDAO calls Open DAGIR, short for “Open Data and Applications Government-owned Interoperable Repositories.” That initiative gives upstart defense contractor Palantir up to $513 million to build “mission command” data and planning tools for the military’s four-star Combatant Commands around the world — part of the Pentagon’s high-priority push to expand its nascent global command network, called CJADC2.

But the way CDAO structured Open DAGIR — both the technological architecture and the contract language — creates a model Plumb plans to expand to a wide range of other areas, starting with AI-powered “enterprise analytics” for back office business functions, and a “tactical layer” for units in combat.

What’s more, as the “Open” in its name implies, the new model does not depend on Palantir or any single prime contractor, as in many traditional Pentagon programs. Instead, Plumb emphasized, it’s meant to open the door wide to rapid innovation from a host of competing vendors, large and small.

“Palantir, right now, is one of the providers,” Plumb told Breaking Defense. “Our goal is really to have multiple providers in that ecosystem … That’s partly a competition issue, but partly a technology issue.”

Certainly, being able to pick between competing vendors gets the government better prices, she said. But just as important, no one company will have the best tech for all the different things the Department of Defense needs to do.

“You want the infrastructure you design for mission command to look different than the data infrastructure you want, say, for enterprise analytics,” she said. “You want that to look still different than, say, your tactical data infrastructure.”

Imagine a spectrum of systems, with enterprise analytics at one end, tactical data on the other, and theater-level mission command somewhere in the middle. The “enterprise” is the Pentagon’s back office business functions, ranging from financial management and human resources to weapons development and acquisition. Those can operate much like a commercial firm, even using some of the same commercial software, cloud-based services, and high-speed internet to crunch vast amounts of data day-to-day.

At the other extreme, units in combat need to get updated tactical data in hours or minutes, and they need it delivered over rugged radio networks that can withstand not just extremes of climate but enemy hacking, jamming, and attempts to triangulate the source of signals for precision strike. There’s no commercial market for such a system. However, troops in combat don’t need to crunch massive databases to prepare thousand-page budget requests or financial audits. They mostly need coordinates and status of targets, threats, friendlies, and objectives, ASAP.

“Enterprise analytics… could be higher latency,” Plub explained. “Tactical data… you want to be very low latency, but much lower volume of data.”

But there’s one more wrinkle: A theater planner or battlefield commander will sometimes want to pull logistical and business data — maintenance status on a unit’s vehicles, for instance, or medical records on casualties. So while the tactical, theater, and enterprise systems all need to work at different speeds and scales to serve their different users, they also need to be interconnected and able to share data, not isolated in separate silos.

There’s no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem, no one mega-contract or super-vendor to solve all these problems, no One Ring to rule them all. Instead, Plumb said, “what we want to do is, for each of those infrastructure investments, [to] make sure we’re getting the right company and the right architecture.”

Sometimes this means inventing new systems, she said. Often, however, it means building on proven tech the DoD has already invested in, like Palantir’s Maven Smart System for COCOM planners — which last week’s contracts expanded tenfold — or Booz Allen Hamilton’s work on the Advana enterprise analytics system.

“The Department’s actually invested in all of these things already,” Plumb said. “They just haven’t been — to use it as a verb — ‘Open-DAGIRed’ yet…. Part of this kind of six-month procurement during the run is getting the contracts for those right so that we can make them more modular and less vertically integrated.”

From Open DAGIR To Data Stacks

Plumb’s Open DAGIR model is a layered approach, with many interconnected pieces. It is meant to be modular, able to swap out any vendor’s software and seamlessly swap in another’s, while all other elements keep working smoothly and without interruption.

That plug-and-play process is easy in principle but takes a lot of clever engineering in practice. In the Pentagon, it also requires considerable contracting finesse. For Maven Smart System, Plumb made a point of working through the Army Contracting Command, whose skills she extolled.

“We took two months to negotiate just that kind of enterprise license piece, so that we can maximize government leverage but [also] ensure reliable access to this mature application,” she said.

In particular, in order to change contractors at will without losing access to key data or functions, the Department of Defense needs to own the data — and not just the raw data scattered around disparate DoD databases, Plumb emphasized, but the metadata and analytic outputs built on that data as well.

“Start with the data infrastructure,” Plumb said. “At that layer, rather than having one solid slab at the bottom, we already have this data mesh” — that is, a “federated” system that connects many distinct databases maintained by different DoD organizations, rather than trying to dump everyone’s data into one massive (and often unmanageable) “data lake.”

“The infrastructure needs to match that,” she went on. “[That means] having it be multi-vendor, with clear documentation and government ownership of, not just the data that goes in and the data that comes out, but the secret sauce that happens in the middle: the metadata management and business logic [and] data ontology…. We need to know what’s the processing that’s done to the data from the raw data up to the data product.”

How swappable will systems be in reality? In the current iteration of Open DAGIR, everything depends on Palantir. The Denver-based company runs the foundational data layer; it runs the primary suit of software applications that use that data, Maven Smart System; and it even manages the marketplace for trying out innovative new applications from third parties.

But, Plumb emphasized, the government is still calling the shots on what third-party software to bring in, rather than letting Palantir act as a prime contractor or “lead systems integrator” that can pick and choose its subcontractors.

“Palantir is tasked with integration because they are the contract operator for the stack, but the selection of third-party vendors and the negotiations on data rights and IP is [done] in partnership with the government,” she said. “Rather than Palantir deciding what third-party vendor it wants to integrate and offer up to the government, we’re deciding what are our requirements, who are our third-party vendors, what is the data they need, and then pushing them into the stack that we own.”

What’s more, the data system that Palantir now runs is not the only one CDAO plans to build, Plumb said. Her long term goal is multiple, interoperable “data stacks” for different kinds of data, she told Breaking Defense, all owned by the government but operated by the best contractor for that specific task, all accessible to software applications built by any vendor and to users in the tactical, theater, and enterprise worlds.

“The Department’s actually invested in all of these things already,” Plumb said. “Now…we’re making the enduring investments in that infrastructure, so it is available in a reliable way, with the right open-data interoperability principles, so that we can actually build applications.”",plans to open new office
138,New Twist in Bears' Stadium Plans,https://frontofficesports.com/newsletter/new-twist-in-bears-stadium-plans/,14 часов назад,"The Bears insist they’re still entirely focused on their proposed $4.7 billion stadium project on the downtown Chicago lakefront. But the political and financial difficulties already swirling around the effort have prompted a marked resurgence of the suburban pushes to land the NFL team.

In some ways echoing the extended tour the Bears made of the Chicago area last year in pursuit of a stadium site, both Aurora and Arlington Heights have renewed their public pursuit of the Bears.

The core of both suburban arguments is the same: with the Bears fighting an uphill battle to get the downtown stadium project going, the more distant options provide an alternative that could represent a materially easier path to actually completing the project. The Illinois legislature recently concluded its spring session without taking up the Bears issue.

“Instead of negotiating with state and local officials over where the money for a new lakefront stadium in Chicago will come from, we’re poised to immediately welcome the Bears’ storied franchise to the City of Lights,” wrote Aurora officials, including mayor Richard Irvin, in a recent Chicago Tribune op-ed.

Not to be outdone, Arlington Heights also said there is a rather different conversation to be had now with the Bears.

“By no means do I think it is over,” Arlington Heights trustee Jim Bertucci told the Daily Herald in Illinois. “If they want to come back and look more seriously again at Arlington Heights, I think we’re going to have a better path for them than [it] was in the past, and maybe an easier path than what’s happening in Chicago.”

The team still owns 326 acres of land in Arlington Heights, and it had intended to place the stadium there before running into a tax dispute with the town.

Walking a Careful Line

The renewed suburban interest has created a rather delicate situation for the Bears. On one hand, the Bears certainly do not want to forfeit any potential momentum around the downtown project, and certainly don’t want to appear fickle or indecisive with any public official. At the same time, though, having additional options could prove vital, particularly if the team is not ultimately able to make the lakefront vision a reality.

“Every jurisdiction has their own way of doing business. This is exactly what I expected,” said team president Kevin Warren at a Lincoln Forum event with the Union League Club of Chicago. “We live in a complicated world. This is an election year. … We have a lot of complex issues that we are dealing with. So I’m a realist to understand these projects are not something you do just over a weekend.”

The Bears have estimated that every year lost to delays adds more than $150 million to the stadium cost. The project is also premised in part on creating a domed stadium that would make the No. 3 media market in the U.S. eligible to bid for major events such as the Super Bowl, Final Four, and College Football Playoff.

The team will be featured on Hard Knocks this summer after years of resistance to the high-profile documentary series. Meanwhile, rookie quarterback Caleb Williams, the top selection in the 2024 NFL draft, has introduced his 888 Midas investment firm.",announced plans for new office

696,Nonprofit Strategic Planning: Ultimate Guide + 7 Examples,https://bloomerang.co/blog/nonprofit-strategic-planning/,,"Nonprofit strategic planning can help your organization meet challenges effectively and take advantage of new opportunities. Despite the many benefits that strategic planning can bring, 49 percent of nonprofits lack a strategic plan.

Organizations that do have a strategic plan continually express the advantages that this type of preparation gives them. One study found that 86 percent of respondents believed that having a strategic plan positively impacted revenue generation through grants, donors, events and other avenues.

Whether you’re starting a new nonprofit, crafting an emergency plan to react to unexpected external circumstances, or creating your strategy for the next two to five years, this guide will help your nonprofit get the most out of its strategic plan. We’ll cover:

Annual strategic planning is the key to unlocking your growth potential for the future. Let’s get started.

Nonprofit strategic planning FAQs What is strategic planning for nonprofits? Nonprofit strategic planning is the process of creating a blueprint that guides an organization for a specified time period and helps accomplish its goals. The strategic planning process involves reflecting on your mission to identify your most important goals and determining the strategies you’ll use to reach them. A good strategic plan ensures you have charted the necessary pathways to meet (and hopefully exceed) your organization’s goals. How often should you develop a standard nonprofit strategic plan? Ideally, every three to five years, your board and staff directors will meet to realign goals and begin the strategic planning process. This plan is a living blueprint based on everyone’s ideas. What are common misconceptions about nonprofit strategic planning? When it comes to strategic planning, there are a few common hesitations that nonprofits voice throughout the process. Here are three misconceptions about the process: Our nonprofit should be focused on saving/generating money, not spending it. It’s a cliche, but it’s true — you have to spend money to make money. During the strategic planning process, you should identify areas to spend money effectively in ways that increase your fundraising return on investment. When you make strategic purchasing decisions, you can set your organization up to fundraise more productively than ever before.

Our nonprofit shouldn’t take any risks. Your nonprofit shouldn’t fear experimentation — taking calculated risks fuels innovation and helps you reach your mission more efficiently.

Volunteer boards should take charge of fundraising. We recommend that you don’t place board members in charge of setting strategic direction. The board should be tasked with providing oversight of your organization’s strategy, not setting the priorities themselves.

Learn more about common strategic planning misconceptions in this Bloomerang webinar: How do you begin the nonprofit strategic planning process? You’ll discuss measurable objectives for the team to reach and draft the priorities for each of these objectives. You may begin with a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis. This can help you start defining goals and considering which strategic planning model will best work for your organization.

Types of nonprofit strategic plans Different circumstances and goals will require different types of nonprofit strategic plans. Choose a strategic planning model based on your nonprofit’s current circumstances, opportunities and threats. Carefully examine the following strategic model plans to decide which one will best suit your nonprofit’s needs: Standard Strategic Planning Model The standard strategic planning model, also known as the basic planning model, vision-based model, goals-based model or conventional model, is the most common nonprofit strategic planning model. It’s best to use this model when your organization’s external surroundings are generally calm. When you start using this model, the economy is probably stable, your community and country are at peace and your organization is well-established in the community. Generally, this model follows these steps: Define your organization’s mission and goals.

Set specific, short-term goals you would like to reach to get you closer to those larger goals.

Create a clear plan to reach short-term goals, including who is responsible for each goal’s success.

Write these actions down and create a timeline to complete each one. Here’s an example of what this would look like: Let’s say your organization is an animal shelter. In the next year, your specific short-term goal is to increase the shelter’s capacity by 50 animals and invest in the materials to do so. To do this, your organization will need to increase fundraising revenue by $10,000 by finding new outreach opportunities and strengthening relationships with existing supporters to increase donor retention. You may decide to ask one team member to post to social media every day to engage your online audience. Meanwhile, you may assign another person to call new donors to thank them and increase your new donor retention. This model is the most common because the climate in which your organization resides is, more often than not, fairly stable. When it does become unstable, that means it’s time to switch to a different model. Issues-Based Strategic Planning Model An issues-based strategic planning model can be used when your organization’s internal operations are in more turbulent conditions. For example, if you’re undergoing frequent staff turnover, a change in leadership or are understaffed, you may find an issues-based strategic planning model to be the best choice. This nonprofit strategic planning model helps organizations get back on track if they have strayed from the path to success. To implement this strategic planning model, complete the following tasks: Brainstorm the elements that are holding your organization back from success.

Decide how to address each of those elements to get your organization back on track.

Carefully monitor your progress and adjust the strategy accordingly. Consider the following scenario: Your nonprofit has limited staff and struggles to increase fundraising revenue. You may decide to address this by working with an external fundraising consultant or directing your staff’s attention to building relationships with your most engaged donors who are likely to increase their giving amounts. An issues-based nonprofit strategic planning model is a living plan. Instead of setting it in stone, set check-in milestones and make adjustments based on your progress and results. Organic Nonprofit Strategic Planning Model The organic or nonlinear nonprofit strategic planning model is best when there are uncertain external factors that threaten your nonprofit’s situation. Using this model, your team members will come together to solidify their understanding of the organization’s mission and goals. Each person then comes up with actionable next steps to help get closer to that goal by the next time the group meets. Generally, putting this model into practice looks something like this: You and your team members go on a retreat to unify your understanding of the organization’s big-picture goals.

Each team member examines their own strengths and decides on an actionable goal they can achieve based on that strength by a certain date.

The team meets together again either quarterly or annually (or as frequently as you’d like) to discuss your progress toward each goal and mission impact. For instance, you may find that one team member, Theo, is especially good at face-to-face communication on the retreat. He’s empathetic and understanding and would be a great candidate for holding meetings with major donors to build relationships with them. He may have a goal to leverage the information in your new donor database to foster relationships and grow major giving by 10% in the coming year. This model never looks the same for two organizations. Each team member has inherent strengths, so this model is designed to help your nonprofit make the most of your unique strengths. Real-Time Nonprofit Strategic Planning Model The real-time nonprofit strategic planning model is useful when your nonprofit is in the midst of a crisis, like an economic recession or national/global catastrophe. The situation could also be limited to your organization. For instance, you might have been the victim of a cyberattack or your headquarters might have been severely damaged in a tornado. This model relies on an extreme focus on short-term goals that aim to help you weather the storm. Your nonprofit staff members might meet as frequently as every week to discuss your progress toward these short-term goals. The model usually looks like this: Your organization frequently meets as a large group to define short-term objectives for individual team members.

In these team meetings, you discuss whether you’ve met these goals, your day-to-day progress and any roadblocks your organization members face.

After the crisis period, your organization takes inventory of the progress made or damage done, thanks team members for their hard work and creates a new strategic plan using a different model. Consider the following situation: You discover that your nonprofit was the victim of a cyberattack that potentially left some donors’ information at risk. In response, you meet with your team to define and align on urgent next steps. You assign several team members to assess the extent of the attack and summarize their findings into a clear report. Then, you designate other team members to notify impacted donors as quickly as possible about the breach. You outline the steps you’ll take to keep donors’ information more secure in the future and prevent future attacks. As you can see, these goals are small and manageable in a short time. Goals are created as responses to the direct impact that external forces have on your organization’s internal operations. Alignment Nonprofit Strategic Planning Model The alignment nonprofit strategic planning model is best when your organization has great individual departments or team members but has trouble when it comes to communication between these departments. This model tends to look something like this: Your team members meet to learn about the issues each individual faces in their position.

You re-establish the common mission that everyone on your team is working towards.

You outline tweaks that your team can use to improve internal communication processes. For instance, say your organization has an incredible grant writer, an excellent executive director, a communicative and empathetic major gift officer and very capable fundraisers. However, they have trouble communicating with one another about the nonprofit’s goals and what each of them is doing to reach those goals. The result is discord among teams and a lack of progress. In this case, consider ways to encourage teamwork between members. You may provide an overall fundraising goal for your fundraisers and major gift officer to work on together. Or, you may set up check-in meetings for everyone to meet with the executive director and ensure that the director knows what’s happening in each department and can prioritize their tasks accordingly. The alignment nonprofit strategic planning model is a great way to set new communication standards and processes to incorporate moving forward as a team.

Nonprofit strategic planning template Before you dive into the strategic planning process, it can be helpful to know what type of plan or report you’re going to end up with. Generally, strategic planning forms look similar to this: This template outlines all of the essential planning steps that we’ll review in the next section. Here is a high-level overview of what your plan should include: Your organization’s mission statement. Your mission statement should dive into why your organization exists. What is it that you’re trying to accomplish? How are you different from other organizations? This statement should use precise language but non-finite verbs. This leaves it open for continuous improvement and development of your mission; it will never be complete but always be a work in progress.

This statement should use precise language but non-finite verbs. This leaves it open for continuous improvement and development of your mission; it will never be but always be a work in progress. Your primary goals and specific objectives within those goals. Identify priorities for the types of programs and services you’ll offer to support your goals, target audience for your services, target supporter audiences, advocacy and public policy aims and branding or marketing objectives.

Identify priorities for the types of programs and services you’ll offer to support your goals, target audience for your services, target supporter audiences, advocacy and public policy aims and branding or marketing objectives. Who is responsible for each objective and what activities they will complete to work toward the objective. You’ll assign each team member a clear role in the process and outline the tasks they will complete that support your overarching goals. Let’s take a closer look at how to develop each aspect of your strategic plan.

5 steps of strategic planning for nonprofits Use these steps to launch the strategic planning process: 1. Set fundraising targets Use your organization’s budget to determine generally how much you need to raise to achieve your philanthropic goals. Then, outline the strategies you’ll use to acquire that funding. For example, you may decide to raise: 50% of funding from individual contributions to your annual fund

20% of funding from your planned giving, legacy and endowment programs

20% of funding from corporate giving programs

10% of funding from grants Every nonprofit will have a different breakdown of their fundraising goals based on their current fundraising initiatives and their community’s giving capacity. 2. Get input from key stakeholders Next, ask your stakeholders for input about your fundraising goals. Provide context for your goals and philanthropic objectives, explain how each will impact your mission, then ask for feedback about the plan. The different stakeholders you should reach out to include: Board members

Staff members

Key corporate and community partners

A fundraising consultant Running the plan by everyone will help you make sure that the goals you’ve set are achievable and manageable for your team. Stakeholders might raise the alarm if your fundraising amount is drastically different from last year or if you’re relying on strategies that have been ineffective in the past. For example, let’s say your nonprofit has a good track record with grant writing. You’ve won 80% of the grants you’ve applied for, so you decide to dedicate a large portion of your fundraising revenue plan to be raised using grant money. Seems reasonable, right? Well, your grant writer may bring up the valid point that you’ve only been that successful because you’re incredibly picky about the type of grant you apply for. While the percentage looks impressive, there aren’t enough grants out there to meet the goal you’ve set. This is great insight and enables you to switch up your strategy to be as successful as possible. 3. Determine your key fundraising and marketing strategies You may consider doing a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis of your past fundraising to better understand what areas you’re already strong in and what could be improved. This chart can help you outline your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats clearly and concisely: Some of the fundraising and marketing strategies your organization should take into consideration include: Major gift fundraising . Major gift fundraising likely makes up a large portion of your proceeds. If it doesn’t already, this is one area of your strategy you’ll want to improve.

Leverage the power of your social networks to raise funds using this avenue.

Peer-to-peer fundraising is a great strategy to attract new donors while raising additional funds from your committed supporters. Leverage the power of your social networks to raise funds using this avenue. Monthly giving . Recurring gifts are essential because they’re a consistent source of revenue. If someone sets up a recurring gift, you can probably count on that gift being given for an extended period and account for that in your future budget. Assign areas that need improvement a lower fundraising target than the aspects of your strategy where you already know you’re strong. This way, you can try out different strategies to make these elements stronger without as much pressure. For example, if you know your nonprofit has an incredible major giving program, specify that a larger portion of your fundraising will likely come from this avenue. If you know that you could use improvement on your new donor retention rates, you might set that at a lower goal and use this as an opportunity to try out new things like calling new donors and setting up a welcome email series. 4. Establish SMART objectives When you set your fundraising goals, make sure they’re SMART: Specific: Target a specific area for improvement

Target a specific area for improvement Measurable: Quantifiable

Quantifiable Attainable: Achievable based on your past successes

Achievable based on your past successes Realistic: Reasonable based on your available resources

Reasonable based on your available resources Time-based: Aligned with a specific time frame For example, let’s say you have a specific goal for increasing individual contributions to your annual fund. Here are a few examples of SMART goals that target this objective: Acquire 500 new donors through your online fundraising page within a year.

Call 100% of the new donors who give within 90 days of their gift.

Acquire 200 new donors through a 2-week peer-to-peer fundraising campaign.

Expand your monthly giving program by 100 donors within a year.

Retain 70% of donors from last year. These goals include specific numbers and time frames to help orient your strategic planning around quantifiable metrics. 5. Choose tactics to support each objective Use reporting tools in your donor management system and marketing platforms to help keep your team accountable for reaching your goals. Assign each team member an individual role that they’re responsible for. Here’s an example of a chart that clearly defines each activity, the staff member accountable for the task and the deadline: When everyone is clearly aware of their role at the organization and how their actions will impact the mission at large, you’ll make sure everything gets done. Plus, everyone will have a sense of purpose as a part of the team. In addition to assigning team member roles, you can also automate certain processes to free up more staff time. For example, if you used to send out the monthly newsletter manually or personally manage every social media post, consider investing in new marketing software as part of your strategic plan. Ask yourself some of the following questions. What areas of our work do we need more time for?

What can we automate?

Who at our organization has repetitive tasks that take time away from more important activities? Sometimes the answer to these questions leads you to invest in new nonprofit software like a new CRM to automate donor engagement efforts or volunteer management tools to streamline volunteer scheduling.

How donor management and fundraising software can support strategic planning Donor management and fundraising software can offer plenty of support throughout your entire strategic planning process. Here are just a few of the ways you can use integrated donor management and fundraising software to streamline your planning: Review data analytics and reports to understand your nonprofit’s current fundraising and donor engagement situation. Use this information to understand what’s going well and where there is room for improvement.

67,North American Numbering Plan,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_American_Numbering_Plan,,"Integrated telephone numbering plan of twenty North American countries

The North American Numbering Plan (NANP) is a telephone numbering plan for twenty-five regions in twenty countries, primarily in North America and the Caribbean. This group is historically known as World Zone 1 and has the telephone country code 1. Some North American countries, most notably Mexico, do not participate with the NANP.

The concepts of the NANP were devised originally during the 1940s by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&T) for the Bell System and the independent telephone companies in North America in Operator Toll Dialing. The first task was to unify the diverse local telephone numbering plans that had been established during the preceding decades, with the goal to speed call completion times and decrease the costs for long-distance calling, by reducing manual labor by switchboard operators. Eventually, it prepared the continent for direct-dialing of long-distance calls by customers, first possible in 1951 and expanded across the nation during the decades following. AT&T continued to administer the continental numbering plan and the technical infrastructure until the end of the Bell System, when administration was delegated to the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA), a service that has been procured from the private sector by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. Each participating country forms a regulatory authority that has plenary control of local numbering resources.[1] The FCC also serves as the U.S. regulator. Canadian numbering decisions are made by the Canadian Numbering Administration Consortium.[2]

The NANP divides the territories of its members into numbering plan areas (NPAs) which are encoded numerically with a three-digit telephone number prefix, commonly termed the area code.[3] Each telephone is assigned a seven-digit telephone number unique only within its respective numbering plan area. The telephone number consists of a three-digit central office (or exchange) code and a four-digit station number. The combination of an area code and the telephone number serves as a destination routing address in the public switched telephone network (PSTN). The North American Numbering Plan conforms with International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Recommendation E.164, which establishes an international numbering framework.[4]

History [ edit ]

Area code handbook issued by many telephone companies in 1962 to promote the newly introduced direct distance dialing.

From the Bell System's beginnings in 1876 and throughout the first part of the 20th century, telephone networks grew from essentially local or regional telephone systems. These systems expanded by increasing their subscriber bases, as well as increasing their service areas by implementing additional local exchanges that were interconnected with tie trunks. It was the responsibility of each local administration to devise telephone numbering plans that accommodated the local requirements and growth.[5] As a result, the North American telephone service industry developed into an unorganized set of many differing local numbering systems. The diversity impeded the efficient operation and interconnection of exchanges into a nationwide system for long-distance telephone communication. By the 1940s, the Bell System set out to unify the various existing numbering plans to provide a unified, systematic method for routing telephone calls across the nation and to provide efficient long-distance service that eventually did not require the involvement of switchboard operators.

In October 1947, AT&T published a new nationwide numbering plan in coordination with the independent telephone operators. The plan divided most of North America into eighty-six numbering plan areas (NPAs). Each NPA was assigned a unique three-digit code, typically termed NPA code or simply area code. These codes were first used in Operator Toll Dialing by long-distance operators in establishing calls via trunks between toll offices. The goal of automatic service required additional technical advances in the latest generation of toll-switching systems, completed by the early 1950s, and installation of new toll-switching systems in most numbering plan areas. The first customer-dialed direct call using an area code was made on November 10, 1951, from Englewood, New Jersey, to Alameda, California.[6] Direct distance dialing (DDD) was introduced subsequently across the country. By the early 1960s, DDD had become commonplace in cities and most towns in the United States and Canada. By 1967, the number of assigned area codes had increased to 129.[7]

The status of the network of the 1960s was represented by a new name used for technical documentation: North American Integrated Network.[7] By 1975, the numbering plan was referred to as the North American Numbering Plan,[8] resulting in the well-known initialism NANP, as other countries sought or considered joining the standardization.

Foreign expansion [ edit ]

Although Bermuda and the Caribbean islands had been assigned the area code 809 as early as 1958 by the administrators at AT&T, individual participating countries or territories had no autonomy over their numbering plan as they received centrally assigned central office prefixes that needed to be unique from those of other countries with the same area code. Regions in Mexico with high call volumes to and from the US were assigned functional area codes as early as 1963, for the purpose of call routing, but a nationwide system of participation in the NANP eventually failed.

During the decades following, the NANP expanded to include all of the United States and its territories, Canada, Bermuda, and seventeen nations of the Caribbean.[9][10]

At the request of the British Colonial Office, the numbering plan was first expanded to Bermuda and the British West Indies because of their historic telecommunications administration through Canada as parts of the British Empire and their continued associations with Canada, especially during the years of the telegraph and the All Red Line system.

Not all North American polities participate in the NANP. Exceptions include Mexico, Greenland, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, the Central American countries and some Caribbean countries (Cuba, Haiti, the French Caribbean and the Dutch Caribbean, except for Sint Maarten). The only Spanish-speaking states in the system are the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. Mexican participation was planned,[11] but implementation stopped after three area codes (706, 903 and 905) had been assigned, and Mexico opted for an international numbering format, using country code 52.[12] The area codes in use were subsequently withdrawn in 1991.

The Dutch Caribbean territory of Sint Maarten joined the NANP in September 2011, receiving area code 721.[13] Sint Maarten shares the island with the French Collectivity of Saint Martin which, like the rest of the French Caribbean, is not part of the NANP.

Administration [ edit ]

The NANP is administered by the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA, formerly Administration).[14] This function is overseen by the Federal Communications Commission, which assumed the responsibility upon the end of the Bell System. The FCC solicits private sector contracts for the role of the administrator.

Before the division of the Bell System, administration of the North American Numbering Plan was performed by AT&T's Central Services Organization. In 1984, this function was transferred to Bell Communications Research (Bellcore), a company created by the divestiture mandate to perform services for the newly created local exchange carriers. On January 19, 1998, the NANPA function was transferred to the IMS division of Lockheed Martin in Washington, D.C.[15] In 1999, the contract was awarded to Neustar, a company created from Lockheed for this purpose. The contract was renewed in 2004, and again in 2012.[16] On January 1, 2019, Somos assumed the NANPA function with a one-year bridge contract granted by the FCC with the goal of consolidating the NANPA function with the Pooling Administrator and identifying a long-term contractor.[17][18] On December 1, 2020, Somos secured the $76 million contract for a term of eight years against one other bidder.[19]

Numbering plan [ edit ]

The long-range vision of the architects of the North American Numbering Plan was a system by which telephone subscribers in the United States and Canada could themselves dial and establish a telephone call to any other subscriber without the assistance of switchboard operators. While the dialing of telephone calls by subscribers was common-place in many cities across the continent for local destinations, long-distance telephone calls had to be patched through manually by telephone operators at typically multiple intermediate toll offices using a system known since 1929 as the General Toll Switching Plan.[20] The immediate goal for improvement in the time of call establishment was to provide technology for the originating toll operators to dial calls directly to the destination. This system was known as Operator Toll Dialing.[21]

Operator Toll Dialing required a nationwide telephone numbering plan that unified all local numbering plans into a consistent universal system. Local numbering plans, many of which required only four or five digits to be dialed, or even fewer in small communities, needed to be expanded. but the goal was to enable local telephone companies to make as few changes as possible in their systems.

Numbering plan areas and central offices [ edit ]

The new numbering plan divided the North American continent into regional service areas, termed numbering plan areas (NPAs). The divisions conformed primarily to the jurisdictional boundaries of the U.S. states and the Canadian provinces.[22] Some states or provinces needed to be divided into multiple areas. NPAs were created in accordance with principles deemed to maximize customer understanding and minimize dialing effort, while reducing plant cost.[23] Each NPA was identified by a unique three-digit code number, termed the numbering plan area code, which was prefixed to the local telephone number when calling from one NPA to another. Calling within the same numbering plan area did not require dialing the area code.

The telephone exchanges—in the Bell System they were officially termed central offices—became local exchange points in the nationwide system. Each of them was also assigned a three-digit number unique within its NPA. The combination of NPA code and central office code served as a destination routing code for use by operators to reach any central office through the switching network.[22] Due to the numerical structure of the numbering system, each NPA was technically limited to 540 central offices.[23]

Although the limitation to 540 central offices required the most populous states to be divided into multiple NPAs, it was not the sole reason to subdivide a state. An important aspect was the existing infrastructure for call routing, which had developed during preceding decades, often independently of state boundaries. The rules of determining areas also attempted to avoid cutting across busy toll traffic routes, so that most toll traffic remained within an NPA, and outgoing traffic in one area would not be tributary to toll offices in an adjacent area.[24][22] As a result, New York state was initially divided into five areas, the most of any state. Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Texas were assigned four NPAs each, and California, Iowa, and Michigan received three. Eight states and provinces were divided into two NPAs.

Traditionally, central office switching systems were designed to serve as many as ten thousand subscriber numbers. Thus, subscribers were assigned four-digit line or station numbers. This rounded the total number of digits in a subscriber telephone number to ten: a three-digit area code, three-digit central office code, and four digits for each line. This fixed format defined the North American Numbering Plan as a closed numbering plan,[25] as opposed to developments in other countries where the number of digits was not fixed.

Initial numbering system [ edit ]

In 1947, AT&T completed the new design for a nationwide toll network that established the original North American area codes. The new numbering plan provided for 152 area codes, each with a capacity to serve as many as 540 central offices.[26] Originally, only eighty-six area codes were assigned. New Jersey received the first NPA code in the new system, area code 201.[27] The second area code, 202, was assigned to the District of Columbia. The allocation of area codes was readjusted as early as 1948 to account for inadequacies in some metropolitan areas. For example, the Indiana numbering plan area 317 was divided to provide a larger numbering pool in the Indiana suburbs of Chicago (area code 219).

Initially, states divided into multiple numbering plan areas were assigned area codes with the digit 1 in the second position, while areas that comprised entire states or provinces received codes with 0 as the middle digit. This rule was violated by the early 1950s,[22] as NPAs with digit 0 in the middle had to be divided, but until 1995 all area codes assigned had none other than the digits 0 and 1 in this position.

The eight codes of the form N11 (N=2–9) were reserved as service codes. The easily recognizable codes of the form N00 were available in the numbering plan, but were not initially included in assignments.[7] Additional area code patterns were later assigned for other services; for example, the area codes N10 were implemented for the Teletypewriter Exchange Service (TWX).[28]

Central office codes [ edit ]

It was already common practice for decades that the digits 0 and 1 could not appear in the first two digits of the central office codes, because the system of using the first two letters of familiar names for central offices did not assign letters to these digits. The digit 0 was used for operator assistance, and 1, which is essentially a single pulse of loop interruption, was automatically ignored by most switching equipment of the time.[22] Therefore, the 0/1 rule for the area code provided a convenient means to distinguish seven-digit dialing from ten-digit dialing.

The use of telephone exchange names as part of telephone numbers had been a well-established practice, and this was preserved for convenience and expediency in the new network design. The letter-to-digit translations were printed on the face of every rotary dial in the metropolitan areas, according to a scheme designed by W.G. Blauvelt in 1917, that had been used in the Bell System in large metropolitan areas since the early 1920s.[29] The network reorganization standardized this system to using a two-letter, five-digit (2L-5N) representation of telephone numbers in most exchanges in North America,[30] or to using an equivalent all-numeric seven-digit numbering plans, as was practiced by some telephone companies.

Dialing procedures [ edit ]

The closed numbering plan did not require the subscriber to dial all digits. When making a local call or a call within the same numbering plan area, the area code was omitted in seven-digit dialing. In some cases, even fewer digits sufficed for local calling. Ten-digit dialing was only necessary when making foreign area calls to subscribers in another state or numbering plan area.[31] Exceptions existed for communities on NPA boundaries, so that uniform local dialing was still possible in historically established communities.

All-number calling was a telephone numbering plan introduced in 1958,[33] that converted telephone numbers with exchange names to a numeric representation of seven digits.

The original plan of 1947 had been projected to be usable beyond the year 2000. However, by the late 1950s it became apparent that it would be outgrown by about 1975.[34] The limitations for the usable leading digits of central office codes, imposed by using common names for central office names, and their leading two characters as guides for customer dialing could no longer be maintained when opening new central offices. By 1962 it was forecast that in 1985 the number of telephones in the nation would equal its population of 280 million and increase to 600 million telephones for 340 million people in 2000.[30] As a result, a few North American telephone administrations, notably New York Telephone Co., first introduced letter combinations that could not be associated with a familiar pronounceable central office name. Finally, they sought the elimination of central office names and letter codes, and introduced all-number calling (ANC).

With all-number calling, the number of permissible central office prefixes increased from 540 to potentially 800, but the first two digits of the central office code were still restricted to the range 2 to 9, and the eight combinations that ended in 11 were reserved as special calling codes.[30] This increased the numbering pool for central office codes to 640, and resulted in the partitioning of the prefix space (000—999).[32]

Interchangeable central office codes [ edit ]

As the numbering plan grew during the 1960s using all-number calling, plan administrators at AT&T identified that by c. 1973 some of the largest area codes in urban centers might run out of central office prefixes to install more individual access lines. For relief in these cases, they finally eliminated the requirement that the middle digit of the central office code could not be 0 or 1. This resulted in the format of interchangeable central office codes, N X X, where N=2–9 and X=0–9. The first cities that required this action, in 1974, were the cities of Los Angeles with area code 213 and New York with 212. This change also required modification of the local dialing procedures to distinguish local calls from long-distance calls with area codes.

Requiring 1 to be dialed before the full number in some areas provided for area codes of the form N10, such as 210 in the San Antonio, Texas, area and 410 in eastern Maryland. Therefore, someone calling from San Jose, California, to Los Angeles before the change would have dialed 213-555-0123 and after the change 1-213-555-0123, which permitted the use of 213 as an exchange prefix in the San Jose area. The preceding 1 also ideally indicates a toll call; however, this is inconsistent across the NANP because the FCC has left it to the U.S. state public utilities commissions to regulate for traditional landlines, and it has since become moot for mobile phones and digital VoIP services that offer nationwide calling without the extra digit.[citation needed]

Interchangeable NPA codes [ edit ]

In 1995, the North American Numbering Plan Administrator eliminated the requirement that the middle digit of an area code had to be either 0 or 1, implementing fully interchangeable NPA and central office codes, that had already been anticipated since the 1960s, when interchangeable central office codes were sanctioned.

Modern plan [ edit ]

The NANP numbering format may be summarized in the ten-digit notation NYX NXX-XXXX, where N denotes any of the digits 2–9, Y denotes any of the digits 0-8, and X denotes any digit 0–9.

Component Name Number ranges Notes NYX

often denoted NPA Numbering plan area code The first NYX block is the numbering plan area code. When the second and third digits are the same, the code is an easily recognizable code (ERC). ERCs designate special services; e.g., 800 for toll-free service. The NANP is not assigning area codes with 9 as the second digit.[35] Covers Canada, the United States, parts of the Caribbean Sea, and some Atlantic and Pacific islands. The area code is often enclosed in parentheses. NXX Central office code The second NXX block is the central office code. Permissible numbers exclude easily recognizable codes N11, used for special services. Also called exchange code XXXX Line number A unique four-digit number for each NPA, from 0000 to 9999 Also called station code

Using 0 or 1 as the first digit of an area code or central office code is invalid, as is a 9 as the middle digit of an area code; these are trunk prefixes or reserved for North American Numbering Plan expansion.

For example, 234 235-5678 is a valid telephone number; with area code 234, central office prefix (exchange) 235, and line number 5678. The number 234 911-5678 is invalid, because the central office code must not be in the form N11. 394 259-2653 is invalid, because the NANP is not assigning area codes with 9 as the second digit. 314 159-2653 is invalid, because the office code must not begin with 1. 123 234-5678 is invalid, because the NPA must not begin with 0 or 1.[36][37][38][39]

Each three-digit area code has a capacity of 7,919,900 telephone numbers (7,918,900 in the United States).

Despite the widespread use of fictional telephone numbers of the form NYX 555-XXXX, only the block of line numbers from 0100 through 0199 are reserved specifically for this purpose, leaving the rest available for assignment.

The country code for all countries participating with the NANP is 1. The prefix digit 1 is also used within the NANP for long-distance dialing.

Telephone number formatting [ edit ]

NANP telephone numbers are usually rendered as NPA-NXX-XXXX or (NPA) NXX-XXXX . For example, 250 555 0199, a fictional number, could be rendered as 250-555-0199, (250) 555-0199, 250-5550199, or 250/555-0199. The parentheses were originally used to indicate that the area code was not necessary for local dialing. The Government of Canada's Translation Bureau recommends using hyphens between groups; e.g. 250-555-0199.[40]

Using the global formatting for telephone numbers, per recommendation E.164 by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a NANP number is rendered as +1NPANXXXXXX, without spaces or punctuation, e.g. +12505550199. The plus sign indicates that the user may have to dial another prefix per local dialing conventions in the country of origin that selects a trunk for international network access; the digits immediately following are thus the country code, where 1 is the NANP country code.

Non-geographic services [ edit ]

The North American Numbering Plan recognizes the need for non-geographic services by designating certain numbering blocks for such purposes. Many of these telephone numbers are selected from the easily recognizable codes (ERCs).

System-wide toll-free calling, for which the receiving party is billed for the call, uses the number range with area codes of the form 8XX.

Area code and central office prefixes for other non-geographic services have the form 5XX-NXX. As of January 2021, the codes 500, 521, 522, 533, 544, 566, 577, 588, 523, 524, 525, and 526 have been designated.[41] These codes are used for fixed or mobile devices, and not assigned to rate centers. As addresses, they may or may not traverse the public switched telephone network (PSTN). Applications include the use as personal 500 numbers.

Some carrier-specific services have used area code 700. In Canada, area code 600 is used for non-geographic applications. Area code 900 has been used for high-toll 900 numbers.

Cellular mobile services [ edit ]

The North American Numbering Plan does not reserve special non-geographic area codes exclusively for cellular phones, as is customary in some other national telephone administrations. Only one regional exception exists in area code 600 in Canada.

For cellular services, telephone numbers in the NANP are allocated within each area code from special central office prefixes. Calls to them are billed at the same rate as any other call. Consequently, the caller pays pricing model adopted in other countries, in which calls to cellular phones are charged at a higher nationwide rate, but incoming mobile calls are not charged to the mobile user, could not be implemented. Instead, North American cellular telephone subscribers are also generally charged for receiving calls (subscriber pays). In the past, this has discouraged mobile users from publishing mobile telephone numbers, but by the first decade of the 21st century, most users selected bundle pricing plans that included an allotment of minutes expected to be used in the billing period, and most U.S. carriers since offer unlimited calling plans at mass-market prices.[42]

Industry observers have attributed the relatively low mobile phone penetration rate in the United States, compared to that of Europe, to the subscriber-pays model.[citation needed] In this model the convenience of the mobility is charged to the subscriber. Callers from outside the local-calling region of the assigned number, however, pay for a long-distance call, although domestic long-distance rates are generally lower than the rates in caller-pays systems. Conversely, an early advantage of caller-pays was the relative absence of telemarketing and nuisance calls to mobile numbers, although this advantage dwindled as robocallers found ways to reduce to zero the marginal cost of each call placed. The integrated numbering plan also enables local number portability between fixed and wireless services within a region, allowing users to switch to mobile service while keeping their telephone number.

The initial plan for area code overlays did allow for providing separate area codes for use by mobile devices, although these were still assigned to a specific geographical area, and were charged at the same rate as other area codes. Initially, the area code 917 for New York City was specifically assigned for this purpose within the boroughs; however, a Federal court ended the practice and the use of an area code for a specific telephony purpose.[citation needed] Since mobile telephony has been expanding faster than landline use, new area codes typically have a disproportionately large fraction of mobile and nomadic numbers, although landline and other services rapidly follow and local network portability can blur these distinctions.

Growth [ edit ]

Canada and the United States have experienced rapid growth in the number of area codes, particularly between 1990 and 2005. The widespread adoption of fax, modem, and mobile phone communication, as well as the deregulation of local telecommunication services in the United States during the mid-1990s, increased the demand for telephone numbers.

The Federal Communications Commission allowed telecommunication companies to compete with the incumbent local exchange carriers for services, usually by forcing the existing sole service provider to lease infrastructure to other local providers. Because of the original design of the numbering plan and the telephone switching network that assumed only a single provider, number allocations had to be made in 10,000-number blocks even when many fewer numbers were required for each new vendor. Due to the proliferation of service providers in some numbering plan areas, many area codes were threatened with exhaustion of numbering resources. The number blocks of failed service providers often remained unused, as no regulatory mechanism existed to reclaim and reassign these numbers.

Area codes are added by two principal methods, number plan area splits and overlays. Splits were implemented by dividing an area into two or more regions, one of which retained the existing area code and the other areas receiving a new code. In an overlay, multiple codes are assigned to the same geographical area, obviating the need for renumbering of existing services. Subtle variations of these techniques have been used as well, such as dedicated overlays, in which the new code is reserved for a particular type of service, such as cellular phones and pagers, and concentrated overlays, in which a part of the area retained a single code while the rest of the region received an overlay code. The only service-specific overlay in the NANP was area code 917 (New York City) when it was first installed; such service-specific area code assignments were later prohibited by the Federal Communications Commission.

Most area codes of the form N10, originally reserved for AT&T's Teletypewriter eXchange (TWX) service, were transferred to Western Union in 1969 and were freed for other use in 1981 after conversion to Telex II service was complete. The last of these, 610, was assigned to Canada, but reassigned in 1992. These new area codes, as well as a few other codes used for routing calls to Mexico, were used for telephone area code splits during the late 1980s and early 1990s, as all other area codes using the original plan had been consumed.

After the remaining valid area codes were used up by expansion, in 1995 the rapid increase in the need for more area codes forced the NANPA to allow the digits 2 through 8 to be used as a middle digit in new area code assignments, with 9 being reserved as a last resort for potential future expansion. At the same time, local exchanges were allowed to use 1 or 0 as a middle digit. The first area codes without a 1 or 0 as the middle digit were area code 334 in Alabama and area code 360 in Washington, which both began service on January 15, 1995. This was followed quickly by area code 520 serving Arizona on March 19, 1995.

By 1995, many cities in the United States and Canada had more than one area code, either from dividing a city into different areas (NPA split) or having more than one code for the same area (NPA overlay). The overlay method requires that the area code must be dialed in all cases, even for local calls, while the split plan may permit seven-digit dialing within the same area. The transition to ten-digit dialing typically starts with a permissive dialing phase, which is widely publicized, during which dialing all ten digits is optional. After a period of several months, mandatory dialing begins, when seven-digit dialing is no longer permissible. Atlanta was the first U.S. city to require mandatory ten-digit dialing throughout the metropolitan area, coinciding roughly with the 1996 Summer Olympics held there. Atlanta was used as the test case not only because of its size, but also because it had the world's largest fiber-optic network at the time, five times larger than that of New York, and it was home to BellSouth (now part of AT&T), then the Southeastern Regional Bell Operating Company, with AT&T's fiber optics manufacturing facility within the city.

Growth problems [ edit ]

Depending on the techniques used for area code and central office code relief, the effect on telephone users varies. In areas in which overlays were used, this generally avoids the need for converting telephone numbers, so existing directories, business records, letterheads, business cards, advertising, and ""speed-dialing"" settings can retain the same telephone numbers, while the overlay is used for new number allocations. The primary effect on telephone users is the necessity of remembering and dialing ten-digit numbers when only seven-digit dialing was previously needed.

Dividing numbering plan areas instead of overlaying generally avoids the requirement for mandatory area code dialing within the new regions, but at the expense of having to convert a region to the new code, which necessitates updating records and directories to accommodate the new numbers. A transition period prior to splitting provides a period of ""permissive dialing"" during which seven-digit dialing is still permitted. Also, many splits involved significant technical issues, considering municipal boundaries and tributary trunking arrangements.

As an example, in 1998, the area code 612, assigned to the Minneapolis – Saint Paul Twin Cities, was divided to create area code 651 for St. Paul and the eastern metropolitan area. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission mandated that the new boundary exactly follow municipal boundaries, which were distinctly different from telephone exchange boundaries, and that all subscribers keep their seven-digit numbers. These two goals were directly at odds with the reason for the division, namely to provide additional telephone numbers. More than forty exchanges had territory that straddled the new boundary. As a result, prefixes were duplicated in both area codes, which counteracted much of the benefit of the division, with only 200 of 700 prefixes in area 612 transferring entirely to area 651. In less than two years, area code 612 again exhausted its supply of telephone numbers, and necessitated a three-way division in 2000, creating the new area codes 763 and 952. The division again followed political boundaries, rather than rate center boundaries, resulting in additional split prefixes; a few numbers were transferred from 612 to 651 to 763 in less than two years.

Decrease of growth rate [ edit ]

Recognizing that the proliferation of area codes was due largely to the telecom deregulation act and the assignment of numbers in blocks of ten thousand, the FCC instructed NANPA, by then administered by Neustar, to alleviate the numbering shortage. As a result, number pooling was piloted in 2001 as a system for allocating local numbers to carriers in blocks of 1,000 rather than 10,000. Because of the then design of the switched telephone network, this was a considerable technical obstacle. Number pooling was implemented with another technical obstacle, local number portability.

The program has been implemented in much of the United States by state regulators. Some cities have also implemented rate center consolidation; fewer rate centers resulted in more efficient use of telephone numbers, as carriers would reserve blocks of 1,000 or 10,000 numbers in each of multiple rate centers in the same area even if they had relatively few clients in the area.[43] (A rate center is a geographical area used by a Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) to determine the boundaries for local calling, billing and assigning phone numbers. Typically a call within a rate center is local, while a call from one rate center to another is a long-distance call.) Together with aggressive reclamation of unused number blocks from telecom providers, number pooling has reduced the need for additional area codes, so that many previously designated area splits and overlays have been postponed indefinitely.

Canada never implemented number pooling, so that even the smallest villages are rate centers and every Competitive local exchange carrier (CLEC) is assigned blocks of ten thousand numbers.

New area codes outside the contiguous United States and Canada [ edit ]

Before 1995, all NANP countries and territories outside the contiguous United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Canada shared the area code 809. This included Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Each has since been assigned one or more distinct numbering plan areas; area code 809 exclusively serves the Dominican Republic (along with area codes 829 and 849). The United States Pacific territories of the Northern Mariana Islands and Guam joined the NANP in 1997, and American Samoa became an NANP member in October 2004. The Dutch possession of Sint Maarten was originally scheduled to join the NANP on May 31, 2010, but the changeover was postponed to September 30, 2011.[13]

Bermuda before 1995: served by area code 809 1995: assigned area code 441 Puerto Rico before 1996: served by area code 809 1996: assigned area code 787

2001: overlaid with area code 939 U.S. Virgin Islands before 1997: served by area code 809 1997: assigned area code 340 Northern Marianas before 1997: reached via IDDD using country code 670 1997: assigned area code 670 Guam before 1997: reached via IDDD using country code 671 1997: assigned area code 671 American Samoa before October 1, 2004: reached via IDDD using country code 684 2004: assigned area code 684 Sint Maarten before September 30, 2011: reached via IDDD using country code 599 2011: assigned area code 721

Telephone number length expansion [ edit ]

The NANP exhaust analysis estimates that the existing numbering system is sufficient beyond 2049, based on the assumptions that a maximum of 674 NPAs continue to be available, and that on average 3,990 central office codes are needed per year.[44]

In case of exhaustion, various plans are discussed for expanding the numbering plan. One option is to add the digit 1 or 0 either at the beginning or at the end of the area code, or prefixing it to the seven-digit subscriber number. This would require eleven-digit dialing even for local calls between any two NANP numbers. Another proposal introduces the digit 9 into the area code in the format x9xx, so that, for example, San Francisco's 415 would become 4915. Other proposals include reallocating blocks of numbers assigned to smaller long-distance carriers or unused reserved services.[citation needed]

Dialing procedures [ edit ]

The structure of the North American Numbering Plan permits implementation of local dial plans in each plan area, depending on requirements. When multiple NPA codes serve an area in an overlay arrangement, ten-digit (10D) dialing is required. Seven-digit (7D) dialing may be permissible in areas with single area codes.[45] Depending on the requirement of toll alerting, it may be necessary to prefix a telephone number with 1. The NANPA publishes dial plan information for individual area codes.[46]

The standard dial plans in most cases:

Local within area code Local outside area code Toll within area code Toll outside area code Single code area, with toll alerting 7D or 10D 7D or 10D 1+10D 1+10D Single code area, without toll alerting 7D or 10D 1+10D 7D or 10D 1+10D Overlaid area, with toll alerting 10D 10D 1+10D 1+10D Overlaid area, without toll alerting 10D 1+10D 10D 1+10D

The number of digits dialed is unrelated to being a local call or a toll call when there is no toll alerting. Allowing 7D local dialing across an area code boundary, which is rare today, requires central office code protection, locally if using toll alerting, across the entire area code otherwise, to avoid assignment of the same seven-digit number on both sides. Landlines occasionally require 1+10D where 10D is required, most notably in California.

Most areas permit local calls as 1+10D except for Texas, Georgia, and some jurisdictions in Canada which require that landline callers know which numbers are local and which are toll, dialing 10D for local calls and 1+10D for all toll calls.

In almost all cases, domestic operator-assisted calls are dialed 0+10D.

Special numbers and codes [ edit ]

Some common special numbers in the North American system:

Vertical service codes are used for special calling features, such as:

*51 and 1151 — a history of unanswered calls on a telephone number, useful for those who are not Caller ID subscribers

*57 and 1157 — used to trace harassing, threatening, abusive, obscene, etc. phone calls, and keep results of trace at phone company

*66 and 1166 — to keep retrying a busy-line (see also Called-party camp-on)

*67 and 1167 — Caller ID Block

*69 and 1169 — Call Return (caller may press '1' to return call after hearing number)

*70 and 1170 — cancel call waiting on a call-by-call basis

*71 and 1171 — three-way calling, which lets a person talk to people in two different locations at the same time

*74 and 1174 — speed dial, which allows someone to quickly dial any of eight frequently called numbers using a one-digit code, from any phone on their line

*75 — allows a total of 30 speed-call numbers with two digits

*77 — activates Anonymous Call Rejection Service

*82 and 1182 — releases Caller ID block on a call-by-call basis

*87 — deactivates Anonymous Call Rejection Service

The four-digit numbers are not implemented in some areas. The star codes (*) are for use on Touch-Tone telephones, whereas the four-digit numbers prefixed 11xx are used on rotary dial telephones which cannot dial the * symbol.

Not all NANP countries use the same codes. For example, the emergency telephone number is not always 911: Trinidad and Tobago and Dominica use 999, as in the United Kingdom. The country of Barbados uses 211 for police force, 311 for fire, and 511 for ambulance, while Jamaica uses 114 for directory assistance, 119 for police force, and 110 for fire and ambulance services.

Despite its early importance as a share of the worldwide telephone system, few of the NANP's codes, such as 911, have been adopted outside the system. Determining that 911 requires unnecessary rotation time on rotary dial telephones, the European Union has adopted its own standardized number of 112, while countries in Asia and the rest of the world use a variety of other two- or three-digit emergency telephone number combinations. The 112 code is gaining prevalence because of its preprogrammed presence in mobile telephones that conform to the European GSM standard. The European Union and many other countries have chosen the International Telecommunication Union's 00 as their international access number instead of 011. However, the toll-free prefix 800 has been adopted widely elsewhere, including as the international toll-free country code. It is often preceded by a 0 rather than a 1 in many countries where 0 is the trunk prefix.

International dialing [ edit ]

While direct dialing of international calls was available in some locations in the United States by the late 1950s, a continental system was introduced as International Direct Distance Dialing (IDDD) for the territories of the North American Numbering Plan in March 1970.[49]

IDDD was implemented through extensive modifications in the switching systems to accommodate the international open numbering plan with seven to twelve digits in the national telephone numbers.[50] Access to the international network is facilitated by the dialing prefix 011, after which the country code and the national telephone number are dialed.

Number portability [ edit ]

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 (47 U.S.C. § 251 (b)(2)) authorizes the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to require all local exchange carriers (LECs) to offer local number portability.[51] The FCC regulations were enacted on June 27, 1996, with changes to take effect in the one hundred largest Metropolitan Statistical Areas by October 1, 1997, and elsewhere by December 31, 1998.[52]

The FCC directed the North American Numbering Council (NANC) to select one or more private-sector candidates for the local number portability administrator (LNPA) function,[53] in a manner akin to the selection of the North American Numbering Plan Administrator (NANPA).[54]

The toll-free telephone numbers in NPA 800, 888, 877, 866, 855, 844, and 833 have been portable through the RespOrg system since 1993.[55]

Toll charges [ edit ]

Telephone calls between countries and territories of the NANP are not typically charged at domestic rates. For example, most long-distance plans may charge a California subscriber a higher rate for a call to British Columbia than for a call to New York, even though both destinations are within the NANP. Similarly, calls from Bermuda to U.S. destinations incur international rates. Even toll-free numbers may incur charges to callers. This is because many of the island nations implemented a plan of subsidizing the cost of local telephone services by directly charging higher pricing levies on international long-distance services.[citation needed]

Because of these higher fees, scams had taken advantage of customers' unfamiliarity with pricing to call the legacy regional area code 809. Some scams lured customers from the United States and Canada into placing expensive calls to the Caribbean, by representing area code 809 as a regular domestic, low-cost, or toll-free call. The split of 809 (which formerly served all of the Caribbean NANP points) into multiple new area codes created many new, unfamiliar prefixes which could be mistaken for U.S. or Canada domestic area codes but carried high tariffs. In various island nations, premium exchanges such as +1-876-HOT-, +1-876-WET- or +1-876-SEX- (where 876 is Jamaica) became a means to circumvent consumer-protection laws governing area code 900 or similar U.S.-domestic premium numbers.

The occurrence of these scams has been decreasing, with many of the Cable and Wireless service monopolies being opened to competition, hence decreasing rates. Additionally, many Caribbean territories have implemented local government agencies to regulate telecommunications rates of providers.[56][57]

Countries and territories [ edit ]

Of all states or territories, the U.S. state of California has the largest number of area codes assigned, followed by Texas, Florida and New York, while most countries of the Caribbean use only one.[58] Many Caribbean codes were assigned based on alphabetic abbreviations of the territory name, as indicated in the third column of the following table (Letter code). This follows the traditional letter assignments on telephone dials. For some Pacific islands, the NANPA area code is the same as the country code that was discontinued upon membership in the NANP.

While the United States and Canada generate substantial amounts of the tourists for the Caribbean, and are usually among the main international dialing destinations,[citation needed] most of the Caribbean was incorporated because companies such as Contel acquired Caribbean telecom systems following political independence from the United Kingdom.[1] Membership in the NANP still allows visitors between these countries to use familiar dialing procedures without international access codes. Although NANP allows businesses within the member country to use the toll-free number system, most toll-free numbers to the United States and Canada remain barred from in the Caribbean unless paid as a toll call.

Alphabetic mnemonic system [ edit ]

Digit Letters Letters of the alphabet are mapped to the digits of the telephone dial pad. 2 ABC 3 DEF 4 GHI 5 JKL 6 MNO 7 P(Q)RS 8 TUV 9 WXY(Z)

Despite the abandonment of telephone exchange names in telephone numbering plans, many telephone dials and keypads maintain a tradition of alphabetic dialing. Pushbuttons from digit 2 to 9 also displays letters, which is standardized in ISO 9995-8 and, in Europe, E.161. The alphabet is apportioned to the buttons as shown in the table.

The Glenn Miller tune PEnnsylvania 6-5000 refers to telephone number PE6-5000, a number in service at the Hotel Pennsylvania (212 736-5000) in New York City until the hotel's closing in 2020. Similarly, the movie BUtterfield 8 is set in the East Side of Manhattan between roughly 64th and 86th Streets, where the telephone prefixes include 288.

The letter system was phased out, beginning before 1965, although it persisted ten years later in some places. It was included in Bell of Pennsylvania directories until 1983. Some businesses still display a 2L-5N number in advertisements, e.g., the Belvedere Construction Company in Detroit, Michigan not only still uses the 2L-5N format for its number (TYler 8-7100), it uses the format for the toll-free number (1-800-TY8-7100).

Despite the phasing out of the letter system, alphabetic phonewords remain as a commercial mnemonic gimmick, particularly for toll-free numbers. For example, one can dial 1-800-FLOWERS to order flowers, or 1-800-DENTIST to find a local dentist.

In addition to uses in advertising, alphabetic dialing has occasionally influenced the selection of area codes. For example, when area code 423 (East Tennessee) was split in 1999, the region surrounding Knoxville was assigned area code 865, chosen to represent VOL, for The Volunteer State, the nickname of Tennessee, as well as athletic teams at the University of Tennessee.[60][61] Similarly, several Caribbean area codes were chosen as an alphabetic abbreviation of the name of the country or its capital.

Fictional telephone numbers [ edit ]

American television programs and movies often use the central office code 555, or KLamath 5 and KLondike 5 in older movies and shows, for fictitious telephone numbers, to prevent disturbing actual telephone subscribers if anyone is tempted to dial a telephone number seen or referred to on screen. Not all numbers beginning with 555 are fictional. For example, 555-1212 is the standard number for directory assistance. Only 555-0100 through 555-0199 are reserved for fictional use. Where used, these are often routed to information services; Canadian telephone companies briefly promoted 555-1313 as a pay-per-use ""name that number"" reverse lookup during the mid-1990s.[62]

Occasionally, valid telephone numbers are used as song titles. The 1962 Motown hit ""Beechwood 4-5789"" was written by Marvin Gaye for The Marvelettes, while Stax/Volt Records' Wilson Pickett scored a soul music success during the 1960s with the similarly named ""634-5789"". A more recent example is the 1981 song ""867-5309/Jenny"" by Tommy Tutone, which was the cause of a large number of prank calls.[63]

228,Office Building | WBDG,https://www.wbdg.org/building-types/office-building,Автор: B Conway,"Overview

The office building is a very tangible reflection of a profound change in employment patterns that occurred over the last one hundred years. In the U.S., northern Europe, and Japan, at least 50 percent of the working population is employed in office settings as compared to 5 percent of the population at the beginning of the 20th century. However, today's office buildings are experiencing even more change due to the recent pandemic. The office is now a place for collaboration, talent recruitment, onboarding, and inspiration with new requirements and expectations that combine physical spaces with technologically supported ways to work, in the office or remotely.

Typically, the life-cycle cost distribution for a typical service organization is about 3 to 4 percent for the facility, 4 percent for operations, 1 percent for furniture, and 90 to 91 percent for salaries. As such, if the office structure can leverage the 3 to 4 percent expenditure on facilities to improve the productivity of the workplace, it can have a very dramatic effect on personnel contributions representing 90 to 91 percent of the service organization's costs.

To accomplish this objective, the office building must benefit from an integrated design approach that focuses on meeting a list of design objectives. Through integrated design, high-performance office buildings offers owners and users increased worker satisfaction and productivity, improved health, greater flexibility, and enhanced energy and environmental performance. Typically, these projects apply life-cycle analysis to optimize initial investments in architectural design, systems selection, and building construction.

Building Attributes

An office building must have flexible and technologically-advanced working environments that are safe, healthy, comfortable, durable, aesthetically-pleasing, sustainable, and accessible. It must be able to accommodate the specific space and equipment needs of the tenant. Special attention should be made to the selection of interior finishes and art installations, particularly in entry spaces, conference rooms and other areas with public access.

A. Types of Spaces

An office building incorporates a number of space types to meet the needs of staff and visitors. These may include:

Offices

Offices: May be private or semi-private acoustically and/or visually.

Conference Rooms

Employee/Visitor Support Spaces

Administrative Support Spaces

Administrative Offices: May be private or semi-private acoustically and/or visually.

Operation and Maintenance Spaces

General Storage: For items such as stationery, equipment, and instructional materials.

Food Preparation Area or Kitchen

Computer/Information Technology (IT) Closets or data processing areas. See WBDG Automated Data Processing: PC System related information.

Maintenance Closets

B. Important Design Considerations

Typical features of Office Buildings include the list of applicable design objectives elements as outlined below. For a complete list and definitions of the design objectives within the context of whole building design, click on the titles below.

The ADA requires that all new construction of places of public accommodation, as well as of commercial facilities such as office buildings, be accessible. The ADA Standards for Accessible Design set minimum requirements—both scoping and technical—for newly designed and constructed or altered public accommodations and commercial facilities to be readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities. Several of the key elements are outlined below. However, it is important to utilize the full standard to determine all requirements.

Accessible Parking, Entrances, and Routes : Office buildings should have accessible parking, entrances, and accessible routes within the spaces that can accommodate persons with various disabilities, including wheelchairs. Office furniture should be placed a minimum of 32"" from walls and other obstructions to allow for smooth wheelchair passages. Allow 60"" clearance so wheelchairs can rotate and turn around corners.

Accessible Countertops and Work Stations : Accommodate different employee needs through the use of standing and/or adjustable desks, and work surfaces and countertops that are modifiable. Desks should be 24–36"" high. Standard desks are usually 30"" high. Employees should not have to reach any higher than 48"" and no lower than 15"". When an employee needs to reach to the side, items should be no higher than 54"" and no lower than 9"". Incorporate Universal Design principles to achieve a design that works for all whenever possible.

Assistive Technology : Plan for employees with disabilities who require special assistive technology, as well as employees who use a large amount of technology that is not portable.

Toilet Rooms and Bathing Spaces: Provide accessible toilet rooms and bathing spaces as defined and required by the ADA.

Planning : When planning the exterior and interiors of an office building, create a building design and spaces that businesses and people want to work in. Aesthetics are extremely significant to both morale and productivity within the workplace. The office building should also be planned to accommodate changes in use or work flow.

Overall Aesthetics: Utilize color, pattern, and texture in the building to create an inviting and safe environment. Furnishings, finishes, and artwork should reflect the nature of the work within the building and be well taken care of and provide supportive and comfortable environments. Provide access to views and nature whenever possible to improve the quality of the work environment. Provide aesthetically pleasing individual work spaces and storage. Encourage some personalizing of space, but eliminate clutter to reduce distractions and work hazards.

The high-performance office should be evaluated using life-cycle economic and material evaluation models. Owners need to understand that optimizing building performance requires a willingness to invest more initially to save on long-term operations and maintenance costs.

To achieve the optimum performance for the investment in the facility, value engineering provides a means for assessing the performance versus cost of each design element and building component. In the design phase building development, properly applied value engineering considers alternative design solutions to optimize the expected cost/worth ratio of projects at completion. Value engineering elicits ideas on ways of maintaining or enhancing results while reducing life-cycle costs. In the construction phase, contractors are encouraged through shared savings to draw on their special 'know-how' to propose changes that cut costs while maintaining or enhancing quality, value, and functional performance. For more information on value-engineering, see WBDG Cost-Effective—Utilize Cost and Value Engineering Throughout the Project Life Cycle.

Tenant Requirements: The building design must consider the integrated requirements of the intended tenants. This includes their desired image, degree of public access, operating hours, growth demands, security issues, and vulnerability assessment results, organization and group sizes, growth potential, long-term consistency of need, group assembly requirements, electronic equipment and technology requirements, acoustical requirements, special floor loading and filing/storage requirements, special utility services, any material handling or operational process flows, special health hazards, use of vehicles and types of vehicles used, and economic objectives.

Office layouts have become more open, supporting opportunities for easy collaboration, access to technology, and healthy settings that include natural daylight and views.

Flexibility

The high-performance office must easily and economically accommodate frequent renovation and alteration, sometimes referred to as ""churn."" These modifications may be due to management reorganization, personnel shifts, changes in business models, or technological innovations, but the office infrastructure, interior systems, and furnishings must be up to the challenge.

Consider raised floors to allow for easy access to cabling and power distribution, as well as advanced air distribution capabilities to address individual occupant comfort.

Incorporate features such as plug-and-play floor boxes for power, data, voice and fiber, modular and harnessed wiring and buses, and conferencing hubs to allow for daily flexibility at work as well as future reorganization of office workstations.

Plan for the hybrid office model to allow some employees to work in the office, while others may remain working remotely. Distanced layouts, separated cubicles, more personal space, contactless pathways, one-way hallways, distanced desks, disposable surface protectors, and signage to direct the flow of employees and visitors are elements of hybrid office design.

The concentration of a large number of workers within one building can have a significant impact on surrounding areas and neighborhoods. Office structures can vitalize neighborhoods with the retail, food service, and interrelated business links the office brings to the neighborhood. Consideration of transportation issues must also be given when developing office structures. Office buildings are often impacted by urban planning and municipal zoning, which attempt to promote compatible land use and vibrant neighborhoods.

Consider previously developed sites or brownfield sites for the development of a new office building to reduce the impact on land use and natural habitats. Also, consider existing buildings that can be retrofitted to reduce the use of resources needed to create a new building while also minimizing the disturbance of new sites.

When selecting office locations, consideration should be given to the travel distance the majority of occupants will have to reach the office. Studies including zip code origination should be conducted to determine the best location for the office. The development of new office locations may necessitate relocation of employees, particularly if the office is moved or opened in a new geographical area. Consideration of the municipal resources should include housing costs and availability, traffic congestion, school system quality, cultural resources such as museums, sports teams, and institutions of higher education, natural attractions such as coastal, riverfront, and lakefront areas, mountains, and public parks, availability of educated labor, crime rate and law enforcement, and civic infrastructure capacity such as water, waste water, and waste processing.

Once a building has been constructed and occupied, it is critical that long-term performance be optimized through an aggressive process of metering, monitoring, and reporting. The results of this feedback should inform maintenance operations and be available as input to new design efforts.

Worker Satisfaction, Health, and Comfort: In office environments, the single greatest cost to employers is the salaries of the employees occupying the space. It generally exceeds the lease and energy costs of a facility by a factor of ten on a square foot basis. For this reason, the health, safety, and comfort of employees in a high-performance office are of paramount concern.

Utilize strategies such as increased natural ventilation rates, the specification of non-toxic and low-polluting materials and systems, and indoor air quality monitoring.

Provide individualized climate control that permits users to set their own, localized temperature, ventilation rate, and air movement preferences.

It is widely accepted that worker satisfaction and performance increases when office workers are provided stimulating, dynamic working environments. Access to windows and views, opportunities for interaction, and control of one's immediate environment are some of the factors that contribute to improved workplace satisfaction. See also the Psychosocial Value of Space.

Natural light is important to the health and psychological well-being of office workers. The design of office environments must place emphasis on providing each occupant with access to natural light and views to the outside. A minimum of 30 foot candles per square foot of diffused indirect natural light is desirable.

The acoustical environment of the office must be designed and integrated with the other architectural systems and furnishings of the office. Special consideration must be given to noise control in open office settings, with absorptive finish materials, masking white noise, and sufficient separation of individual occupants.

Technical Connectivity

Technology is an indispensable tool for business, industry, and education. Given that technology is driving a variety of changes in the organizational and architectural forms of office buildings, consider the following issues when incorporating it, particularly information technology (IT), into an office:

Plan new office buildings to have a distributed, robust, and flexible IT infrastructure, which allows technological access in virtually all spaces.

During the planning stage, identify all necessary technological systems (e.g., voice/cable/data systems such as audio/visual systems, speaker systems, Internet access, and Local Area Networks [LAN] / Wide-Area Networks [WAN] / Wireless Fidelity [WI-FI]), and provide adequate equipment rooms and conduit runs for them.

Consider and accommodate wireless technologies, as appropriate.

Combine smart building technologies, smartphone apps, and wearable sensors to transform the post-pandemic workplace into much safer spaces. Data can also be captured from these technologies to optimize the spaces and make them more convenient for users.

For existing office buildings, improve access to the IT infrastructure as renovations are undertaken.

See WBDG Productive—Design for the Changing Workplace and Productive—Integrate Technological Tools for more information about incorporating IT into facility design.

Office building security begins at the site perimeter or property line. This includes planning for access to the site, parking, walkways, and security elements that protect the building during the day and at night. Focus the design on protection of occupants and assets against manmade attacks as well as natural hazards. Through comprehensive threat assessment, vulnerability assessment, and risk analysis, security requirements for individual buildings are identified, and appropriate reasonable design responses are identified for integration into the office building design.

Consider entrances that do not face uncontrolled vantage points with direct lines of sight to the entrance. Utilize site barriers and setbacks, perimeter barriers and blast resistance, access control, and intrusion detection, entrance screening, package screening and control, open areas that allow for easy visual detection by occupants, and minimized glazing. See WBDG Secure / Safe—Security for Building Occupants and Assets.

First-time visitors, unfamiliar with their surroundings, may have trouble navigating the safest exit route from the building. Consider using increased signage and/or providing safety information and a building directory in welcome brochures. Also, review and evaluate safety plans on a regular basis. See WBDG Secure / Safe—Fire Protection and Secure / Safe—Occupant Safety and Health.

Utilize CPTED principles to proactively design security into the project without compromising aesthetics, but that also provide cost savings, improved quality of life for building users, and decreased loss and liability.

C. Example Design and Construction Criteria

For GSA, the unit costs for this building type are based on the construction quality and design features in the following table . This information is based on GSA's benchmark interpretation and could be different for other owners.

Emerging Issues

Modernization

The extensive inventory of facilities that are over 25 years of age present a significant recapitalization challenge as well as an opportunity. For GSA, its First Impressions Program addresses the quality of the entrance and lobby areas of its older facility portfolio. Key areas of concern for modernization include upgrading the exterior envelope, mechanical systems, telecommunications infrastructure, security, and interior finishes. Improving the workplace quality, energy performance, security, flexibility to accommodate tenant churn, maintenance overhead, and life-cycle expectancy are important objectives for modernizing these facilities. Appropriate preservation for buildings on or eligible to be on the historic registry is part of the modernization effort.

With the continuation of improved building technologies and controls it is crucial that high-performance buildings are properly commissioned as part of a comprehensive quality assurance plan. In many instances, a process of ongoing commissioning has shown to be effective.

Some federal agencies and private institutions are moving aggressively in the direction of mandating commissioning for all high-performance structures in their portfolios.

This Federal Building in San Francisco, California earned LEED Silver from the USGBC. The building's shape and orientation maximize natural airflow for cooling and ventilation and take advantage of natural daylight for the majority of the open office interiors.

Like any departmental process, the best way to approach move management is by getting your ducks in a row. In most cases, this would mean getting C-suite executives, HR representatives, IT teams, and other key stakeholders involved as well, as all these teams need to answer some baseline questions before the process begins. These can include:

Is there a clear business reason for undertaking this move?

What are the potential benefits and repercussions of a move?

What are the company’s immediate priorities in the next quarter?

What are the long-term goals of the organization?

Does this move align with company objectives?

Once everyone agrees on the larger purpose and objectives of a move, it’s also important to look at the finer details. Some questions to ask are:

How will employees be impacted by the move?

How easy will it be to get employee buy-in?

What factors will be used to determine who sits where?

Is this a good opportunity to perhaps revisit your seating philosophy?

How (and for how long) will the move impact employees’ ongoing projects and daily work?

What does “success” look like? What metric will the organization be looking at to decide whether or not the move was successful?

There are countless elements to an office move that requires careful deliberation and planning, but as an initial step, facility managers and workplace directors should prioritize clear and open communication with other departments and staff. It’s crucial to make sure that the majority agrees that the move aligns with the larger goals and direction of the company and that it will have a positive impact over the long term. While FMs might not be the ultimate decision makers, they can help drive decisions and conversations by listening to different employees and departments and making sure that all concerns are flagged.

Once you’ve received sign-off that an office move should indeed take place, you’ll need to create a detailed timeline and action plan ahead of the move date. Such a plan involves negotiating with stakeholders to ensure the proposed move is structured in a way that best suits all teams. After the facilities team has finalized the timeline and action plan, the next step is to examine the granular details. It’s important to consider all the minutiae that comes with an office move: facility managers need to look at the number and locations of electric plugs, the sizes and positions of desks, and the ratio of employees to bathroom and kitchen facilities. Again, it’s crucial to communicate with other departments—especially IT and HR teams—to make sure that no small detail is left unexamined. The more planning and preparation that is done ahead of the actual move date, the easier the execution will be.

Another important part of planning is looking at current data and figuring out how it can be used to inform and improve the way office space is utilized. Your IWMS can provide great insights into inefficiencies that currently exist and help your teams overcome these challenges in the new office environment. For example, space utilization reports can give a clear idea of areas that aren’t currently being used to their full potential. Sensor technology can even be used to understand exactly how employees are using various office areas. Why are a relatively small number of desks occupying a large open area? Does the company really need such a large boardroom on the second floor? Why are employees avoiding certain areas or desks? By answering these questions, FMs not only increase the chances of an upcoming move being a success, but they also ensure that past mistakes aren’t repeated. A large-scale move is a massive undertaking, so it’s important to make the most of it and leave nothing to chance.

Sensors, AR and VR can all be used to help plan a move, but scenario-based strategizing through a comprehensive move management solution is the single best way to remove assumptions from the equation. Sophisticated software allows the facility manager or workplace director to create hypothetical floor plans based on existing data, which can be shared with IT, HR and other teams to create a floor plan that works best.

620,Office Move Master Plan - Guide for a Successful ...,https://www.allpointsoftexas.com/moving-tips-and-resources/office-move-master-plan/,,"How to Plan an Office Move With Help From All Points of Texas

Anyone who has ever planned an office move could tell you how exhilarating and overwhelming it may feel throughout the process. Most people don’t want to think about anything until after the move’s been completed and everyone’s working in the shiny, brand-new office. However, there are various components of the move that you must plan to ensure a smooth transition for everyone involved. As a full-service moving company, All Points of Texas specializes in home and office moves. Below, our commercial movers share invaluable advice about planning your next office move.

What You Should Do During the Planning Phase (6-12 Months)

Ideally, you should begin planning your office move at least 6-12 months in advance. This will give you ample time to organize every detail, including the following:

Centralize All Moving Documents in One Convenient Place

During the planning phase, you’ll want to organize all information pertaining to the office move in one convenient place. This will allow you to create a timeline for your move with to-do lists and notes. Whether you prefer storing everything in a physical binder with printouts or as digital documents on Google Drive, the idea is to centralize everything so that nothing slips through the cracks. You’ll want to keep all moving company contracts, agreements, insurance records, receipts, and other essential documents together for easy access. It also helps to create one separate email address for all move-related inquiries and ongoing correspondences with employees, customers, or vendors.

Establish a Moving Budget and Contact Commercial Movers

Once an office move has been decided, your company’s leaders will need to establish a moving budget and other guidelines. Will a company credit card be used to pay all moving-related expenses, or will human resources or department heads need to submit invoices? Who must approve vendor contracts? This will help you determine who needs to add purchases and vendor negotiations to their to-do lists.

Once you’ve figured out who is responsible for purchasing decisions, you’ll want to begin contacting commercial movers for a quote. You’ll need to provide the movers with your moving dates, employee headcounts, and other logistics. Be sure to compare and contrast moving rates, also figuring in a company’s credentials, resources, and reviews. You may need to do a bit of research when deciding which local or long-distance mover is best for your company’s relocation needs. Check out these helpful tips on How to Choose a Moving Company for additional info from our expert office movers.

Announce Your Office Move to Employees as Early as Possible

Start getting your employees excited about the office move as early as possible. Announce it in your company’s next newsletter or town hall presentation. Discuss the office move comprehensively, answering questions and addressing concerns. The more detailed you can be about the move and to-do lists, the better. Your employees will all be on the same page and feel more motivated about completing their office move checklists before the big day. Key items to include in your announcement include:

Moving times and dates

New office address and directions

Key features of the new location

Reason for the relocation from your CEO

What you expect from your employees right now

What you expect from your employees during the move

Hold Small Discussion Groups to Get Employee Feedback

Be transparent with your employees during the planning phase. Communicate essential information often, send out employee feedback surveys, and organize small discussion groups to get an idea of what your employees’ concerns are before moving day. Should the new office have a private or open floor plan? What type of workstations do your employees prefer? Are they satisfied with traditional office cubicles, or are they interested in modern standing desks? Will you be transferring all office equipment with you or ordering new equipment once you get there? Be sure to devise a new seating arrangement, considering which teams prefer to sit near each other for collaborative purposes. Identify any issues your employees may have with packing, organizing, or carrying heavy boxes.

Evaluate What You Have & Don’t Have for Your Office Move

No matter the size of your office or employee headcount, you’ll need to decide what’s being taken to the new location and what’s being tossed. A detailed inventory list will help ensure nothing is left behind or unaccounted for during the big move. Be sure to check every nook and cranny, including the breakroom cabinets and supply closets. Consider your existing floor plan versus the new one. Are your new kitchen and breakroom twice the size of the current ones? You may need to order new items.

Establish a Moving Day Strategy With Managers & Employees

Look to your company’s managers to oversee workflows during the moving process. Make sure any deadlines that fall within your moving timeframe are addressed. You may also consider forming a voluntary moving committee of employees who want to be involved in the office move. Some team members may want to help pack or unpack, organize the move, or decorate the new office. When it comes to moving, take help wherever you can get it!

What You Should Do During Packing & Prepping Phase (3-6 Months)

The next phase of the moving process is the packing and preparing phase, which may be anywhere from 3-6 months before your office move. Details you’ll need to consider at this time include:

Determine the Moving Services & Number of Movers You Need

Once you’ve hired a moving company, don’t be afraid to ask for expert advice about what moving services you’ll likely need when relocating. Will you need professional packing services? Will you need a short-term storage solution before your moving day? How many commercial movers and moving trucks will you need? Are you interested in a cleanup crew or cleaning service to clean out your old office? Be sure to ask your moving company how flexible they are with moving times and dates. Is there a fee for coming early or staying late? Do they charge by the hour or per moving job? How are moving truck fees calculated? What happens if the movers get stuck in traffic? What moving services are included in your quote? Does your moving company supply or sell moving boxes and supplies? Have you considered renting bins or moving pods, or are you more comfortable with traditional cardboard moving boxes?

Make Arrangements With Building Managers & Cleanup Crews

Be sure to identify any potential obstacles before the moving day. You’ll need to work out the best moving schedule with your building managers, so you can coordinate truck arrivals and departures at the best times without disrupting building traffic. Several companies in the same building often share building exits and entrances, and you don’t want to make any of your neighbors mad by blocking them. If you’re hiring a cleanup crew to address everything inside your old building or get everything ready for you at the new location, you’ll need to work out the details in your service contracts.

Don’t Be Afraid to Downsize – Consider a Warehouse Sale

Many companies downsize when planning an office relocation. It makes sense if you’re planning to purchase new items for the new office. If you have a lot of old equipment sitting around like desks, chairs, or computers, consider hosting a warehouse liquidation sale to help recoup your new inventory costs. Be sure to inventory everything in your office, tagging items with stickers, so you know what’s being kept, what’s being tossed, and what’s potentially being sold.

Keep Your Employees in the Loop With Info and Meetings

We cannot stress enough the importance of keeping your employees in the loop as much as possible. If you elected to have a moving committee, host regular meetings. As the moving day approaches, this group may need to meet more often to discuss packing and organizing the move. You also shouldn’t neglect to continue conversations with the rest of your employees. Post status updates in company newsletters or on social media. Provide information about the new office location, including amenities, directions, and places to eat in the neighborhood. Talk about new seating plans, parking passes, and security IDs your employees will need and when to expect these items. Announce all vital information and be prepared to answer questions. You want everyone to feel comfortable about the office move!

What You Should Do During the Moving Phase (0-3 Months)

You’ve now come to the final phase of the moving process. You will spend the last three months packing, labeling moving boxes, and tying up any loose ends before moving day, including:

Discuss Packing and Labeling Your Moving Day Boxes

Depending on your headcount, assigning each department or team a color to label their boxes may be beneficial. Every employee likely has an employee number, which may also be used when labeling your moving boxes. Be sure to talk to your employees and ensure everyone knows what is expected of them during the move. Tap into your moving committee’s resources to identify any employees who wanted to help pack, unpack, or decorate the new office.

Connect and Disconnect the Utilities at Both Locations

Designate someone who will be responsible for contacting the utility companies to disconnect services at your old building and connect services at your new location. These services may include electricity, water, Internet, and phone systems. You may also want to conduct a final walk-through at both locations about two weeks out to ensure everything is ready for the moving teams. Some companies like to plan an opening day celebration or party once the dust clears and items have been unpacked in the new location. However you choose to mark this momentous occasion is up to you and your staff.

288,Office Relocation Checklist - Tips for Moving Office,https://www.arteil.com.au/blog/office-relocation-checklist/,,"Office Relocation Checklist: Moving Office with Minimal Stress

Moving office can be just the step in the right direction if you’re looking to refresh your business in a new and upgraded space to fit all your company’s growing needs. However, office relocation can be a stressful time, so a well-planned move is crucial.

It’s important to understand the challenges that come with relocating your current office to a new space, such as coordination, budgeting, or even productivity losses during the move. Before you start the move, try implementing a detailed office moving checklist, such as the one below, to ensure a stress-free move.

When thinking of what to include in your checklist, there are some key considerations to take into account. Everything from your selection of office chairs, to lighting and desk layout, the list can often feel overwhelming.

Location selection is an important aspect to consider. Look at the location you’re planning to move into and compare the most desirable locations with what factors you’re looking for in a new office space.

Do you want somewhere with a view, or maybe somewhere more quiet and secluded?

Consider space requirements, how big does the new office need to be?

Can the space comfortably fit all your staff, and does it have enough space for office equipment and storage?

What sort of layout are you looking for?

Another key consideration is the moving date and logistical requirements. What are your business’s IT and infrastructure requirements?

Before making the move, you need to ensure you have the perfect space to move into, in the right location that fits all your needs.

Australian office relocation checklist

In preparation for the big move, you need to make sure you’ve thought of all the factors that come into the preparation and planning of office relocations.

1. Preparation

Ensure you have the perfect space for your new office, with all the requirements to best suit your needs, and that all your equipment is ready to be moved.

2. Early Planning

Consider all possible challenges you may face during the move and come up with an office relocation plan for how to tackle these should they arise.

3. Scheduling

Pick a moving date for the relocation that best suits your business, perhaps during a period when you’re not busy or would be closed.

4. Inventory management

Make sure all your office furniture and equipment are recorded, packed away properly and ready to be moved. Remind employees to pack personal belongings and help with communal spaces. It’s important to take inventory before and after the move to ensure nothing is lost or damaged.

5. Communicating with employees

Keep in touch with your employees about the upcoming move. Notify the entire team as plans evolve to ensure there is no miscommunication or unnecessary stress.

6. Hiring professional movers

The right moving company can make office relocation far less stressful. Investing the time to find professional office relocation services you can trust is a more crucial step in the process than you may think.

7. Notifying clients and suppliers

Don’t forget about your clients! Let them know you’re moving to a new location and make sure they know the new office address once your business moves. The same goes for suppliers and cleaning services – they’re just as important.

It’s time to move offices

Once you have moved, there is still much to be done before the office relocation is officially complete. Now for the fun part, you get to decorate your new office!

Investing in new office furniture can be just what you need for a fresh start. You need to go through the decision-making process for investing in new furniture, such as evaluating current furniture needs, budgeting for new purchases, and creating a seating plan that fits the new office environment you’re going for.

When looking for new furniture to make your new space pop, ergonomic mesh office chairs could be just the thing to enhance employee comfort and productivity.

Ergonomic office chairs are perfect for posture support, reducing back and neck pain, relieving hip pressure, improving blood circulation, and therefore boosting productivity. These benefits are important factors to look for when considering new office chairs, as well as how well they will integrate into your new space and office layout.

To ensure an efficient and organised move, some tips and strategies could include categorising items, labelling boxes according to these categories, special care for sensitive equipment, and minimising downtime between moving projects to get everything done more efficiently and quickly.

Moving process on the day

Now let’s look at managing the office relocation on moving day. This includes coordinating with movers, ensuring IT infrastructure is safely relocated, phone systems and internet connection have minimal downtime. Keep employees informed to ensure adequate communication during the move.

Post office move considerations checklist

Just as it is important to be prepared before the big move, it’s a good idea to also put together a checklist of what needs to be done after the move.

1. Setting up workspaces

Put together desks, drawers and chairs to ensure each of your valuable employees has the perfect workspace to boost their productivity, as well as put together the new office space and layout.

2. Updating company information

Update your website, email sign-offs and location details to make sure clients can find you at your new location.

3. Getting employee feedback

It’s important to check in with your employees as they’re the ones that keep your business running efficiently. Make sure they’re all happy and comfortable in the new environment and ensure you act on any feedback or criticisms to keep a positive space for everyone.

4. Resuming normal operations

Now everyone’s all settled in the new office, make sure you keep business as usual. This will help the transition to be less jarring if there’s more familiarity in the usual work set-up.

To keep an overall stress-free relocation, some tips and tricks for stress reduction could include aspects like maintaining open communication, ensuring employee well-being, and having a contingency plan to ensure risk management should you need to resort to your Plan B.

Enjoy your new space

Now that you’ve had a successful and stress-free move, you get to embrace your new office space and enjoy the positive impact of the new, well-equipped office space. Congratulations on the relocation, now you can look forward to enhanced productivity and employee satisfaction.

298,Office Relocation and Facilities Management | A Guide by ...,https://anabas.co.uk/news/office-relocation-and-facilities-management/,,"Moving an entire office and all the considerations that come with having employees, takes a great deal of planning and coordination.

Whether as part of a merger and acquisition (M&A) or as a move to flexible working post-pandemic, office changes happen for a variety of reasons. It may be that your business has grown beyond its usual walls or that your requirements for space within your current office have changed.

At Anabas, we have lots of experience in relocating our clients to new buildings. As such, we know the things to watch out for and can guide and support you to help with a smooth transition. This blog covers all elements of an office relocation from the large aspects to the small finer details.

How do you manage an office relocation?

There are key areas for your FM team to consider and manage carefully:

Post-relocation office reinstatement

Planning schedules for ensuring a smooth transition between the two sites

A change in the scope of existing facilities management services required and changing resource levels of facilities staff as a result

Engaging with building occupants

Post-relocation office reinstatement

Once your previous office building has been vacated, there will inevitably be furniture or other items no longer required or temporary fixtures that need moving to return the building back to its previous state.

Reinstatement could include:

Removing temporary walls that were erected

Deconstructing office furniture

Managing the disposal of all the unwanted furniture and other office supplies

Removing any custom décor and painting the office to a neutral colour scheme

Removing internal and external branded office signage

All these elements, in addition to any specific to your company, should be included in your reinstatement.

Planning schedules for ensuring a smooth transition between the two sites

Your facilities management team will need early access to the new building to carry out some key activities ahead of your people attending their place of work for the first time. To ensure a smooth transition for your people, your FM team will;

Implement all Health & Safety and emergency planning procedures and processes

Carry out all Covid-19 risk assessments and train facilities staff accordingly to the Covid-19 safety measures in place

Conduct pre-move familiarisation/orientation tours to gain knowledge of the new facilities

Produce move plans for all staff equipment and consumables

Test new technology, systems, and processes in place for the effective FM service delivery Identify appropriate work schedules for all services in scope

Any maintenance works will also need to be managed and completed during this time, ahead of staff attending the workplace. There also may be remediation or facility upgrades needed, and this will require scheduling in good notice.

New facilities staff

If the new office space is larger than your previous facility, or over a set distance, asking the existing FM team to relocate with the office isn’t always feasible. Planning for staff changes, handovers and more with your existing team is just as important as the move itself.

Whether this means hiring an extended team, outsourcing your FM needs, or pulling existing contractors on fixed term relocations to assist with the move – these factors must be taken into consideration when planning for the new site.

Change in scope of existing FM service delivery

An office relocation is also an ideal time to review the existing FM service provision and discuss any changes you may need in the new space. This could be a service review, a change in strategy or simply a feedback session. Maintaining your relationship with your existing FM provider, is helpful in ensuring a smooth transition during office relocations, as they will already be familiar with your company and its needs.

Engaging with building occupants

On the day(s) of the office relocation, multiple teams will need to be on-hand to ensure a smooth transition. It is useful to have:

Concierge teams to direct people carefully

Switchboard teams to direct calls if the telephone system has changed

Reception teams to welcome guests and manage meeting systems

FM operatives on hand to carry out inductions and DSE assessments with all staff

Relocating to another office

There are many factors that will play a part in relocating to another office. With our approach to service delivery, Anabas is well equipped to assist you in all aspects of your office relocation.

1. Establish a Schedule

In order to remain efficient, it helps to set a schedule for your move. You might even want to start planning about five months before moving day.

Take a look at the size of your office, including how much furniture and equipment you have. Considering the size of your office will help you determine how many days the move will take.

Take time to make a thorough to-do list of what you'll need to accomplish before moving day. For example, you'll need to pack, call clients or suppliers, and maybe reschedule meetings.

Don't forget to review your lease, too. Are you planning on leaving before your lease lapses? In that case, you might lose your deposit.

Make sure to review the move-out details listed in your lease. For example, are you responsible for damages that occur during the move?

Once you've established a schedule, consider a budget for your move, too. Your budget will inform many of the remaining items on this office relocation checklist. By setting a budget, you can ensure you don't overspend long before moving day.

2. Assign Tasks

You don't have to plan the entire move alone! Instead, consider bringing in a team member from each department. Together, you can form a moving committee, which will make it easier to keep the entire company informed.

Review the schedule you created with your moving committee. Then, assign tasks to each person. Delegating will help you continue daily operations as you plan for the office move.

Each department should also create a plan for the new office. Where do they plan on positioning furniture, including cubicles? Creating a plan long before moving day will make the day-of a lot easier.

Otherwise, you'll spend the day of the move navigating small problems you could have taken care of earlier.

3. Start Donating

Take stock of your current office equipment. What do you plan on keeping? Anything you don't want, you don't have to take with you during the move.

Instead of wasting time packing and moving unwanted equipment, donate it. That way, you can save time and money before moving day.

If you're having someone pick up your donations, make sure to schedule the pick up before moving day. Planning an earlier pick-up will keep one less item off your plate during the move.

4. Pack Early

Once you know what you're keeping, start packing! You don't have to wait for the day or even the week of your office relocation. Instead, try packing the items you don't commonly use on a daily basis.

Packing a little each day will help you maintain daily operations and make progress on your relocation checklist. Otherwise, your office move will take up too much of your time the day-of.

Getting ahead with your packing will help minimize your stress. Instead of scrambling to accomplish everything at the last minute, you can get a lot done during the months before the move.

Make a list of everything you're taking with you on the move. Then, gather the boxes and office moving supplies you need.

5. Get Labeling

Once you start packing your office, take the time to label each box. Make a list of everything that's packed within each box, too. If you end up needing something before moving day, you can check the list for what's inside each box.

Make sure to number each box along with its list of items. Mark the top and side of each box with its number so the information is easy to find. Numbering your boxes will also help you avoid losing something during the move.

If something does get lost during the move, you'll know exactly what's missing. Then, you can make a claim to replace those missing items after your move.

Make sure to wrap and pack heavy office equipment like computer monitors individually. You might also want to park the computer's hard drive to preserve the data. If your data is on the cloud, make sure to back everything up before the move.

6. Hire Help

There are over 2,507 Canadian moving companies in the industry. That includes shippers, movers, and packers. Make sure to call for the office moving services you need long before the day of your move.

Finding the right help can take time, especially if you're moving out of state or internationally. Make sure to hire help within the months before your move. That way, you have time to vet different companies without feeling rushed.

Take the time to read online reviews, compare different quotes, and make a list of the services you need before choosing a moving company.

Don't forget to ask for proof of insurance as well. Asking for insurance coverage will ensure your belongings are protected. Otherwise, you might find yourself in trouble if something gets lost on the day of the move.

7. Keep Everyone Informed

Let everyone know that you're relocating offices. You'll need to inform creditors, the bank, the post offices, and your clients. You can also plan for new stationery and business cards, too.

Don't forget to update your website as well!

8. Get Ready to Move

On the day of the move, make sure you have all the access cards and keys you need. Hand them out and make sure your team is ready to go! With these tips, you can make sure everyone is ready and prepared to settle in.

86,Office Space - Community Economic Development,https://economicdevelopment.extension.wisc.edu/articles/evaluating-office-space/,,"April 2022 — Downtown office space is connected to the success of service businesses, housing, entertainment, and plays an important role in promoting a healthy community where people can live, work, and play. Office space is a significant component of a healthy downtown because it generates employment and daytime activity, which supports other downtown businesses such as restaurants, retail, entertainment, and personal and professional service businesses. Downtown office space also supports housing and lodging development, which in turn can help bring vibrancy to the downtown outside of normal working hours.

This section provides information and tools to assess the office market based on supply and demand. It is intended to only be a starting point, providing a preliminary market overview.

Office Space Trends

Demand for office space has changed over the years. With the growth of the suburbs, many employers moved from downtown locations to the periphery to take advantage of lower rents, less expensive parking, and proximity to worker’s homes. More recently, the Great Recession forced many companies to downsize leading to high vacancy rates. Despite these forces, office space continues to be an important component in many downtowns.

Law firms, accountants, and financial advisers locate in downtowns not only because it’s important to their image, but because they need to be close to the court system and other public institutions from which they draw a portion of their business. Other types of businesses, including corporate headquarters, are attracted to vibrant downtowns for reasons associated with talent attraction. These businesses believe that locating downtown will help them compete more effectively for young, skilled professionals that are looking for more walkable, amenity rich locations in which to work and possibly live.

While some communities do find demand for downtown office space, the supply of appropriate space is often limited. Of particular concern is the mismatch between the size (square footage) of existing office buildings and the space demands of small to midsize companies and independent entrepreneurs. Downtowns may have few, if any, code compliant, affordable, and appropriately sized office spaces for the types of users that are attracted to downtown locations.

Other trends shaping the market for office space include an increase in telecommuting—that is, working from home through the use of technology—and changes in work preferences among young professionals. Smartphones and communications software diminish the need for dedicated physical offices, with many offices remaining unused for full or partial days due to remote working from a variety of locations. These trends are reasons why square footage per worker is decreasing in the United States. The following chart depicts changes in office space density per worker over time.

How we work is also impacting office design. Traditional cubicle and doored offices have been replaced by open plan offices designed to promote communication and collaboration and are characterized by shared desk space and technology functions. Amenities such as fitness centers, shared kitchens, pet facilities and lounge areas are also being incorporated into new and repurposed office space reflecting changes in consumer demand.

Office Space Supply

Inventory

The current supply of office space provides a basis for assessing market conditions in a community. In order to assess the supply of office space, it is important to take an inventory of existing office stock. Depending on the community, it may be important to analyze not only the downtown area but also the surrounding trade area if there is competitive office space located there. In smaller communities, much of the quality building stock might be located at the edge of town and it is important to note how that affects the downtown office environment.

Important factors to include in an inventory are location, unit quantity, size, and class of office space in the community.

Location: Smaller communities’ office locations can be identified by address or identified on a map. For larger communities or regions, GIS can be used to plot office employment using data from sources such as the Census Bureau’s On the Map. This exercise is useful in terms of understanding the spatial distribution of office space but is not critical to the market analysis.

Unit Quantity: The number of office buildings in the downtown and market area should be estimated if possible. This may not be feasible for large communities, but it is for smaller communities.

Size: The total square footage of office space should be estimated and tenants recorded. For larger communities, this data is available through quarterly reports produced by organizations such as Newmark Knight Frank. For smaller metro and rural areas, the analyst must compile the data painstakingly. Methods to do so include talking with local realtors, business owners, and property owners. Google Earth can also locate office buildings within the community and estimate square footage using the polygon tool.

Class: Properties are assigned a class that categorizes the current conditions and overall quality of office space. Office buildings are divided into three classes: A, B, and C. Depending on the size of the community it may not be realistic to assign a class to each office property; however, the downtown analyst should have a general understanding of where different classes of office buildings are found throughout the trade area.

In summary, the analyst should compile information on existing office supply using the categories listed above, both within the downtown study area and within the trade area. This should be done using an Excel spreadsheet to facilitate future data updates and analysis.

Additions to Supply

The projection of office space supply requires analyzing information on new projects, as well as renovations, conversions, and demolitions. Data on construction can be obtained through local assessors, and county or regional planning commissions.

Lease Terms

Lease terms are an important consideration for understanding of the existing and potential market for office space. They are important for developing an understanding of how downtown office space competes with other locations within a community and across the region or trade area.

Lease information can be obtained through public sources such as loopnet.com and from assessors, building owners, and leasing brokers. In compiling lease data, one should keep in mind that the data is often reported in different formats and presented in terms of monthly or annual rents per square foot.

Under a Triple Net Lease (NNN), the tenant is responsible for paying the building property taxes, insurance, maintenance, and repairs during the term of the lease. The rent charged in the triple net lease is typically lower than the rent charged in a standard lease agreement because the tenant is paying for the additional costs associated with managing the property.

Office Space Demand

Office space demand is a function of economic conditions including the local and regional business climate, population growth, and employment trends. These factors are essential in understanding historical and projected changes in business activity, office-dependent businesses, and community job creation. As previously mentioned, macro trends in office space demand have been changing since the Great Recession. Many companies have downsized in office space and do not see a need for more space with telecommuting and remote work increasing in popularity. However, demand has increased for collaborative and shared work environments and there continues to be demand for office space in downtown locations for some larger corporate employers as well as those predisposed to downtown locations such as accountants, lawyers, bankers, and dentists.

Location of office space and surrounding amenities are primary drivers of office space demand. Companies prefer office space located in areas with:

close proximity to required business support services

adequate and inexpensive parking

convenient restaurants and retail outlets

access to transportation networks such as transit, highways, major thoroughfares, and airports

Commercial real estate companies or similar organizations publish reports on national or regional office markets and while they are less relevant to small and medium sized downtowns, they are a resource to stay up to date on trends. Below is a link to a website that publishes quarterly reports on the current state of the national office market.

The COVID-19 pandemic has exasperated the situation of underutilized office buildings. During a period of remote work, the understanding of how/where we go to work has changed significantly. Many employees that have worked at home, find it very productive, and rewarding. This will likely continue to have an impact on the real estate market for office and workspace.

Tenant Type

It is important to be aware of the type and quality of tenants in a community because certain building types are better suited for different office tenants. It is essential to know what types of businesses currently occupy office space in order to project future demand for space. It is also important to consider who their clients are and why they chose their current location. According to Coldwell Banker Richard Ellis Group (CBRE), the following tenants lease the most office properties in the United States:

high-tech

business services

financial services

health care

government

insurance

creative industries

legal

Office space can also be divided into three types of uses:

Activities that serve a non-local market such as regional offices of major corporations or financial services companies. This use is usually found in large cities but can also be found in smaller cities, one example might be the corporate headquarters of a locally based manufacturing firm.

Activities that serve the local market such as accountants, bankers, dentists, doctors, insurance agents, lawyers, government, and real estate brokers. These types of office uses are common in small to medium sized downtowns, especially county seats.

Light industrial businesses such as research and development companies or technology firms.

Analysis of Past Demand

Analysis of office space demand begins with an examination of historical office employment, occupied space, and lease rates. This information is used to make general inferences about office space demand. For example, if a community has experienced employment growth, low vacancy rates, and increasing rents over the last few years, it can be inferred that demand for office space is likely to continue increasing. Similarly, increasing vacancy rates and falling rents could be an indication of decreasing demand. This method of analysis infers future demand based on historical data and trends and cannot be completely relied upon. This method should be accompanied by professional interviews with local real estate brokers, developers, and business owners that have an intimate knowledge of the office market.

Sample Analysis of past office space demand for Officetown, USA

2009 2019 Analysis Available Sq. Ft. 6,000,000 6,5000,000 Moderate increase in space Vacant Sq. Ft. 600,000 975,000 Increase in vacant Sq. Ft.

Ft. $12.00 $15.25 Rates increased roughly 5% per year Total Employment 36,000 38,050 Slight increase in employment

Analysis of Future Office Space Demand

One of the primary influences of office space demand is the growth or decline of office-using jobs. Therefore, the ratio of occupied office space (in square feet) to total employment can be used to project future office space demand. This ratio multiplied by the projected employment growth for each year provides key insights into demand based on employment growth. If the data is available, this ratio should be calculated individually for each significant industry sector in a community. This will compensate for different office needs based on business type. Applying this ratio to industries driving office space demand will provide the best information to assess future office space needs. Demand driving industries will differ in communities, but they will commonly be finance, insurance, real estate, healthcare, and government. Also, this is a simplified analysis and may not be as applicable to small cities due data availability and limited employment in all industries.

One limitation with the ratio method is the assumption that the space needs of office employees and companies remain constant when in fact they may fluctuate. These methods also do not account for current office space trends. It has been widely published that square footage per employee is shrinking due to telecommuting, flexible work schedules, and shared work space. The shrinking square footage per worker trend will not have an immediate impact on smaller downtowns, but still should be kept in mind.

Changes in lease rates can also affect the demand for office space. For example, if vacancy rates are shrinking, this may cause an increase in market rent and potentially reduce office space demand.

Sample Projection of Future Office Space Demand

Step 2

Step 3

In this example, it is estimated that Officetown, USA will need to accommodate approximately 658,650 Sq. Ft. of office space for the 10% employment growth over the next five years. This can be accomplished through absorption of vacant and new office space.

Public Institutions

Local, state, federal, and tribal units of government also generate demand for both new and rehabilitated office space downtown. A 2005 University of Wisconsin-Extension Report titled “The Importance of Government Facilities in Downtowns: An Analysis of Business Establishments in Wisconsin’s County Seats” found that,

“Public facilities are essential components of a healthy, strong and vibrant downtown. Many communities have seen economic and social benefits when the post office, municipal building, public library or other important public buildings stay or are expanded downtown.”

The report’s analysis affirms the merit of retaining major governmental activities in downtown areas. In many cases, these governmental functions are office-based and directly incentivize additional private sector investment in retail, restaurants, health care, and professional service establishments. Downtown analysts should therefore meet with local elected officials and staff to identify future downtown space demands for this sector of the office economy.

Evaluating Office Space Opportunities

Depending upon the results of the supply and demand analysis, the following methods for filling office space may be applicable to your community. It is worth repeating that downtowns in small to mid-size communities are unlikely to attract large corporations, unless these corporations are locally based. Typical drivers of office space are industries with local clients such as finance, insurance, real estate, healthcare, and government organizations. In addition, artists, entrepreneurs and startups may find downtown office space attractive under the right set of circumstances.

New Office Space

Given the current market, it would be risky for developers in most downtowns to build speculative office space. New private office space is now typically developed once a tenant for the space has been identified. In this case, downtown advocates should work with the community and developer to ensure that new office is developed in a manner that supports the overall objectives of the downtown district. For example, how can the new building be situated to maximize economic impact on surrounding downtown retailers and restaurants?

Rehabilitation and Retention of Existing Office Space

Converting underutilized space to office use through building rehabilitation is often more plausible for small communities than new office space construction. Small office space development could be an opportunity for some communities and usually involves the reuse of upper floors in existing downtown buildings. Although they would likely be Class B or C office spaces, office space in central business districts or other commercial areas could be a desirable and unique location for many firms. Many creative and professional firms seek these unique locations because of their central location and historical characteristics.

With building rehabilitation or repurposing, short and long-term attractiveness must be a consideration to assure tenant demand for the space. It is also important that office space be designed to match the typical office needs of prospective organizations. Trends affect average office space size and it is important to offer areas that are properly sized and have sufficient amenities to attract tenants. This also may affect the feasibility of which buildings can be repurposed to office spaces.

Shared Office Space

In addition to the traditional style workplace of multiple year leases, there are three other popular office styles that help support startup companies and entrepreneurs. They are business incubators, business accelerators, and co-working offices and all three can be successful methods to spur economic growth in downtown areas.

Business incubators are a way to provide office space or business expertise to startup companies through government, economic development, or academic sponsors. Typically, a sponsor partially or fully subsidizes the cost of office space and helps guide the company with business knowledge in market research, accounting, or other business services. Businesses would need to apply and be accepted into a business incubator program and would usually stay for a few years. In small town economies, small businesses that grow quickly have an immediate impact on the local economy through job creation and increased spending. Increasing business success rates through incubators may be an important tool for small communities.

Business accelerators, also called seed accelerators, are very similar to business incubators, but they differ in a few important ways. Business accelerators also provide office space and expertise to startups, but accelerator programs are very intensive and most business stay for a handful of months rather than years. Also, unlike business incubators, accelerators are hosted predominantly by private investors or businesses that are given company equity in return for their assistance.

Co-working space is a shared office normally used by small companies, independent workers, freelancers, and others who would usually work from home or be self-employed. Co-working facilities allow these workers to have an office away from home at the cost of monthly dues and it also creates a social and collaborative workspace for like-minded workers. It is also common for co-working facilities to have a value system and community building environments.

There are many successful incubators, accelerators, and co-working spaces throughout the country. A local example of a successful co-working space is called Rise & Grind and has a location in both Oshkosh and Green Bay, WI. They host approximately sixty members and pride themselves on offering weekly and monthly public events in addition to standard co-working uses of their facilities.

Developing Conclusions

Finally, it is important to develop goals and strategies based on office space supply, demand, and opportunities that make sense in your community. This is done at the broad downtown area level, and should not attempt to reflect individual projects which deserve their own feasibility study. While more detailed feasibility work may be needed, this assessment should provide business leaders with a preliminary market overview of office space development opportunities downtown.

Accordingly, general conclusions still become apparent through this level of analysis. Example conclusions could include:

growth in demand for office space is likely to increase by X square feet in the next 10 years

the growth and office space will accommodate X new employees to the downtown area in the next 10 years

X new office buildings of approximately Y square feet each could be supported by the growth in demand

older buildings and underutilized buildings representing approximately X square feet have the opportunity to be upgraded to class C or class B space, allowing it to attract additional new tenants and industries downtown

the additional new and rehabilitated office buildings have the potential to draw significantly more employees downtown, representing a spectrum from entrepreneurs to seasoned and well-connected institutions.",planning new office location
103,Office Space Planning - Here's what you need to know,https://btoffice.co.uk/what-we-do/space-planning/faq/,,"What are the Factors to consider when planning the office layout?

Space

The first thing to consider: Is the space large enough to accommodate the staff numbers required, with each staff member allocated enough desk/work space and adequate breakout and collaboration facilities?

It is important to workout just how much desk space a full time or hot desking staff member requires. This is usually governed by the amount of IT equipment required, coupled with any paperwork as reference material for the user at the workstation. As a guide, the minimum desk size that can accommodate two monitors, or a monitor and a laptop combination is 1.4m wide x 700mm deep. For a single monitor workstation, the usual size would be 1.2m wide x 600mm deep. Whereas someone that only requires an occasional workspace for a laptop or tablet can work on a surface approx. 700mm wide x 600mm deep.

Once the numbers of staff and desk sizes have been agreed, it is then up to a space planner to see if the required amount of staff can be accommodated. However, there are still key factors yet to be considered before the design work can take place. Most desks will need to be close to a power source in able to power the IT. It needs to be ascertained if the power sockets are located around the perimeter walls or in a false floor, as this will have a major impact on where the desks can be located.

Routes to escape

Routes of escape, sensible corridor/walkways and spaces behind the desks need to be considered carefully during the planning of the office space. A chair will take up approximately 800mm behind a desk but it is always better to allow a minimum of 1m. When you have two chairs back to back, a minimum of 1.8m should be allowed as an absolute minimum between the desktops.

Storage Requirements

Storage requirements should also be considered. Does each user require personal storage at their desk? Or would a centrally controlled locker system be a better use of space and also a more cost-effective solution. Shared storage can be housed in one location or medium height storage units can be useful in dividing up departments and space.

Natural Light

Natural light and good air circulation are important for staff moral and a healthy working environment. If possible, workstations should be close to natural light but glare on computer screens should be considered when orientating the desks.

Any enclosed spaces required i.e. meeting rooms, private offices, prayer rooms, tea making facilities etc. also need to be considered.",planning new office location
633,Office Space Planning Considerations & Challenges Post- ...,https://btoffice.co.uk/office-space-planning-after-covid-19/,,"Office Space Planning Considerations & Challenges Post-COVID

It goes without saying that COVID-19 has had a huge impact on all areas of our lives. From the way we work to the way we socialise and even communicate. We have all made changes in order to prevent the spread in the last few years.

With a returning sense of normality, businesses face a number of challenges when navigating the new work environment. One of these challenges has been learning how to return to work safely.

In order to do this, it’s important that businesses consider the importance and relevance of their office space design. This includes looking at the health and safety of staff, meeting room demands, and hybrid working.

Key Considerations for Your Office Space Design

Employee Health and Safety

Employee health and safety has always been a top priority in any working environment, but it’s now more important than ever. It’s vital that your employees and customers feel safe when spending time in your office.

With this in mind, you should look closely at office space planning considerations to ensure that your workspace is as safe as possible.

From reconfiguring your floor plan to ensuring there is enough space between workstations. There are several effective office layout design strategies that you can put in place to meet the health and safety needs of your employees.

Other health and safety precautions that you can take include:

Investing in corporate office furniture and building materials that can be easily cleaned and sanitised

Ensuring humidity levels are between 40% and 60%

Investing in hygiene products employees need day-to-day, such as hand sanitizer, paper towels, and cleaning products

Increasing ventilation and filtration

Making sure employees understand their individual responsibilities for a clean, safe and healthy workplace

Please keep in mind, all employees must receive adequate health and safety training.

Remote Working and Reducing Office Space

The pandemic has prompted many businesses to question if they really need a large amount of office space. And for many, the resounding answer has been no.

With more employees working remotely, businesses are realising that they simply don’t need as much office space. Cutting back will allow them to make significant savings, with little impact on productivity and service levels. After all, advances in technology have made it incredibly easy for businesses to communicate, collaborate and even teach employees new skills at home.

Should this be a long-term decision? Many experts argue that employees working remotely is not in the best interests of businesses. They believe that, when employees are working away from the office, it becomes difficult to determine who is working hard and who isn’t. The impact that a lack of interaction has on employees’ mental health should also be a major consideration.

Of course, the decision ultimately with the individual business – but must be taken into account when planning your office space design.

Boardrooms and Meeting Room Furniture Demands

One of the major changes in how we’ve worked in the last two years has been a significant reduction in the amount face-to-face meetings. Employees have been encouraged to use video conferencing instead where possible.

However, it seems now that boardrooms and meeting rooms are being used again, albeit less frequently than before.

If you find that demand for your meeting and boardrooms has dropped significantly, it might be time to consider whether you need to dedicate as much space to face-to-face gatherings. Some of the space could be better used in other ways, such as spreading out your commercial office furniture or creating breakout spaces where employees can carry out video calls.

When your meeting rooms are in use, it’s important they are used safely. One of the most sensible ways to use meeting rooms post-COVID is to limit the number of people who gather in closed meeting rooms by using a scheduling system and displaying a maximum occupancy.

All meeting room furniture surfaces should also be cleaned frequently, so make sure time for cleaning is factored into your booking system. Investing in an air conditioning or air filtration system can also help keep everyone safe.

Video Conferencing and AV Improvements

Throughout the pandemic, there has been a stark rise in the need for high-performance video conferencing and AV solutions. Allowing employees to collaborate at home, in the office and off-site, these tools are now one of the best ways to connect and engage, without relying on face-to-face meetings.

One way to combine remote and in-office team members is by using conference room media cabinets. By using a media cabinet, staff in the office can collaborate easily with remote workers using large screens and video conferencing.

Open Vs. Closed Corporate Office Layouts

To create a safe and spacious working environment, you might need to consider changing the layout of your office. For example, what percentage of office space will be dedicated to private offices? What about meeting spaces or workstations? You should also think about whether an open or closed corporate office layout will be best.

To do this, you should weigh up the pros and cons of both…

Pros of an Open Office Space

Promotes transparency

Encourages collaboration

Increases engagement

Creates a sense of teamwork

Encourages creativity

More cost-effective

Improves accessibility

Cons of an Open Office Space

It’s easier for illnesses to spread

Employees can clash

Problems with noise

Pros of a Closed Office Space

Optimum privacy

A defined hierarchy

Fewer distractions

Improved focus

Cons of a Closed Office Space

Less communication

Expensive to build

Employees can engage in negative behaviour

Problems with supervision

Outdoor Working

Having enjoyed the freedom that comes hand-in-hand with working remotely, many people might struggle to make the transition back into working behind a desk for their full working day. After all, during lockdowns, many employees worked in their gardens during the warmer months. Others worked in different spaces to break up their working day, and many worked from natural beauty spots.

To make the transition as easy as possible, you should continue to encourage employees to work outdoors where possible, whether that’s to attend meetings, brainstorm with colleagues, or even for one-to-one meetings. There’s lots of comfortable outdoor furniture that provides the perfect environment to work from, as well as heat lamps and canopies to facilitate the changing weather conditions.

Not only will this provide flexibility and boost employee satisfaction, but it will also help create a more COVID-secure workplace.

Why Do You Need Office Space Planning Software?

If you’re struggling with office space planning, you will be pleased to hear that there is office space planning software available that will allow you to access the valuable workplace data you need to plan ahead.

Using space planning software will allow you to:

Access available capacity

241,Office Space Planning: The Complete Guide For Business ...,https://www.bondcollective.com/blog/office-space-planning,,"1) Budget

The cost of office space planning is always a consideration. Sure, you could go all out, spare no expense, and refurb your business’s workspace from top to bottom.

In some cases, that may be necessary. In most cases, though, your business will be better served by setting a budget and sticking to it.

2) Available Space

Available space is one of the major concerns when office space planning.

Take into account the total square footage and then examine how your business allocates it. Is there a better way to arrange things?

3) Capacity

Capacity — the number of people your space accommodates comfortably — is another important variable to consider when planning to rearrange your office.

Combined with your business’s available space, capacity sets the tone for all the decisions that follow.

If you don’t know exactly how many people you want your work environment to include, you can’t properly plan an effective arrangement.

4) Desired Concept

There are many concepts available for your office space planning needs.

Your team may be best served by one of these options:

Do a bit of research and decide on the concept that’s the most effective for your business.

5) Demand

Before getting too far into your office space planning, talk to your team to find out if they need a specific type of area that they don’t currently have (or can’t create from existing infrastructure).

Doing so will ensure that any changes you make will support the way your employees want to work.

6) Fixed Features

The fixed features in the building around you will dramatically affect your office layout and functionality.

Map out and provide space around such elements as:

Fire exits

Doors

Structural components

Bathrooms

Windows

Steps

Entryways

Taking these fixed features into account at the beginning of the process will help you avoid last-minute “improvisations” that may detract from the effectiveness of your layout.

7) Compliance

Workplace governance standards and safety regulations can dramatically influence the options you have for rearranging your workspace.

Compliance is akin to the fixed features of your building — you have very little control of them, but you have to incorporate them into all designs.

Compliance issues involve such considerations as blocking fire exits, installing ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) power outlets in the break room, and providing enough ventilation.

Getting to know the OSHA standards and building code ordinances that apply to your business will help you provide the best work environment for your team and avoid hazards, fines, and lawsuits.

107,Office design ideas: focus spaces and quiet working,https://www.mmoser.com/ideas/office-design-ideas-focus-spaces/,,"Why do we need focus spaces in the office?

In today’s fast-paced work environment, having spaces where you can work without distraction is more important than ever. On average, information workers are distracted every 10.5 minutes. Afterwards, it can take up to 25 minutes to get back on track. Designers who create spaces for high performers should take this potential loss of attention seriously.

We need focus spaces to counterbalance collaborative workspace. Although the office has become a place primarily for being with others, people work together more effectively between bouts of focused work. For instance, most people prefer to go away and process information before coming back together to share their thoughts.

What is a focus space?

A focus space is a room or area in an office designed to allow people to work on tasks that need concentration. They are typically quiet and free from distractions, making them the perfect spot to work on complex tasks – increasing productivity, creativity, and job satisfaction.

Creating the right mix of focus spaces

It’s vital to have a variety of focus spaces within the office environment to meet the needs of different people. Some prefer a quiet, isolated area, while others prefer a more collaborative environment with drop-in pods for private calls.

When we design for neurodiversity, quality focus options are essential. A good space plan will locate focus options away from the main circulation routes – chance encounters are a huge source of distraction. The office interior design will also consider how colour, material, lighting, and noise shape people’s experience. For example, a calm and quiet environment might include dropped ceilings, soft furnishings, and muted colours.

Sophie Foster, Senior Workplace Strategist, says focus goes well beyond aesthetics. “Focus, or what psychologists describe as flow, happens most effectively when people are relaxed, slightly challenged, and have the cognitive capacity to work on their task. Sensory design can positively impact flow by reducing sensory overload and promoting helpful emotions through the inputs we receive through sight, smell, taste, touch and sound”. Clearly, we can enhance focus quality by designing workplaces with the full range of senses in mind.",planning new office location

Beijing China Virtue Architectural Design

This new workspace between the East 4th-5th Ring Road of Beijing City aims to provide for its users with both a space to work in and also relax and feel close to nature. Sitting in the city's outskirts, near the green belt, the project is a low volume with generous flowing interior spaces wrapped in sweathes of glass that lead the eye to outdoor courtyards and greenery beyond. ‘By placing more attention to designer's work condition, physical and mental health, the project hopes to build up to be the most popular office for designers,' say the architects, the local practice Beijing China Virtue Architectural Design.

Urban Valey, Massy, France

ateliers o-s architectes

This office building in Massy, just south of Paris, sits within a business park, forming an intergral part of the area's built environment. The architects created a form that feels minimalist but also intricate enough to hint at the surrounding landscape, featuring a series of pitched roofs and a striated skin that adds depth and nuance to the, otherwise fairly simple, utilitarian facade. The design makes it eye catching but also functional, as its flexible interior and different sections can be divided up for the use of different clients if needed. ‘The general image of the project is that of a toolbox, a technological and functional tool that marks the dynamism of the city of Massy, with a concern for architectural, urban and landscape quality while offering an evolving technical device,' say the architects.

Tenjin Business Center, Fukuoka, Japan

OMA

This mixed-use office complex by OMA in Japan's fifth largest urban hub has just reached completion. Led by OMA partner Shohei Shigematsu, the scheme is the studio's first in town - which is also the architect's home town. ‘The building program is predominantly workspace, within a given massing that is neither low-rise nor tower, so the design was conceived through hyper-focused interventions that subtly merge and connect human and urban scale, two streets of different character, inside and outside, city and nature. The result is an efficient office block with the most memorable corner—an excavation of the building toward more openness. A Big Bang signifies a starting point, and I hope this gesture will be an invitation for future developments to participate in creating a network of activated intersections and public zones that knit the new district together,' he says.

Xiaoshan Innovation Polis · Pioneer Valley, China

UAD

Part of the Hangzhou Xiaoshan Innovation Polis, a business hub on the south bank of Qiantang River, this impressive piece of architecture is a key piece for the wider development as well as a future landmark for the Chinese city. ‘To cater to the needs of young innovators, researchers and entrepreneurs in Xiaoshan Innovation Polis, the design adopts the concept of the ‘Cube', which signifies the infinite possibilities of entrepreneurship and scientific research and the vitality of the young,' say the architects. ‘With staggered elegant cubic volumes and artificial lighting at night, the building presents a futuristic, instagrammable image throughout the day at the side of the Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway, hence becoming an iconic landmark that represents Xiaoshan Innovation Polis.'

Roche Pharmaceuticals, Germany

Christ & Gantenbein

An ‘industrial palazzo’ has been added to the growing campus of Roche pharmaceuticals in Grenzach-Wyhlen, Germany, near the Swiss border. The building, carefully tuned to balance the generous, no-nonsense attitude and durability of an industrial building and the cutting-edge, sleek feel of contemporary office architecture, is the creation of Christ & Gantenbein. This is the third structure that the Swiss architecture studio, located in nearby Basel, has designed for the healthcare multinational – but it’s one that stands out for its minimalist expression and cool, almost painterly nature. Roche’s multifunctional workspace building follows the architects’ signature approach and aesthetic that blends the use of seamless, scuptural concrete with pared down forms and supreme functionality. The studio has carved a reputation as a deft hand at balancing drama and subtlety, the hardness of concrete with soft, plastic forms.

Zhen Fund, China

Asap

This ethereal interior belongs to the new offices of the Zhen Fund, a financial company in Beijing. Its authors, New York and Los Angeles-based Adam Sokol Architecture Practice (Asap) were tasked with redesinging the interior of a high rise in the China World Trade Center. The result is a workspace explored through curves and colours. ‘Much of our recent work has explored various types of curves, and so we began to explore how that would impact this design as a solution,' says Sokol. ‘While seemingly inefficient at first glance, the curving glass conference rooms that became the signature of this project actually accomplished several things: they avoided the monotony of long double-loaded corridors that we all dreaded; they gave the design an immediately bold and visionary quality; lastly there was the happy benefit of the pockets of space created where the rooms meet.'

Stanford University School of Medicine, USA

HOK

The new building for the Stanford University School of Medicine, designed by HOK, has a special twist. Located in Palo Alto and making the most of the mild Northern California climate, the architects moved 20 percent of the program outside the building’s walls. Porches, balconies, and covered walkways become an essential part of the workspace, offering deskspaces and social hubs al fresco for the employees, arranged around the U-shaped, clean and modernist inspired building.

Álvaro H. Félix Studio

Drawing on a mid-sixties modern Mexican style, the architects at Álvaro H. Félix Studio have transformed a penthouse space on Masaryk Avenue, in the swanky Polanco neighbourhood of Mexico City. The result? A workspace that feels contemporary but also homely, balancing a retro feel (filled with metallic walls, golden tones and travertine marble details) with all the mod cons and spatial generosity a modern office needs. ‘The project reenacts the aesthetics of the revival of the financial markets in Mexico. A proposal that reimagines objects, materials and formal details which we grew up with like marble, wood and metal; it blends in contemporary design in a timeless eclecticism,' explains the design team.

Michael Hsu Office of Architecture

Four Hands, Austin’s leading global designer and wholesaler of trendsetting lifestyle home furnishings, now can boast a brand new, state-of-the-art office space. The designer behind it is Texas based Michael Hsu and his team, who aimed to balance the client's brand expression of classical style and nostalgia, with a forward-thinking approach and space. ‘We started with the question, ‘what if we built a house inside a warehouse?' With 24' high ceilings, and little access to daylight, how can we imbue this space with beauty, a human scale and sensibility?' says Hsu. ‘Ultimately we landed on a house-like central axis, which defines the expansive workplace. It will house meetings, private offices and get-away rooms. The ‘house' gets sliced by two light flooding paseos, bringing essential daylight and views to even the most far removed desks.'

Smithson Tower office, UK

ConForm Architects

Central London is chock-full of iconic architecture, but few buildings represent the brutalist style better than the iconic Smithson Tower – previously known as the Economist Building – which was designed in the early 1960s by Alison and Peter Smithson. Now, this piece of Grade II* listed modernist architecture includes a brand new warm and minimalist office interior, courtesy of ConForm Architects. Sat on the high rise’s 11th floor and occupied by a financial client, the workspace is sleek and contemporary but at the same time, the minimalist architecture feels homely and inviting, creating a comfortable, almost domestic working environment. The open floorplan adds to the steamlined look and directs the gaze towards the long views of the London skyline afforded by the windows. ‘The design responds to the contemporary move towards designing offices that are collaborative rather than cellular,’ explain the architects.

NORRØN Architects

A former textile warehouse in Copenhagen has been transformed into a ’territory for dreaming’. The office space has been designed by locally based NORRØN Architects. The use of raw materials, colourful architecture and reflected light enhance the space and add character. Detailing was also very important. For example, ‘a dark shiny green color was chosen in different sections of the office to add a certain depth to the architecture of the space, as seen both at the entrance and the furniture of the office,' says the team.

Following its creator's signature style, the office features concrete and glass surfaces and a facade arranged in a neat grid. ‘The building is effective in its simplicity. Concrete plays a key role as our main building material. Reducing it to the essentials is simultaneously reflected in top efficiency. For us, straight lines and pragmatism are key,' says the client's managing director Nicolai Weisenburger.

THE_SYSTEM LAB

JTBC, the largest media company in South Korea, now has a new contemporary headquarters to suite their reputation, courtesy of local architecture studio THE_SYSTEM LAB. Internal flexibility was the name of the game here. ‘We felt that the rapidly changing media environment doesn’t allow us to build a confirmed space with fixed programmes. We also had to consider 3 year time gap between the time we started the design and the time the construction would be completed. Therefore, we decided to build a physical infrastructure that could contain an agile process,' say the architects.

A refined workspace created by architecture studio Block722 for their own use, this Athenian interior makes the most of an existing office unit and long views of nature and ancient ruins in the heart of the Greek capital. By gutting the space to rebuild a flowing, open interior that fosters collaboration, the architects created generous, light filled spaces. Calming colour tones, natural materials and a sense of balance prevail. Artworks and craft-led bespoke items, such as pieces by Greek contemporary artist Pantelis Chandris, local artisan Serpetinis, a fabric woven by Athens based textile artist Chrysa Georgiou and sculptural pieces by French artist Benoît Averly, enrich the daily experience of working there for the some-30 staff.

Runxuan Textile Office, China

Lucien International, Masanori Designs

Sometimes building designs take their visual cues from what's going on inside them. This was the case with a new textile company's headquarters in Zhangcha, the well known fabrics producing urban hub in Foshan, China. Designed by Lucien International - Masanori Designs, the new building combines pure white tones with an undulating facade that mimics the movement of textile. With the curved tile facade dominating the first floor, where offices are, the ground level is left clean and simple, visible from the street through large glazed expanses. Minimalist white office furniture within blends effortlessly with the similarly pared down architectural features.

A new, sustainably minded office space has just opened up in London, in a relatively unlikely place - the northern neighbourhood of Cricklewood. Created by Simeon Anderson with the help of ex-Ilse Crawford studio designers Caireen O’Hagan and Corinne Quin, Wotton Works is a live/work complex set in a former aircraft parts factory. Its vast size - a lovely feature inherited from the building's past industrial use - meant the designers could fit flexible office space alongside residential units. This brand new hub is just a 15 mins train ride from central London.

Neri&Hu

Neri&Hu and Design Republic's new home is an imaginative, adaptive reuse of an existing commercial building in Shanghai. The famed Chinese architecture and design office is an expert at bringing existing architecture back to life, having done so with its previous locations. Its latest base sits within a small complex of ex-industrial buildings in the bustling Jing'an Temple area. Avoiding major structural alterations, the team reworked proportions and treatments, adding key elements inside and out, such as glass-brick surfaces and a black metal window frame. As a result, the exterior feels sophisticated and updated. Inside, the existing concrete post and beam frame was left intact and exposed, creating a rough, industrial feel. Sleek, modern ‘pods' were added within where necessary to create different types of space, such as meeting areas.

The latest addition at London's King’s Cross area is an angular office building by Coffey Architects. The structure sits at 22 Handyside Street and is a luminous and generous 36,000 sq ft building; yet its cleverly composed form and broken-down volumes and façade articulation make it feel boutique. These elements were designed to follow the movement of the sun throughout the day. The eco-conscious office design now aims for BREEAM Outstanding certification. The three-storey building is a lightweight concrete and steel composition featuring large windows. The façade also includes surfaces of embossed and perforated anodised aluminium panels that create a translucent effect, adding colour and texture.

A glazed front leads to an unexpected colourful reception area in this renovation of a tired 1980s office interior in London's Clerkenwell. Designed by architects Buckley Gray Yeoman, The Panagram is a workspace interior that was conceived to offer a twist to conventional office design. Here, graphic tile grids and brightly painted architectural elements (such as the primary yellow column in the entrance foyer) meet colourful lifts and curtains, terrazzo, bespoke quirky wooden details and lots of planting. Different zones within the building (for instance, private versus communal, co-working versus quiet areas) are clearly marked by differences in colour or material. There is even a highly customised wooden staircase with a tree growing out of it.

Le Monde Group HQ, Paris, France

Snøhetta

Bringing the 1,600 or so employees of Le Monde Group under a single roof, this new headquarters in Paris was designed by celebrated international architects Snøhetta. The bold, architecturally dynamic building is defined by its sleek façade (made of 20,000 pixelated glass elements) and undulating form that brings to mind an abstract bridge, creating a new plaza underneath it. While improving urban connections around it and adding to the public space, the structure is also sustainably minded, ensuring maximum natural ventilation and lighting is possible. Inside, it includes all-mod-cons needed for a 21st-century office, such as flexible workspace and break areas for staff, two auditoriums, and a planted roof terrace.

Thonik HQ, Amsterdam, The Netherlands

Thonik, MMX Architects

Graphic design studio Thonik has unveiled a new, custom-made office building in Amsterdam, created in collaboration with MMX Architects. The result is a highly graphic six-storey building on the city centre’s only post-war urban boulevard – the Wibautstraat. Three floors are dedicated to the practice, two to a high-end omakase restaurant and sake bar that draws you in at ground level, and the top floor (and rooftop) is soon to become an events and discussion space. The most striking thing about the building is the combination of floor-to-ceiling windows that bring the city in and open up the interiors, and the façade’s stripes – the effect is dazzling, but it’s also radical in its simplicity and highly detailed and elegant in its execution.

The sustainability-focused design and research practice responsible for fascinating collaborations with Ikea, Barkas, Effekt architects and many more, has opened a research and design lab in south Delhi. Designed as a public-facing platform for cross-disciplinary creatives to experiment with prototypes, the studio is located inside Chhatarpur's Dhan Mill Compound, a growing hub for emerging design studios, artists and young professionals. Kevin Curran, programme lead at SPACE10, wanted to combine ideas from Scandinavian and Indian design traditions together in the space. He involved local materials and craftsmen in sourcing materials and furnishing – for example, plant pots were handmade 200m from the space and ceramic figurines were made by Aman Khanna from Claymen, whose workshop and gallery is 50m away. Curran also brought a slice of the Copenhagen HQ with them, by painting the staircase in the same bright blue. SPACE10 has previously popped up in New York, London, Shanghai and Nairobi.

David Kohn Architects (DKA), working in collaboration with Nord Studio, has converted a listed Belle Époque interior into a new office for developer Euroboden. Located at Tempelhofer Ufer, the office inhabits the principal floor of the landmark Palais Eger built in 1881, a grand villa designed for a wealthy timber merchant featuring high ceilings, timber panelled walls and marquetry floors. Within these decorative spaces, the architects added colour, new materials such as Marmoreal (a nougat like engineered marble designed by Max Lamb for Dzek) as well as contemporary furniture. Inspired by Sir John Soane’s house museum in London, DKA wanted to capture an air of ‘productive domesticity’, where both work and cultural events could play out.

Takram, London, UK

Sam Jacob

For design innovation studio Takram’s London outpost, Sam Jacob Studio has created a ‘raw yet refined’ space defined by a composition of frameworks and armatures acting as workspace, storage and partitions. White horizontal planks are supported by a series of objects and material fragments assembled through a method of stacking and piling. The result forms a material library of textures and shapes – cement board sits alongside marble panels, concrete next to timber, orange tinted acrylic tubes and reflective chromed pipe. Meanwhile powder coated steel frames create a skeleton of a kitchen and workshop space, and are also used for custom furniture such as the long main office table. As an international design studio, we value ‘collective openness’ and celebrate different viewpoints and skillsets – we wanted to reflect this into space through material usage,’ says Yosuke Ushigome of Takram.

244,Office fit-out considerations: 6 key influencers,https://www.firstresponsems.com.au/blog/office-fit-out-considerations,,"An office fit-out is often a big project, as you must ensure the fit-out meets your business needs and helps your bottom line. This requires ample planning that lays out the entire process. With planning comes many steps you will need to take to achieve the best results.

When planning a fit-out for your commercial office space, there are several key considerations that will influence your strategy. The following are some of those considerations to keep in mind.

What to consider before undertaking an office fit-out

Purpose

Before you begin planning a new office fit-out, you need to establish its specific purpose. You shouldn't simply make decisions on a whim with a fit-out, whether you're moving into a new office space or upgrading an existing space. Think about what you want to achieve with the new fit-out and how it can help your business.

The ideal office space should provide a consistently satisfactory environment for employees or clientele. The design should also reflect your brand. Make sure your office fit-out aligns with your company's unique visual elements along with its vision, values, and message.

Budget

In addition to purpose, you need to consider your budget. You'll want to avoid spending too much on an office fit-out to the point where it hinders rather than helps your business. Keep in mind that office fit-outs are more costly today, making it necessary to take the right approach to get the most from your budget.

When deciding on the right approach, one foundation for your budget could be your long-term plans. Are you relocating to a new office where you plan to stay for several years? A bigger budget may be worth it. Alternatively, you may be planning an office refurbishment as your business prepares for a shift in the future. In this case, you shouldn't set your budget so high that it keeps you stuck in the same location.

Timing

An office fit-out is a potentially huge undertaking with many steps and elements involved. This is why the timing for it needs to be impeccable. Even if the perfect timing isn't possible, you must take into account every aspect to successfully plan the fit-out.

Some of the main steps involved in a fit-out may include:

Working with a commercial agent to find a new location

Developing a floor plan for the designated office space

Choosing a contractor to move forward with the fit-out

The design process

Furniture selection and ordering

Installation of furniture

Construction

Relocation to the new space

Each step can take several weeks to complete, which is why you should determine how to accommodate the fit-out based on your schedule. Engaging in a fit-out at the right time will minimise disruption and keep your operations smooth as you make the transition.

System design

A fit-out will entail far more than configuring the interior and aesthetics of the office. You'll also need to take into account the various systems that will make the space truly functional. Everything from your electrical systems to the windows should feature efficient and reliable designs.

There are many elements of system design to consider. One might be your office temperature control systems, which should have well-designed and well-placed venting, air conditioning units, and other equipment. Other considerations here might include:

What kind of lighting you use to illuminate the office space

The locations and operation of windows

How many electrical sockets you need for office operations

Restructuring space and staff needs during refurbishment

If your project is a workplace refurb, you will need to make sure your operations can continue in the meantime by restructuring the space. Your staff should be able to continue working efficiently during the refurbishment.

There are a couple of ways you can approach this. One is to try to fit out the office after hours when it will cause the least disruptions. The other is to gradually complete the fit-out around different areas of the office space to avoid interrupting critical operations. You may also want to facilitate more remote work if possible. Additionally, you'll need to maintain reliable communication channels for employees and clients during this time, which brings us to our next point.

Tech considerations

All office spaces require technology that they can count on at all times, including IT and telecom systems that enable operations to run smoothly. During your fit-out, you may change your existing system. But this could negatively impact your tech systems if you're not careful. Your new office should also have a system that's just as reliable as your current system (if not more so).

You can keep your office's technology working optimally by strategically integrating IT and telecom solutions into your fit-out. Moving to the cloud can assist your business hugely during this process. This step is crucial for any fit-out, whether you're accommodating existing equipment or transitioning to new technology.

Take the right steps for a successful office fit-out

Regardless of your plans, accounting for each of these considerations will help keep the fit-out process efficient and minimally disruptive. The key is to formulate a strong plan and work with the right partners to help you successfully realise this plan.",considering new office space
211,Office fit-out cost growth downshifts to 2.7%: JLL,https://www.cfodive.com/news/office-fit-out-cost-growth-downshifts-jll/718659/,3 дня назад,"Dive Brief:

The total average cost of outfitting U.S. and Canadian office space with medium-quality finishes ticked up just 2.7% in 2023, downshifting from the 10.1% jump seen in 2022, according to a recent report from the commercial real estate and investment management company JLL.

The average price tag for building out a medium-complexity open office floor plan project with small to medium-size workstations, and a 70/30 split between office/workstation seats and collaborative space, totaled $264 per rentable square foot in the U.S. last year, according to JLL’s U.S. & Canada Design Trends and Cost Guide. That’s up from $257 , according to the year-earlier report.

Contractors hungry to build business and the stabilizing cost of materials helped bring most of the components of office space outfitting back near pre-COVID-19 historical ranges, according to the report. One exception to moderating prices were tenant factors or choices — which comprise a small slice of the total cost but include office tech or AV equipment and systems — for which prices jumped 8.3% compared to 2022 when they held steady. For the broader nonresidential construction industry, average price inflation was roughly 4% for the same 2023 period, according to JLL.

Dive Insight:

The cost of transforming an office space from a shell into an inviting place to work is modulating as the broader U.S. office market is still reeling amid soaring office vacancies stemming from the shift toward hybrid and remote work since the pandemic. Many landlords are competing for office tenants by offering generous concessions as demand for offices have plummeted, CFO Dive previously reported.

Indeed, just a few years ago the change was something that might have been hard for the real estate industry to predict, Andrew Volz, Americas Research Manager, Project and Development Services at JLL, said in an interview. Now, what first took hold in the wake of pandemic closures appears to be sticking: the number of days workers in the U.S. and Canada are spending in the office hovers at just 3.1 days per week, with Wednesday being the most popular in-office day, according to the report.

That has left employers evaluating their workplaces and trying to upgrade their physical spaces to make them more flexible and spur productivity gains that will both draw more people back to the office, as well as to better support employees working with one another from both remote and on premises locations. “It’s here to stay and it’s being physically accommodated in the built environment,” Volz said, adding that companies are seeking to optimize their workplaces and make the experience of employees collaborating seamless.

The jump in tenant factor costs comes as companies are spending more on specialized tech, such as full-body videos that make collaborative virtual meetings feel more real, he said. Specific items in that portion of costs include video conferencing equipment, digital signage for desk/room reservations and sensors for smart facilities management.

There are ways CFOs can keep tenant factors down, Volz said. “Look to optimize, not omit,” he said in an email. “Technology like AV plays a pivotal role in enabling and supporting hybrid work, keeping employees connected whether working from home, from multiple offices or third locations. Prioritizing the right technology in the right spaces is key to controlling costs by investing in technology that drives performance.”

Still, there are other factors driving decisions about office space, the report says. Companies are also approaching fitting out their offices to meet their sustainability goals. For example, instead of developing a new 70,000 square-foot headquarters, JLL worked with a textile company to renovate an existing 40,000 square-foot building constructed in the 1960s in a project that included adding half of a fourth floor and a full-interior fit out. The environmental impact of the rehab was 42% lower than a new building, according to the report.",planning office expansion

There are so many different things to take into account when choosing the building that will house your workspaces. We have put together a checklist to guide your decisions and help you find the building that meets all your company’s requirements.

Are you looking to relocate your company office? This is a sensitive stage in your company’s development. To make this move a success, there are several important aspects to take into account. Although budget and timeline might seem like the most important aspects, there are a whole host of other factors to consider when choosing your future workplace.

It is crucial to identify your company’s requirements to make sure you choose the best possible building for your workstations. This audit of your requirements is the foundation of a successful company relocation.

To help you see clearly, we have created a four-step checklist to make your office move a success.

The logistics and administration involved in moving to a new office

These are the first things you need to consider when choosing a new location for your office. For this, you need to analyse your employees’ habits. “We run workshops on different topics to understand employees’ commuting habits: where they live, the transport they use, and so on,” explains Christine Rillaerts, a Buroconcept manager. “Then we look at strategic issues. Is it important for the company to stay in Brussels? Or do they want to move to a different region for tax or administrative reasons? Easy access to an airport is also important for logistics companies with international operations.”

Finally, you also need to think about the type of building you want. Do you want to move to a shared building with other companies or a private building that your company will have to itself?

Step one on this checklist narrows down the options, which will help you choose the buildings that will be the best fit for your company.

The workspace and the square footage you need

Space is the next point to consider. You need to work out how many square feet the company will need to accommodate the different workspaces and the accompanying logistics.

The increase in hybrid working (link to the hybrid working article) has profoundly changed how we work and makes it increasingly difficult to determine how much space you need. It has completely changed employees’ habits. In stark contrast to the traditional concept of work where an employee stays at their desk for the entire day, employees now move between several workplaces in that time including open-plan spaces, meeting rooms and their home office. This change must be taken into consideration when calculating the amount of space the different teams need.

It is important to look at the bigger picture and work out what space you will need for meeting rooms, desks, open-plan spaces, areas for exchanging ideas, and so on.

Once you have worked this out, you then need to consider the space itself. One of the key questions is the location of the partition walls that will separate the different workspaces within the building. This can change a project dramatically.

“The location of partition walls should depend on the building’s windows,” explains Christine Rillaerts. Let’s consider a building in which the smallest office has to be 2.4 metres wide due to the placement of the windows. Then compare that with a different building in which partition walls can only be put up every 1.8 metres due to the window placement. That is too narrow for someone to work in, which means that each office would have to be 3.6 metres wide. Over the entire side of the building, that’s a huge difference. How you configure your building’s layout has a significant impact on the success of your office relocation.”

Functional requirements for your company’s office relocation

The third item on the checklist for a successful office relocation relates to your functional requirements.

After looking at the bigger picture in the “space” step, now we need to take a much closer look at this workspace project. Let’s start by looking at light. A desk can only be a pleasant place to work if it benefits from natural light. Once again, the layout you choose will affect the amount of space you need significantly. “It is best to place desks within six metres of a window,” explains Christine Rillaerts. “By opting for an open-plan space, you can seat lots of employees within this area. If you place desks in individual offices instead, you will greatly reduce this number.” Beyond this six-metre area, spaces will be lit by borrowed light. This is where meeting rooms or logistics spaces should go. How many you choose will depend on your company’s requirements.

Looking at another example, if a building has a lot of columns, it will not be possible to create large meeting rooms. This will also affect how workspaces are laid out and where furniture can be placed.

This is why you need to work out your exact requirements to be able to assess whether a particular building is right for your company.

The technical aspects of your relocation

Step four on the checklist. Your office move is taking shape but there are now some constraints to take into account. These include ventilation, soundproofing, heating and lighting. There are a lot of technical aspects to consider.

You should keep in mind the age of the building. Old buildings used for offices do not comply with the same standards as modern office buildings, for example in relation to ventilation, heating, air conditioning and lighting.

Office buildings housed considerably fewer employees twenty years ago. This is because most people had their own offices at that point. Our modern open-plan offices enable more employees to work in one space. As a result, in technical terms, older buildings are not always adapted to the modern office. For example, there is sometimes not enough light or ventilation. This is a reality you will need to think about if you are considering an older building. There are also often additional costs to pay before you can move in.

Noise pollution should also be considered in this technical step. There are two aspects to noise pollution: sound absorption and sound transmission. Sound transmission is the way sounds are transmitted from one room to another, while absorption concerns resonance in rooms. Absorption varies hugely depending on the building materials used. Sound levels throughout the space may rise if meeting rooms and rooms designated for taking calls have insufficient soundproofing.

Environmental considerations and energy efficiency should also be taken into account when choosing the right building. Insulation has a huge effect on your financial calculations in terms of expenditure. The same goes for systems and devices that reduce your energy bills at the end of the month. For example, you will get real energy savings if the building has movement sensors installed to control the lights.

Including budget and timeline in the checklist

This comprehensive checklist will give you clarity for your property search. By clearly identifying your needs and working with an experienced office relocation company such as Buroconcept, you will narrow down your search and find an office that truly meets your company’s requirements.

Finances do of course need to be taken into account. However, by identifying your requirements precisely you will find a building that works for your company’s day-to-day operations and reduce the chance of any nasty surprises after you move in.

Finally, scheduling needs to be added to this equation too. The availability of the building will affect your choice, as will its general condition. Is it a turnkey building, under construction or in pristine condition with no renovations required? If extensive work needs to be done before delivery, your move-in date may be much later than you planned.",plans to move office

9,Open Plan Office 2.0: A Guide to Making the Transition - Blog,https://www.furniture-work.co.uk/blog/post/open-plan-office-2-0-a-guide-to-making-the-transition,,"Open plan office design has been popular for many years now, following a global shift in attitudes towards the traditional workspace. Open plan hasn’t been universally embraced, however. Not all employees feel comfortable in such a space, and if implemented without thought and care, open plan workspaces can actually harm productivity, efficiency and staff morale.

While it’s clear that open plan as a model for modern offices isn’t going away any time soon, there’s a new wave of design emerging. This is often called ‘open plan 2.0’, which builds on the basic principles of open plan design but with a great deal more consideration of different working styles and needs. Open plan 2.0 brings employees themselves into the discussion, and involves tailoring spaces to suit business objectives as well as transforming the workspace into a future-proofed and fully flexible environment.

Such a transformation can be a major change for any organisation and its employees, so it’s important to plan the process out carefully. It will inevitably revolutionise the way your company works, and such a change won’t necessarily happen overnight. Here’s our guide to making the transition, so you know what to plan for and what to expect…

Understanding what open plan 2.0 is all about

Making the shift to a new kind of open plan office design isn’t about gimmicky aesthetics or following trends. It has to be rooted in what your employees want, and their ways of working. At its heart, open plan 2.0 aims to create a variety of working environments to suit the different needs of your employees and the tasks they carry out every day. In one open plan space, you can zone and define specific working areas. For example, you could introduce:

Comfortable spaces for casual meetings and collaborative project working;

Booth-style workspaces for quiet phone calls or work requiring concentration;

Breakout-style seating and coffee bars - which facilitate socialising, relaxation, team bonding and collaboration all in the one space;

A variety of meeting spaces, all usable at a moment’s notice.

The design of such a space has to be done very carefully. It can be a challenge to include so much in one space, and to define each area carefully and equip it with what the users of the space will need. But it can be done, and done very successfully with the right design, choice of office furniture and plenty of input from employees.

Employee consultation

The first crucial stage in the transformation process is to consult your employees. Engaging them at this early point gives them a sense of ownership at the very start, which can alleviate fear of change and make the transition easier.

You also need employee input to find out what your new workspace needs to offer. Even a simple survey can yield a huge amount of valuable data about what is working and not working in your current space. It can tell you what staff members would put on their wishlist, what would help them to be happier and more productive, and crucially - how your employees actually work. You can identify trends and start to build a vision for what your new office will look like.

Crucial questions to be asking at this stage relate to personal space, the need for privacy and quiet, productivity and comfort (including light levels and temperature control).

Ongoing engagement

As you move into the design process, where you start to create and realise a vision for the new office space, it’s important to keep your employees engaged in the project. It is well worth setting up a committee made up of staff at all levels, including diversity in age, background and position, and schedule in regular meetings to update and feedback on how the project is going. Using the feedback from these sessions, you can match and align what your employees want with the goals for the organisation. There’s no point investing in a major project like this unless it’s actually going to work for your staff, the backbone of your company.

The design process

With a clear list of goals and must-haves, along with a vision for the space, you can start to work with a designer. You’ll be able to provide a detailed brief for the project, one that is backed by solid employee input and data, and not just what senior management think the workforce wants.

It’s at this stage you’ll discover the enormous variety of office furniture solutions available to you, and the flexibility of it too.

Modular furniture solutions

can be adjusted and adapted at any time, so the options you choose now don’t have to be absolutely perfect right away. It’s important not to be overwhelmed by the choice available, to focus on the brief and the needs of your workers when making decisions.

Another great way to engage employees at this stage is to offer options for personalisation wherever possible. If there’s a choice of colours, styles or configurations, why not give your employees the power to decide? As long as you don’t provide too many options and the choices fall in line with budget restrictions, the working committee (the cross-section of employees) can take ownership of some of these decisions and get a real sense of how the space will come together. It’ll create a feeling of excitement about the workspace too, which can make the change come as less of a shock (and more something to look forward to).

After the transformation

The work doesn’t stop once the renovation team have been in and the transformation is complete. There will inevitably be a settling in period, and possibly teething problems too. But once the dust has settled, it’s important to continue connecting with your team about their new workspace.

One good idea is to conduct the same or a similar survey to the one your employees completed at the very early stages of the project. Does the redesign meet their needs better now? What still needs improvement, and are there any areas that are under-used or working particularly well? These are all things such a survey could discover, so you can continue working in collaboration with your employees, as well as your designer and office furniture supplier, to evolve the workspace to meet your needs.",plans to open new office

And here’s everything you need to know.

What are the advantages of open plan offices?

Open plan office pros: flexibility

Open plan offices can make a space feel larger than it is – which is a must for small office spaces in London. And with so much room to play with, an open plan office means that you can adapt the space to work for your company. You can create different areas within the space to suit departments and working styles, such as:

– Collaborative spaces for exploring ideas

– Private areas for getting projects over the line

– Meeting areas for staff and clients

– All without the need for walls and multiple rooms.

Open plan office pros: tonnes of natural light

One of the big problems with traditional office spaces is that some of your team will get window desks, and others will be stuck with just headache-inducing fluorescent lights. By getting rid of the office walls, you can let your entire team bask in daylight. Not only does this create a more positive environment for both your team and clients and increase your staff’s health, wellbeing and happiness, but it can help you save on your electricity bill in the long run.

Open plan office pros: collaboration and creativity

Removing walls does more than just let everyone enjoy the daylight. It breaks barriers both physically and metaphorically, to allow for far better collaboration between team members and management.

Communication between team members and different departments happens far more freely and more informally, which allows for a better flow of information and ideas. Not needing to knock on doors for a quick question or idea saves time and boosts productivity.

Open plan office pros: budget-friendly

Generally, open plan office spaces are cheaper to rent. By not having walls, businesses can save on:

– Heating

– Air conditioning

– Lighting

Open plan offices also allow businesses to quickly expand and handle personnel changes, as the spaces can adapt to changes without needing to find a new, bigger office space.

What are the disadvantages of open plan offices?

Open plan office cons: can become noisy

One of the downsides of not having walls in an office is that noise travels. Some people may find it difficult to concentrate with more communication between team members, phones ringing, and keyboards clattering.

But there are some easy ways to counter the noise within an office:

– Set up quiet areas for your staff to focus

– Put a headphones policy in place that acts as a do not disturb signal (bonus: studies show that 71% of staff say they are more productive when they use their headphones at work)

– Create breakout spaces for collaboration separate from the main office space

Open plan office cons: privacy

The lack of office walls means that communication between colleagues and managers is far easier and open. But it can be difficult for staff that may want to have a private or confidential discussion.

To solve this problem, many modern open plan offices have meeting rooms and private spaces so that employees can have those private one-to-ones without worrying that the whole office can hear them. Having these spaces means that if anything isn’t quite right or a team member is anxious about discussing something openly, they have a safe space to explore it.

Find the perfect open plan office in London for your business

As open plan offices are the most popular type of office, there’s a lot of choice available. But not all open plan offices are equal and you’ll need to consider what your business needs from an office before renting a space. To get the ball rolling, it’s a good idea to consider:

– What utilities does the lease include?

– Does it have meeting rooms and breakout areas?

– What other facilities are available: kitchen? Showers?

– Is Wifi included? Is it high speed?

– Does it have 24/7 reception access?

While the above are all important considerations, one of the biggest decisions you’ll need to make is the location of your new open plan office. Location plays a massive role in your brand’s image and can have an instant impact on potential clients. Plus, having an office in the middle of nowhere will mean your team won’t enjoy the commute.

To give you a hand in choosing a location, we’ve shone the spotlight on some of the best open plan spaces available in London right now.

Call it ‘open plan 2.0.’

There’s a new wave of office design emerging that is better tailored for individual work styles and collaboration needs. This shift follows the initial pushback of the open-plan craze that rolled in quickly, pulling offices and larger workstations out and dropping bench seating in its place.

The open plan of the future now looks beyond the personal footprint to make sure individual work areas are married seamlessly with the surrounding spaces and overall environment to create an authentic sense of community and culture that embraces different types of work styles. Between generational shifts—bringing new preferences on how an office should look and feel—and technology advances—allowing folks to literally work from anywhere—companies are challenged more than ever to create a space that draws employees in, nurtures a sense of community, and supports collaboration.",planning new office location
25,Open plan office design ideas - London office spaces,https://canvasoffices.co.uk/open-plan-office-design/,,"Designing your open plan office is an exciting opportunity to tell your employees and your clients who you are as a business. Much like your home, your office will serve to give a little insight into your personality and taste. For your team, it will help illustrate the culture you endorse and continue to nurture.

Open plan office design, especially in London, was in many ways inspired by startup work environments and the incredible results so many of them achieve with their teams. This often begins in the culture that a business builds – and office environment is instrumental in culture building.

Whether you consider yourself a creative company or not does not matter when it comes to your selection of an office space, as actually, people like to take pride in where they work no matter the discipline. The key to finding an office that appeals to the needs of every character in your team is to ensure that the space allows for as much flexibility to create a little something for everyone.

Consider investing in soft furnishings like rugs, cushions and bean bags – along with a variety of plants and flowers – to create a comforting and beautiful space. Plants are particularly popular as they are fantastic for the quality of air in office spaces and bring a touch of the outdoors, in.

Find Your Next Office At Canvas, we create homely workspaces for large & small teams. We include everything (meeting rooms too) with a simple flexible contract.

Open plan office design – a flexible workspace

One of the most important attributes in modern workspaces is the ability to create comforting hubs and hangouts that resemble similar comforts of home. As pictured above from our Office Space in Shoreditch, introducing sofas and other lounge furniture replicates that of a living room – offering flexibility to the team. These spaces can be used to have meetings, take breaks, or to inspire the same creativity that comes from sitting on your own sofa among friends.

Creating these spaces in a bustling office also allows team members to take short breaks when they need to clear their heads or reprioritise for the day. Let’s not forget the additional perk of being able to host clients and partners in your workspace – they’ll have the luxury of being comfortable while also being able to observe the team and office dynamic you’ve built.

Open plan office design – create a space to collaborate

As seen in our Luke Street, Shoreditch based offices, collaboration spaces can often begin by simply banking teams together in desk clusters. Think about the ways in which you can enable teams to work and engage with each other with ease. The simplest way of doing this is to ensure they’re sat together, particularly with productivity in mind. Instead of waiting for meetings to get quick answers for live projects, the team can raise questions and thoughts at the desk. It also allows for other team members to weigh in on discussions they may overhear and be able to contribute to.

What is great about renting an office space, is that you can quite often adopt an open plan layout to your changing needs. By investing in agile ways of working, you’ll very quickly be able to adapt depending on what comes next for your business. Desk banks can be extended or separated, storage units can be moved and in many cases, additional space can be purchased.

Open plan office design – privacy hubs and focus booths

Privacy hubs or focus booths, as they’re often coined, are essential to open plan office design. These pods, as illustrated above in our Shoreditch High Street workspaces, are highly recommended for both small and large offices. They offer the opportunity for team members to knuckle down and meet challenging deadlines, deal with sensitive tasks and information and take the space they need to take a personal call – without the need to leave the building.

We must also factor in an element of a work/life balance and by adding a touch of privacy to open plan offices, team members are able to ensure they’re contactable for the important elements of their private lives.

Open plan office design – fixed desks vs hot desking

Many London teams work alongside agency staff or team members from different locations across the UK and the world. By ensuring you have a collection of hot desks, you’re able to account for the need to offer space on an ad hoc basis. These spaces, similar to the ones pictured above in our offices in Dalston Lane, are extremely adaptable. They can also be used as lunch desks when not in use, or again, as little break out areas for concentration and moments away from the desk.

Hot desking was a particularly popular design for office spaces in recent years, however, there are benefits to being able to call a desk yours. A sense of belonging and ownership can do a great deal to your motivations – so when you are designing your space, ensure you factor in the right desk to person ratio for the team you have.

Open plan office design – meeting rooms

Open plan environments may not always cater for meeting spaces, and the need for these is inevitable. There are many ways that you may be able to partition an open plan office, however sound and privacy might become issues. It’s worth considering including a private meeting room in your brief to your office manager, even if you decide to go for one that is shared between teams.

As shown above in our Luke Street office space, you are able to maintain your policy and commitment to transparency in your office designs, by opting for a workspace with floor to ceiling windows. While the sound won’t travel, the team has visibility on the activity within the office.

12,Open space - NSW Department of Planning,https://www.planning.nsw.gov.au/policy-and-legislation/open-space,,"Open space is the foundation of liveable communities. Public open space is infrastructure that is essential for communities and creating great places to live. It encompasses parks, natural areas and linkages, waterways and foreshores, informal parklands, sports grounds and courts, playspaces, historical sites, and recreation trails for walking and cycling. It is found in every part of NSW — from remote regional towns to new greenfield suburbs, and long-established urban centres. Well-connected open space plays a crucial ecological, economic, social and cultural role in our lives.

The department is delivering a range of open space projects across NSW, including new and improved parks across Greater Sydney through the Parks for People program, places to swim and get adventurous in nature supported by the Open Spaces Program, as well as over 140 inclusive playspaces influenced by the Everyone Can Play program, delivered in partnership with councils.

People with access to public open space are healthier and happier than those without. For many people living without access to a backyard, the open spaces in our communities are vital to maintain physical and mental health.

Public Open Space Strategy for NSW

The Public Open Space Strategy for NSW (PDF, 14.3 MB) is a major step to deliver more and better public open space that the community can access, use, enjoy and belong to. It sets out a collaborative, coordinated and evidence-based approach for government agencies to plan, invest and deliver public open space – resulting in more effective and efficient outcomes.

When planning new office space, look for sites with large floor plates to increase team connection and reduce the physical distance between colleagues. These sites are also more cost effective, as you don't need to duplicate infrastructure on multiple floors. Ideally you want spaces with minimal building core functions (for example, lifts, fire stairs) and columns protruding into the usable workspace.

Maximise natural light by placing open-plan areas around floor perimeters or close to atriums. Where possible, keep the core of the building for enclosed spaces, like utility bays and meeting rooms.

Centralise facilities like large collaborative spaces, utility areas, and kitchens on each floor around the main entry, lifts or stairs. This enables casual interactions and impromptu meetings, and helps to reduce disruption to work areas.",new office space planning
34,Open-plan offices and the failure to flex,https://www.ie-uk.com/blog/open-plan-offices-failure,,"How do you solve a problem like a silo? How do you help an agile team to thrive? With an open plan office design? That’s certainly been one response to the modern need for a more integrated, cross-functional approach to team work.

“Open plan is pretty spectacular. It ensures that everyone is attuned to the broad mission, and it encourages curiosity between people who work in different disciplines.” Josh Tyrangiel, editor of Bloomberg Businessweek

Ever since Michael Bloomberg opened his media HQ in Manhattan in the 1980s, the corporate world has been fascinated by the idea of open-plan as a solution to intransigent and atrophying business cultures.

In this new work paradigm the intention was for employees, at last, to see and hear each other freely, to facilitate intense teamwork; for everything within the workplace to be open, observable and transparent.

Institutional eavesdropping

For Michael Bloomberg, it was a world where workers could “absorb information peripherally while focusing elsewhere”; a phenomenon described by another of his staff as “institutional eavesdropping.”

And if that sounds slightly sinister to you - treading a thin line between encouraging accountability and enabling surveillance - this description of the Bloomberg design in practice, might well confirm your suspicions:

“Row upon row of workstations fan out along endless tables in massive atriums with few dividers to break up the space. On the rare occasion when some sort of partition becomes necessary (for example, to delineate a conference room) the favoured material is clear glass that may block noise but does not obscure vision”

From, The Boss with no Office, 2014

The C-Suite comes out into the open

But if open plan was intended to make individuals and teams more accountable, it also aimed to bring the C-suite out into the open, too, with CEOs setting up desks in the midst of their workforce.

This stressed the idea of accessibility and even the breaking down of traditional hierarchies and privilege, a means of championing the primacy of the team. It’s a practice that the social media Titans, Zuckerberg and Dorsey still follow today.

The success of open plan?

So successful has the open plan philosophy been, this work style is now ubiquitous - according to Steelcase - 69% of offices now have an open floor plan,

However, as the employees of Bloomberg themselves soon discovered and a recent Havard Business School (HBS) study has demonstrated, open plan has simply recast the problem of facilitating teamwork and introduced new obstacles to wellbeing and productivity in the process.

In fact, almost as soon as open-plan became the new normal in businesses across the world, research began to point out flaws in the project.

Why open plan makes us sick

There were certainly more conversations happening between team members but less of any significance because of concerns about privacy. Constant visibility meant there was a general, related rise in anxiety, sickness and absenteeism. Terrible acoustics led to preposterous noise cancelling solutions.

And even though teams had been transposed from individual offices into a single room or floor - they were still located in fixed positions within those floors, workers were still tied to their desks and their computers for the completion of tasks; able to confer with colleagues, but not in any heightened or more meaningful ways than before.

In fact, the HBS study found that open offices reduced face-to-face interaction by about 70% and increased email and messaging by roughly 50%, shattering the notion that they make workers collaborative.

Ironically, open plan still proved a rigid and inflexible solution for businesses that aspired to be agile. It couldn’t bend, change and flex according to the needs of the individuals who worked within it.

Open plan, it seemed, fed disengagement, inhibited team work, cut off access to privacy and actually created discomfort.

Cost effective and easy to grow into

Still, the idea of using large, single spaces to house workers, leasing or buying whole floors without permanent subdivisions, was a cost effective idea and has remained attractive to businesses ever since.

That’s why tech start ups in the noughties internet boom ended up choosing stripped down warehouses and loftspaces as the settings for their ventures - they were inexpensive and easy to grow into - and inadvertently spawned a shabby chic design aesthetic in the process.

How to make open plan spaces work

But the real key as to how to make these spaces work, may lie in an earlier phase of commercial thinking.

In 1959, the visionary architect Edward Parkes, building a cutting edge technical facility in the UK city of Leicester, realised nothing in his designs should be fixed:

“An engineering laboratory if not a static thing, its purpose and content change, often at an alarming rate, with the passage of time. Anything which limits adaptability for the future is, as far as possible to be avoided’ Edward Parkes, Architect, 1959

And it seems this observation has become true for the endlessly evolving and transforming businesses of today, too. In the age of Agile working, hyperconnectivity and rapidly superseded technology, the needs of individuals and teams are changing constantly. The purpose and content of our work can alter on a daily or hourly basis.

The future of open plan reimagined - endlessly configurable spaces

Configure and reconfigure

There is now a real need to constantly configure and reconfigure a workspace on the fly, to support the changing activity, technologies and behaviours that it is required to host. But most offices, even those that are open plan, are currently unequal to this challenge.

This inflexibility has led to a kind of nomadism within a typical office space, with groups and individuals searching fruitlessly for space where they can complete the tasks required of them. Recent Steelcase research has shown that although 77% of people have their own assigned work station, 87% spend to two to four hours every day working somewhere else. Meanwhile, 53% of workers say they can’t find the spaces they need in their current office to perform at their best.

Open plan has historically failed to deliver the right conditions for teams whose needs shift between collaborative work, private meetings, concentrated individual focus, and larger team gatherings.

But it’s not the open space itself that is at fault, but what we do with it and how we choose to fill it that is causing the problem.

So now, thinkers and designers are beginning to reimagine furniture solutions that make the most of the open plan spaces we have.

“Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, as is traditional in open plan design, work environments should provide various options that support employees working effectively.” Katharine Schwab, The Fast Company

Instead of fixed, immovable, workstations, chairs and desks - cutting edge designers are advocating a new breed of furniture solution which enables the office to change around us.

In this new world we will be able to maximise our efficiency and productivity through an endless ability to flex.",plans to open new office

459,Opening New Offices: Tips for Successful Branch Expansion,https://www.bcgsearch.com/article/60266/Opening-Branch-offices/,,"When a business is ready to expand its operations, it often must consider the pros and cons of setting up a branch office in a new location. Whether the expansion is minor or large, the decision to create an extension of the business must be weighed carefully and involves a number of considerations. In the past, most businesses had to physically set up shop in a new city or country and staff it with qualified professionals to carry out its operations. But with today's technology and the emergence of remote offices, there are a variety of ways to open up a branch office.When looking to set up a branch office, it's important to consider the business climate in the chosen city or country and how it affects the long-term success of this venture. Issues such as a countryâ€™s labor laws, tax regulations and cultural norms should be taken into account when making any decisions. For international businesses, it is also vital to consider the logistics of cross-border shipping, import/export protocols and the cost of foreign currency exchange. Additionally, the physical location of the office is important when selecting a space that is large enough to operate the business.When establishing a branch office, business owners must carefully look at the structure of their organization and determine who will manage the branch. If a business hiring a manager from within, it is important for them to analyze the professionalâ€™s experience, qualifications, and leadership ability to determine if they are an appropriate fit. Alternatively, the business can consider the use of virtual offices and third-party recruiters to hire remote employees.When done correctly, setting up a branch office in a new location has numerous long-term benefits. It allows a business to break into new markets, expand its customer base, and generate more revenue. Additionally, a branch office allows a company to create a presence in a different location and build brand recognition in the region. Law firms around the world have opened thousands of new branch offices over the past decade. While many of these branch offices have been successful, numerous branch offices have also suffered failure. Every American, Asian, or European firm that seriously competes for work from multinational corporations is considering or has already pursued plans to open a branch office.

Summary: Opening a branch office is a great way for businesses to expand their operations beyond their home base. It provides an opportunity to reach new markets and customers and tap into the potential of a new geographic area. Taking the step of opening a branch office is a major decision, however, and requires careful planning and preparation. When deciding on whether or not to open a branch office, businesses should assess the potential benefits of doing so. These include having a physical presence in a new region that can be used for sales and marketing, cultivating stronger relationships with existing customers, and establishing access to new talent pools. Additionally, businesses should consider the cost factors associated with such a move, including the upfront investment required, ongoing operational costs, the strain on existing resources, the need for legal advice and other compliance factors. Once the decision to open a branch office has been made, the next step is to perform a feasibility analysis. This should include defining the purpose and objectives for the office, determining the necessary personnel and skill requirements, examining the expected cost of setup and ongoing operations, and reviewing any local business and regulatory laws. Additionally, businesses should research the local market to determine whether there is sufficient demand and opportunity to make the venture worthwhile. From there, businesses will need to develop a business plan and budget to ensure the office meets their goals. This should include outlining the specific services they will offer, determining pricing and staffing models, and setting up the necessary infrastructure. Additionally, businesses should consider local incentives available, such as tax credits, to help reduce any potential costs. Lastly, businesses need to consider the necessary legal and administrative requirements to establish a branch office. These include applying for permits, hiring employees, and setting up banking and accounting services. Additionally, businesses will need to ensure that all employees at the new office are adequately trained and familiar with procedures and protocols. In conclusion, opening a branch office is a major undertaking that requires careful planning and thoughtful consideration of all relevant factors. By taking the time to properly assess the potential benefits and costs, as well as complying with all legal and administrative requirements, businesses can ensure that their expansion efforts are successful. Growth is essential to the long-term survival of any business, whether it is opening a company in the USA, internationally, or expanding company offices. American and foreign law firms have grown by marketing to the public, acquiring lateral partners with portable practices, merging with other firms, and starting new branch offices.

227,Our Office Relocation Tips: What Do You Need To Consider?,https://www.oaktreeoffice.com/office-relocation-tips-our-top-considerations-when-looking-for-the-perfect-office-space/,,"You’re starting the process of relocating offices. Maybe a lease end is upcoming, or you’ve outgrown your current space. Whatever the reason, there are many factors to consider, all of which contribute to the success and ease of your relocation.



Let’s break down these factors and discuss our office relocation tips to help ensure you find the perfect office space.

Why Is It Important To Choose The Right Office Space?

When starting the office relocation process, it’s vital that you choose the right space for your company and your requirements.

Your office space isn’t just a location, it’s a reflection of your business. It’s where employees spend a significant portion of their time, so it needs to positively impact employee productivity and company culture.

Assessing Your Needs

Before thinking about the physical office space you’re going to be moving into, you need to define your business goals and objectives.

Are you aiming for business growth and expansion or planning to maximise profits? Consider how your office space can support these objectives.

Then, you need to determine your budget. This is one of our first office relocation tips and is high on the priority list. It’s essential to have a comprehensive overview of all ongoing expenses. Make sure to factor in costs, such as; utilities, maintenance, insurance, property taxes, fit-out costs, moving services, etc.

It’s also a good idea to include a contingency fund in your budget to account for unexpected expenses. This safety net can provide peace of mind and prevent financial strain.

Next, it’s time to identify your space requirements.

Are you aiming for rapid growth? If so, you’ll need a space that can accommodate an expanding workforce.

Calculate the square footage required for your office space. Taking into account workstations, common areas, meeting rooms, kitchen facilities, and storage spaces.



Consult with employees, providing valuable insights into their space requirements.

Checklist for Choosing The Right Space

The next of our office relocation tips is all about choosing the right physical space for your office.

Location Considerations

Public transport – How near are the bus stations/stops, tube stations and train stations to the office? Is the office walking distance from the stations? How easy is it for your employees to commute via public transport?

Airport transport – Do you have a global presence? Will your employees need to fly for business? Think about how far your new office is from the airport, to ensure travel is efficient and hassle-free.

Food – Where can employees go during their lunch break? Are there lots of food options? Are there suitable places to host clients?

Competitors – Will you be located near any of your competitors? Will this cause any issues?

Clients – If you’re regularly visiting your clients’ offices, are they close to your new office or far away? If they’re too far away, employees may spend too much time travelling, rather than actually meeting with clients.

Employee commute – Consider the impact on your employees for their new commute. Is the commute busy, stressful or long? What are the traffic patterns like? You don’t want employees to arrive in a negative mood, due to a stressful commute, and you must consider their wellbeing.

IT Infrastructure Considerations

Data centre – Will you require a data centre in the office? Think about the size of the space if you need a comms room, and where the best place to position it will be.

Internet connectivity – Practically all businesses nowadays require internet connection. How fast is the internet? What’s internet connectivity like?

Efficiency Considerations

Energy efficient – How efficient is the building? This is a very important part of our office relocation tips, and should be taken into careful consideration. When selling/renting a building, the landlord must give you an EPC (Environmental Performance Certificate) which will give you an idea how energy efficient the space is. This is a legal requirement. Get an idea of energy costs from the landlord, or previous tenants Ensure the space has double glazing, to help you reduce the cost of your energy bills.

– How efficient is the building? This is a very important part of our office relocation tips, and should be taken into careful consideration.

Light – How much natural light is in the space? This can improve employee productivity and well-being, and also reduce energy costs.

The Building

Disabled access – It’s a legal requirement that your space meets the current Disability Discrimination Act regulations. This Act was replaced in 2010 by the Equality Act, so make sure the space meets all of the latest requirements. Read more about the Equality Act

– It’s a legal requirement that your space meets the current Disability Discrimination Act regulations. This Act was replaced in 2010 by the Equality Act, so make sure the space meets all of the latest requirements.

Security – Is the building secure? Will you require extra security systems? How safe is the neighborhood? Staff need to feel safe and secure at all times.

Parking – Are there enough parking spaces available for employees and visitors? If not on-site, is there sufficient off-site parking?

Outside building condition – What does the external condition of the building say about your business? Is it well kept, or are upgrades required?

Noise – Does the space echo? Is it located next to a train station or in an airport flight path? Noise can be very distracting for employees and reduce productivity. Acoustic treatment can be applied to reduce the effects of noise pollution, will this need to be included in the fit-out of the space?

Cost Considerations

Fit-out costs/furniture costs – Does the space require a professional fit-out to upgrade, personalise or treat any issues? Will you move old furniture with you, or will you be purchasing new furniture to fit new company branding?

How Do You Prepare Employees For An Office Move?

In this part of our office relocation checklist, we’ll discuss how to prepare employees for the transition to a new office.

Allow your employees to familiarise themselves with the new space.

Give them an induction to the new space and discuss new safety and security protocols.

Schedule the move strategically and ensure it doesn’t clash with any important events or dates.

Provide temporary workspace solutions, or ask employees to work from home for a period of time to minimise disruption to their working day and productivity, if there is lots of movement in the office.

How Do I Move Employees To A New Office?

Finally, we’ll look at our tips for moving employees to a new office and our checklist for an office relocation.

Plan the transition to the new space. Prepare and provide a timeline of events and assemble a moving team to take charge of the move.

Communicate with your employees – keep them informed at all times, and address any concerns or questions they may have.

Ask for employee input – to make sure employees are being heard, ask for their input on the moving process. Employees need to be satisfied and comfortable to improve well-being and productivity Involving more people in the process will allow you to come up with innovative and more efficient solutions – two heads are better than one!



Upon moving in, ensure you provide employees with a proper induction, and provide them with orientation assistance.

10,Our bright and shiny new office! | Layout,https://getflywheel.com/layout/life-at-flywheel/our-bright-and-shiny-new-office/,,"When Flywheel first started, we were just a few people in a coworking space. In 2014, we hit a major milestone and moved into our very own downtown office. At the time, the 10 employees that made up Flywheel couldn’t imagine ever outgrowing our one-floor headquarters. But as you’ve probably noticed, we’ve done a LOT of growing over the last couple years – meaning our office needed to grow, too!

Over the past year, we transformed our one-floor office into a three-story headquarters with 7,500 extra square feet to accommodate all of our creativity and growth. We are so incredibly proud of what our space has become, so we wanted to take you on a little virtual tour!

The first order of business was to extend our office vertically, with two extra floors. Naturally, the only way to do that is to add a staircase, which meant we needed to cut out a huge hole in the floor. So we did!

Once we had access to the new space, we knew we needed to add more conference rooms while still leaving plenty of room for each team to grow. We struck a balance and added five brand new rooms that are perfect for team meetings, along with a few other spaces to help employees get away from their desks.

The theme of each room was inspired by our beautiful brand guide, which made it easy to pick out the colors. To help control the sound, we also had custom-made, sound dampening panels installed, featuring some of our very own employees and photography!

Of our new rooms, one has an extra special purpose that we’re extremely excited about. The yellow room may look like just a lounge area, but it’s actually a maternity room for new mothers! It comes with extra soundproofing, it’s own Sonos speaker, a mini fridge, snacks, floor-to-ceiling curtains, and most importantly, the cutest pics around of some of our precious office pups.

Some of the other highlights in the office include our creative chalkboard wall in the kitchen, the beautiful new entry, and our favorite motto painted on the first floor: We <3 designers!

Once the construction was complete, the painting was finished, and the artwork was hung, we threw a party to celebrate! Our open house allowed us to give tours of the new space, show off our sweet setup, and enjoy drinks with friends and family from near and far.

We went all out with a candy and popcorn bar, three kegs of local beer, and wonderful wines of all kinds! And to top it all off, our in-house DJ, Eric, filled the building with groovy beats all night long.

We sure do love our shiny new office space, and are so thrilled to see how it continues to grow!",plans to open new office

Originally established in 1983, the new building will reflect today’s work environment.

Pepperl+Fuchs, Inc. Announces New Innovative North American Office

TWINSBURG, Ohio - June 2024 - The Pepperl+Fuchs US Division is getting a new home. The new 25,000-square-foot office building will house approximately 120 employees and will be constructed in Twinsburg, Ohio, just a short distance from the current location. A second US location, the US Distribution Center, is located in Katy, Texas.



As a global leader in factory and process automation, Pepperl+Fuchs’ new office has been designed to meet the needs of both employees and the world’s changing work environment. How we work, where we work and how we communicate with one another has changed drastically in recent years. The new facility takes these changes into account, embraces them and integrates them into everyday working life.



Work21@ Pepperl+Fuchs is a new, future-oriented concept that is at the heart of the construction of the new headquarters and focuses on collaboration between colleagues. Collaborative environments encourage the exchange of ideas from diverse perspectives, leading to innovative solutions and creative problem solving. The new building’s open workspace will facilitate access to coworkers from different departments and encourage activity-based working over function-based working. This type of workspace allows for multiple tasks and activities in one area, more knowledge sharing and interaction, and improved corporate communication.



The spaces will be designated for focused work, communication, collaboration and recreation. Each space will have a specific purpose and will transform the way work is accomplished at Pepperl+Fuchs. This means not only a new building, but also embracing a new way of working in the 21st century.



“We are excited about the possibilities this new building offers. Not only will we have a fresh new space for our Twinsburg location, we will also be able to embrace the future of work head-on and be prepared for what comes next,” said Robert Smith, COO of Pepperl+Fuchs. “Our local work21 group and the global cross-functional group have spent months working with an employee-centered agency to develop our new work concept; one that focuses on organizational growth, the evolution towards hybrid work demands, and a positive work-life balance. Today’s digital working environment and hybrid work schedules have been uniquely meshed into the design of our new building. We look forward to continuing to set the standard for automation excellence in this redesigned workspace and developing some of the most innovative automation solutions in the world.”



The groundbreaking ceremony took place in May 2024 and the project is expected to be completed in late 2025.

For an additional fee, the Expedited Plan Review Team will allow developers and others seeking a building permit to schedule a meeting with a plan review team and their design professionals within two weeks of submitting plans. The plans will be reviewed with the design professionals present, giving them the opportunity to make any necessary corrections on the spot and potentially have a permit issued in one sitting. Contact the X-Team for additional information.

Standard Plan Review

City plan review staff members review building permit applications in the order in which they have been submitted. These applications have all required submittal elements. Our goal is to provide you with a full set of comments on your application is 7 business days, this timeframe can vary based on the volume of work in the plans examiners queue.

Simultaneous Construction Plan and Plat Review

Our current process requires that the plat be completed and recorded at the County prior to submittal of any building permit application. Having the plat finalized means that when the site plans are initially reviewed easements, floodplains, right of way dedications, property lines and any other encumbrances to the property are firmly set. City staff can review a building permit application with a proposed plat after the final plat application has been submitted to the City. Reviewing plans prior to plat recording will mean that adjustments to the construction plans may need to be made. When reviewing construction plans with a proposed plat staff has identified five divisions that will need to review the same permit information twice, once with the proposed plat and a second time with the finalized plat. This double-touch of the plans will necessitate an additional fee for building plan submittal prior to plat recording. These permit applications are reviewed in the order in which they have been submitted. No building permits will be issued until the final plat is recorded at the County.

The new office will be headed by Alvin Ling, vice president of sales and operations at Pixalate, with over 20 years of technical experience in digital advertising in the region. In his role, he will head the company’s APAC workforce.

Pixalate provides ad fraud protection technologies, local client support, APIs for developers, and an analytics platform that has been recognised by the MRC in order to cater to the regional market. Since the region has seen a rise in both ad spending and invalid traffic (IVT), which includes ad fraud, many APAC countries have stepped up their efforts to prevent sophisticated ad fraud.

Pixalate has also partnered with several worldwide businesses operating in APAC, including Pangle, TikTok for Business’s ad network, which is owned by Bytedance. Pangle recently announced that it has upgraded its mobile ad platform to include Pixalate’s Third-Party Content Risk Assessment, providing global advertisers with brand protection and media transparency.

Speaking about the expansion, Jalal Nasir, CEO of Pixalate, said, “Advertising fraud is a global concern, posing an ever-evolving threat that continues to grow in size, scale, and sophistication. We are thrilled to launch our 3-D anti-fraud technology and operations in APAC to ensure the safety and security of our partners.”

Meanwhile, Ling stated, “I am honoured to lead the growth of Pixalate’s APAC team and partnerships at a crucial inflection point for the region. Our unparalleled technology tools and exceptional team are uniquely positioned to serve the market’s needs at a time when the industry’s heightened emphasis on a more white-boxed global fraud protection solution and supply path object verification has spurred strong demand for greater transparency and improved traffic quality.”",upcoming office expansion

When it comes to office design, good planning is essential. A good office design improves productivity and contributes to the well-being of your employees. It should reflect your company and how you like to work, both internally and with your customers.

Believe it or not, the average adult spends over 50% of their daytime hours in an office. It’s the central part of our day and often the place we spend the most time in. This is why, in addition to functioning well, we want an office design that creates a pleasant and inviting place to spend time in.

With some thoughtful planning, you can achieve both… but where do you start?

There is a lot of office planning advice out there, but how do you know what will work in your actual office space? One of the best ways to figure that out is with a digital office planner. The RoomSketcher App is a great online tool to use for planning your office design. Create layouts, try out different ideas, find furniture and more!

Office Planning Made Easy

Sounds great, right? In truth, office planning can be really challenging, there are lots of different needs to consider and bring together. However, this can be made a lot easier when you can see your ideas and options clearly. All you need is the right tools.

With a RoomSketcher subscription, you can plan and visualize your office in 3D and create 2D and 3D Floor Plans and 3D Photos of your office design ideas.

Try out different office designs and find solutions that work. Plus, integrated sharing features make it easy for you to share the design with other employees, as well as with any contractors and office furniture suppliers you may need.

Create a Floor Plan – Quickly and Easily

The best way to start an office design is with a floor plan. Floor plans are an important tool to see what will fit in your office space and what won’t.

With RoomSketcher, drawing an office floor plan is easy. You can draw your floor plan from scratch or choose a template to start with. Layout your walls, adjust the room sizes and add any windows, doors and stairs with the easy-to-use drag and drop drawing tool.

What’s really cool is that while you draw your floor plan, a 3D model of it is being created at the same time. So, you can see how your office design looks in 3D as you go.

When office planning, it’s good to create two versions of your floor plan one of the existing floor plan and one with your new design. Having both will help furniture salespeople, suppliers, contractors and movers to see more accurately what the needs are. This will save you time and money when getting estimates.

Top RoomSketcher Tip! Short on time? Kick-start your project by ordering a floor plan from our expert illustrators. You’ll get it back next business day. Then, just open the project in the RoomSketcher App and start designing.

Try Different Layouts

There are many different ways of working now that require different types of office layouts – from traditional cellular office layouts, to open office or team style layouts. In addition to workstations, there are also many new ways of integrating meeting areas into office layouts that are both casual and formal. To figure out which is best for your office design, you will want to create several different layouts to review and compare.

For inspiration, check out these different types of office layouts.

With a digital office planner like the RoomSketcher App, creating layout options is easy. Simply add a new level to your project. Your floor plan will be copied over so there is no need to draw again – just click and create your new option. Start by creating basic zones, then add more detail to your office layout as you go. The integrated measurement tools will show your zone sizes and room sizes so that you can layout out your spaces with the proper clearances.

Top RoomSketcher Tip! When creating your office design don’t forget storage. Storage is often overlooked when planning an office. Having a well thought out plan for your office storage needs will greatly contribute to the success of your design.

Choose Fixtures and Furniture

The RoomSketcher product library has more than 7,000 brand-name and generic products to choose from. Try different styles of desks, meeting tables, task chairs, lounge seating, shelving, and more. And don’t forget about lighting! Workstations need task lights and decorative lights are a great way to create focal points in meeting and reception areas.

Design and Decorate

Once you have your office layout, you can add finishes to the floor, walls and ceiling. Just click the Materials button and select a material, such as wood, tile, carpet or concrete. Find your favorites and drag it into place on your floor plan. You can also match paint and other solid colors using the color picker. OR create custom colors of your own to match your brand or to create a signature look.

Visualize Your Office Design in 3D!

What is really unique about the RoomSketcher App, is that you can create amazing 3D images. Take snapshots of any part of your office design in 3D with the integrated camera tool. Create wide-angle views or zoom-in to view areas in more detail. Save snapshots to review and compare.

Get a “true” feel for how your office will actually look and feel. There’s no better way to visualize your office design and find solutions that work!

507,PlanSA,https://plan.sa.gov.au/,,"The list below details the most common and frequently asked questions in relation to the DAP. Please note, for technical assistance with the DAP your first point of action should be to refer to the support library. Alternatively, you can contact the PlanSA Service Desk staff for assistance on PlanSA@sa.gov.au or call 1800 752 664.

What is required on the digital “approved” stamp, the date, the council’s name – I have attached ours for your comment. Do we need the ID number, and reference to the PDI Act? There are no minimum requirements for stamps (used for stamped plans) however the below is an example of good practice:

What is meant by “clearance requirement” in the portal? (Found in Conditions and Advisory Notes section of the application) These are the conditions that need to be met for the Certificate Title to be created/presented in the case of a land division. An example of one of these conditions is the payment of the “open space waiver”, but there are many more. This type of enquiry would be best handled by the land divisions team (contactable via PlanSA Service Desk Option#3) if they need to clarify the specific conditions.

Where can I obtain a ""Digital"" Stamp? You may source your own software or create one yourself however we recommend ""Bluebeam"". Their website is www.bluebeam.com/au/

Why is GST on some Planning fees and not others, and the same for Building fees? GST is not charged for a service that only the council or state government can provide. For example the lodgement fee for a DA (development application) or a performance assessed application fee. If the service can be done privately (e.g. a deemed-to-satisfy application) this will have GST included even if it is being processed by the council so as to keep competition on price relatively equal.

Will the DAP/ePlanning platform decide which category of assessment an application falls within? Depending on the entry criteria selected. For example, selecting a parcel of land, or nominating a specific type of development, such as a shed. Answering a series of criteria-based questions will return a suggested pathway for users, along with the relevant rules, according to the Planning and Design Code. This will then be verified and confirmed by the relevant authority prior to lodgement (timing of commencement of this function TBC).

Is there a period of time during which an application has been lodged to check it has been lodged correctly? Once submitted, applications must be reviewed by the relevant authority to confirm that they are properly made and are allocated to the correct category. This process is known as ‘verification’ and will have a statutory timeframe prior to the payment of fees and subsequent lodgement.

Where an application is lodged outside of business hours, what are the rules for the start of the application timeline and stop- clock requirements? Assessment timeframes work in business days, so if an application or information is submitted by the applicant outside of business hours, the assessment clock will commence at the start of the next business day.

Will DAP allow changes to the relevant authority during the application process? Yes. Where new information is supplied which then triggers a change in the relevant authority, the PlanSA portal will allow the application to be transmitted or re-allocated to the correct authority. In most circumstances this will result in a fresh application which would follow a new verification process and re-start the assessment timeframes.

Will assessments be undertaken in hard or soft copy file format? The PDI Act supports a digital approach to assessment, with information filed and stored in DAP, accessed via the PlanSA portal. Application assessment should preferably all be undertaken electronically with business processes supported by technology. Paper submission is possible via the local relevant authority and any fees involved will be charged by the local government.

When using the DAP to assess applications, will it be possible to write confidential notes that the public, or an applicant, won’t be able to see? Yes, confidential notes can be made, with certain information being able to be marked as private to an organisation within the DAP. Councils should seek their own advice about the FOI rules applicable to this information. Keep in mind, the public will be able to see the status of each development application, in addition to the details contained within the expanded public register. This will replace the need for councils to establish their own public registers for PDI Act applications.

Will it be possible to change the initial determined assessment pathway during verification? Yes. The relevant authority can reassess the initial assessment pathway determined by the DAP system during verification for each element which sets the appropriate pathway for assessment.

How transparent will information be on the PlanSA portal or within the workflow solution? Can councils add restrictions to certain information? All users will be able to see the status, dates and application details for a development application (with the exception of the application documents and plans). When an extension of time is granted, the applicant will receive notice and any other parties (such as referral agencies) will be able to view any changes to the application. Transparency will be consistent across the platform, but authorities will be able to add confidential notes, where appropriate. These notes may still be subject to FOI processes. Application plans that require public notice are only viewable through the PlanSA portal, and plans will only be published for the duration of the public notification period. When identifying the plans to be notified, the authority must not publish any plans that may jeopardise the present or future security of a building.

Will relevant authorities be able to have multiple requests for additional information if agreed to by the applicant? Yes. Refer to the Guide – Assess a planning and land division consent - ‘Request for Information’ section for this process.

Will certain referral agencies have various timeframes to respond to advice requests? The DAP has been set up to be in line with the Regulations which sets out what timeframe a referral agency has to respond to a referral. This timeframe is shown in the clocks tab of a development application when there is an active referral.

Will an agency’s request for further information be sent directly to the applicant, or does a copy get sent to the relevant authority at the same time to consider? Requests for further information are completed within the DAP and are sent straight to the applicant. The Regulations require the agency to also notify the relevant authority of the request via the PlanSA portal immediately after making the request – this will be visible to the relevant authority via their dashboard in the DAP.

Can the system capture discussions between the agency and the applicant within the system, so that relevant authorities are aware of the deliberations before a referral response is received? Applicants, agencies, relevant authorities and councils will all be able to store correspondence in the DAP. Agencies and applicants will be encouraged to interact via the system. Where this doesn't occur and correspondence is done external to the DAP, agencies will need to then upload correspondence in to the documents store of the development application.

Will the DAP system allow for conditions to be applied to an application? Yes. All development assessment functionality will occur within the DAP. Relevant conditions will continue to be published in a Decision Notification Form (DNF) which are shared on the Public Register for each application that has been granted a decision by a relevant authority. Frequently used or template conditions and advisory notes can be saved by the Organisation Administrator for use by assessors.

Will a ‘deemed consent’ be able to be issued if an application which has been determined to require public notification has not yet undertaken this process? Deemed consent notices can be served for any application for planning consent (except impact assessed by the Minister) that is not decided within the time specified in the Regulations. If public notification is required but has not been completed when a deemed consent notice is served, the council would need to consider applying to the Court to quash the consent.

Where can I find the fee for an extension to a Development authorisation under DIT Legislation? This is within the Planning Development and Infrastructure (Fees, Charges and Contributions) Regulations 2019, and is item 28 under Part 5 of these Regs.

How long will assessments take under the PDI ACT in the DAP? There are different assessment pathways and what is required as part of the application assessment process e.g. referrals, public notification. Please utilise the development assessment timeframes fact sheet available on the PlanSA portal.

Where an applicant emails the application to the council requesting that the relevant authority lodge the application, can the processing fee (hard copy lodgement fee) be charged by the relevant authority? Yes. The fee can still be charged.

The existing planning consent was issued under the old system and now they are unable to bypass the planning consent process in the PlanSA portal to go straight to building rules verification. (for ACP) Please use the Transitional Application Process for Granting Building Rules Consent (Guide available on the PlanSA portal) for when planning consent was previously granted under the Development Act.

There are lot's (virtually every other page) of very good (and up to date as of 2011) photographs of office settings and some floor plans and diagrams. To be more complete I would have liked to have seen more diagrams with dimensional information; you could get some of this from the Metric Handbook, Architects Pocket Book or similar though. Recommended for anyone interested in office space planning and quite reasonably priced compared to some others. I have been quite frustrated by some of the other books on this subject as they all seem a bit out of date - this book definitely reflects leading thinking on workplace design.

Full planning permission is being sought for a 53,000 sq ft office building off Talbot Road in Blackpool town centre, with capacity for more than 1,000 office workers.

The land, on the site of the former Apollo 2000 store, sits within the boundary of the Talbot Gateway development around Blackpool North train station.

Blackpool Council and its development partner Muse are in discussions with an organisation that wishes to develop and occupy a new office within the town centre, they said.

This office would be the fifth phase of the £350m Talbot Gateway development, which is looking to bring more than 8,000 workers and students into Blackpool town centre.

Cllr Mark Smith, cabinet member for levelling up at Blackpool Council, said: “This is another major step forward in our plans to make Blackpool better and boost our local economy. The area around the train station was previously a desolate area in desperate need of regeneration. Over the last ten years we have regenerated it into a desirable location for businesses looking for quality office space on the Fylde coast. Our initial ambition and investment to build the earlier phases of the Talbot Gateway has led us to be in this position where more organisations are approaching us to help them move their jobs into the town centre.

“In turn, that has a huge potential for the private sector to continue to invest in Blackpool, creating more opportunities for business and creating more year-round, well-paid jobs for local people.”

Muse technical director Alan McBride said: “The fifth phase of Talbot Gateway will provide a further catalyst for Blackpool’s renaissance, helping to spur additional economic growth in the town by delivering yet more future-proofed workspace to benefit business in the region.

“Our long-standing partnership with Blackpool Council has already played a pivotal role in the regeneration of the town, and this development would mark yet another notable staging point on the journey towards reframing this iconic seaside destination.”

Phase one, including new offices, a supermarket and an upgraded 650 space multi-storey car park, was completed in 2014. Phase two, a hotel and restaurant, opened on 1st May 2024. A tramway extension, interchange with the train station and surrounding retail units are due to open next month.

Phase three, a £100m government office block for 3,000 civil servants, is under construction by Vinci and expected to open in 2025, while planning consent has been granted for a Multiversity campus for Blackpool and the Fylde College in phase four.

173,Possible relocation of UN headquarters from New York ...,https://tass.com/politics/1502385,,"MOSCOW, September 4. /TASS/. The issue of relocating the UN headquarters from New York to another place is being looked at, since the United States is not implementing its liabilities as a host country, Alexey Drobinin, director of the Russian foreign ministry’s foreign policy planning department, said in an interview with the International Affairs magazine on Sunday.

""It is not an idle matter. It is being discussed indeed. Back then when everyone agreed to headquarter the United Nations in New York, the United States undertook liabilities of a host country and signed a corresponding agreement with the UN Secretariat. Now, we see quite a lot of examples of the United States’ dodging the implementation of this agreement as a host country,"" he said.

""Currently, Russia has problems with obtaining visas for members of the Russian delegation to UN event in New York,"" whereas the United States is obliged to issue such visas without delays and without conditioning visa issuance on any other matters, he explained.

""This liability is not implemented. There are other problems, which are a subject of our dialogue with the UN Secretariat,"" he stressed. ""Such issues are raised and I can confirm that the issue of relocating ‘the UN capital’ is not an idle question.""

According to the Russian diplomat, such problems are facing not only Russia, but other countries the United States doesn’t like due to these or those reasons. ""And the number of such countries is growing and will continue to grow, so our American colleagues will have to decide somehow what is more important for them,"" he added.",plans to relocate headquarters

181,Proposed land swap would put HCSO headquarters in ...,https://www.fox13news.com/news/proposed-land-swap-places-hcso-headquarters-brandon-ybor-citys-gasworx-project-advances,6 июн. 2024 г.,"Hillsborough County leaders are considering a proposed land swap to move the sheriff’s office headquarters to Brandon, giving Gas Worx developer Darryl Shaw an opportunity to expand his Ybor City footprint.

""There’s a potential $100 million savings by moving us now, versus waiting later on, years down the road, to move us,"" Sheriff Chad Chronister said.

Grow Financial is relocating and breaking ground on a new building in Gas Worx in Ybor City this summer.

Under the proposal, the HCSO headquarters would move to Grow Financial’s headquarters in Brandon, which Gas Worx developer Darryl Shaw is under contract to acquire.

Shaw would acquire the HCSO headquarters in Ybor City. This would further grow his development footprint in Ybor City.

RELATED: Gas Worx development brings hope for other Ybor City businesses

""We have got to prepare our sheriff’s department for the next generations,"" Hillsborough County Commissioner Michael Owen said. ""With all the growth we have in Hillsborough County, we need more deputies. Our sheriff’s department has to grow.""

The current Grow Financial Headquarters off the Selmon Expressway is on 24 acres of land, with a five-story building, 140,000 square feet of office space, and a three-story parking garage.

The property is triple the size of the sheriff’s office’s current property of about 8.33 acres.

Grow Financial's Brandon headquarters is triple the size of the current HCSO headquarters in Ybor City.

Chronister says this move would benefit the sheriff’s office and the community in more ways than one.

""We’re in an old building,"" Chronister said. ""There’s a lot of maintenance and upkeep that comes with providing service out of an older building. That aging building is not as safe in terms of hurricane rating. There’s no room to expand as we continue to expand.""

Chronister says this move would also place the sheriff’s office in a more central area of the county.

""The county doesn’t pay taxes,"" Chronister said. ""We’re not paying taxes, and we have a large footprint in Ybor City.""

The proposed swap would also expand opportunities for development in Ybor City.

Pictured: HCSO headquarters in Ybor City.

""Whenever there's a chance to collaborate for the benefit of taxpayers, the sheriff’s office, and Ybor City, we are always going to be interested in those opportunities,"" Shaw explained. ""We are fortunate to have forward-thinking public partners who are open to exploring possibilities that could lead to long-term advantages for the community.""

County leaders say this proposal would be a step-up, not only for the sheriff’s office, but for the future of development in the county.

""As you see the Riverwalk being extended, you can kind of see the future progression of Ybor and Channelside,"" Owen said. ""It’s not my district, but very important to the people of Hillsborough County. So, I think this is just one of those win-wins for everybody.""

Gas Worx rendering

If approved, stakeholders in the project say this could all take about three years to be completed.

Commissioners will consider the proposal on June 20.

If it passes initial approval, Owen says commissioners will then give the required public notice.

Then, he says the proposed land swap may reappear before the commission for another vote in the fall.

183,Prosecutor: ACHD violated open meetings law in HQ ...,https://boisedev.com/news/2024/06/13/achd-open-meetings/,13 часов назад,"The Ada County Prosecutor said the Ada County Highway District violated Idaho’s open meetings law while working to buy a new headquarters building.

In early May, the agency’s board of commissioners voted to spend $16.4 million to purchase an office building on Meeker Ave. in Boise. It plans to move to the former DirecTV call center and open up its current Garden City campus for potential redevelopment, which comes after the highway district reached a settlement in a lawsuit with the City of Garden City over its salt shed and agreed to move its maintenance facility off its current site on the Boise River.

The agency placed notice of the meeting on its agenda roughly 24 hours before the vote, launched a social media video, and issued a news release moments later.

Idaho State Code requires agencies to provide a full list of all the items to be discussed by public officials at least 48 hours in advance of the meeting. Agendas can be updated, but only if “a good faith effort is made to include, in the original agenda notice, all items known to be probable items of discussion.”

ACHD claimed it did not put the headquarters sale on its initial agenda because leaders wanted “to tell our staff in person at our monthly all-staff meeting (which happened yesterday AM) before adding it to the agenda. We felt they deserved to find out in person from leadership rather than reading it in an agenda or on a news site.”

Now the agency is giving a different reason.

Prosecutor investigates

Idaho’s open meetings laws are enforced by the prosecutor’s office for each county. BoiseDev asked the Ada County Prosecutor if it was aware of the issue, and after our inquiry, the prosecutor launched an investigation.

“While there were some contextual issues which factored into the agency’s decision to wait to post the item on their agenda until 1 day before the meeting, those surrounding issues are not sufficient to relieve the agency of the duty to timely post their agenda,” Ada County Prosecutor Chief Criminal Deputy Shawna Dunn wrote in a letter to BoiseDev.

After the prosecutor’s investigation, ACHD placed the headquarters back on its agenda for its May 22nd meeting. It properly disclosed the item 48 hours before the meeting.

During that meeting, ACHD General Counsel Steve Price gave a different reason than the one ACHD claimed on social media.

He noted that the property owner had a $1-billion lien on the property it was working to clear.

“It took a lot of effort to get the lien removed, and it was finally removed around 12 o’clock on April 30th,” Price said. “We were hoping to have the closing and commission meeting coincide.”

Another vote

He noted that the agency didn’t state the reason when it amended the agenda and called it “something that was overlooked by all the chaos” in trying to get the deal closed. Price said in the meeting that reposting and revoting on the was the correct move to cure the open meetings violation.

“The violation is cured by us recognizing that the commission’s decision on May 1 is now void, and we need to deliberate and make a decision in a valid public meeting,” Price said.

The commission didn’t discuss the matter further, and unanimously voted to re-approve the sale.

Dunn, in her letter to BoiseDev, agreed with Price’s conclusion and said that the second vote cured the violation of state code.",plans to relocate headquarters
146,Proxy Properties Plans Next Adaptive Reuse at Dallas ...,https://therealdeal.com/texas/dallas/2024/06/12/proxy-properties-plans-next-adaptive-reuse-at-dallas-church/,2 дня назад,"Proxy Properties, a local developer with a history of adaptive reuse projects in Oak Cliff, is plotting its next project that will put its creativity to the test.

The firm is exploring a range of redevelopment possibilities for the 45,000-square-foot Oak Cliff United Methodist Church, at 549 East Jefferson Boulevard, the Dallas Morning News reported.

While specific plans for the church have yet to be established, Proxy envisions a blend of retail, office and residential spaces. It is working to rezone the protected historic landmark to allow a mix of uses.

“Our goal is to create something special that people can walk around and is open to the public,” Proxy owner A.J. Ramler told the outlet.

Despite a struggling office market that’s been plagued by remote-work trends, Ramler sees potential in offering creative, affordable office spaces. The residential portion, if included, would comprise a maximum of 35 to 40 units.

The church, built in 1915, closed in 2015 due to unsustainable repair costs and a small congregation. It narrowly avoided demolition three years ago due to its deteriorating condition, exacerbated by an interior fire.

Sign Up for the undefined Newsletter SIGN UP

Proxy successfully registered two of the three buildings on the property as national historic places and later secured over 50 percent of construction costs from state and national registers, the outlet reported. The firm plans to seek tax credits for the extensive historical renovations required.

Restoration efforts will preserve features such as stained glass windows and the sanctuary’s verticality and openness.

“There are a lot of limitations on what you’re able to do because of the historic designation, which is a good thing, because it’s also what maintains the interesting aspects of these older buildings,” Ramler said.

Community feedback has played a role in shaping the project. Initial opposition from six neighbors led to productive discussions, with residents expressing a preference for a development that mirrors Proxy’s Oak Cliff Assembly project, which turned another historic church into an event center with retail and office uses.

Proxy is working to transform a trio of dilapidated buildings at 900 East Clarendon Drive into a mixed-use hub catering to retail and industrial tenants.

Honasa Consumer Pvt. Ltd. (HCPL), the parent company of Mamaearth, and The Derma Co., and the fastest-growing house of brands for personal care, launched a new skincare brand – Ayuga, a brand crafted with the perfect balance of traditional, authentic, and honest ayurvedic recipes and face yoga rituals for modern millennial skincare. The brand has collaborated with yoga and wellness ambassador, Shilpa Shetty Kundra, to craft the brand ideology.

India’s rich cultural heritage especially around wellness and spirituality is not hidden from the world. Two of our Vedas have given life to sciences which are now seeing more than ever relevance and are being adopted globally. Rigveda gave birth to Yoga and Atharva Veda to Ayurveda, both of these being represented as a way of life than just processes or products.

Our culture has always believed that a balanced life is a key to satisfaction and happiness. Millennials lately have been experiencing a hectic imbalanced lifestyle that eventually takes a toll on their physical and mental health. Hence, it is imperative to prioritize and focus on what is important in their lives and restore balance as otherwise, it starts reflecting on one’s external features, too, like skin discoloration, hair fall, early aging, and more.

Ayugawas founded to restore balance in the lives of millennials through recipes and rituals. With the deep knowledge of 5,000 years of Ayurveda and yoga to solve these concerns and provide a new sense of balance to the world. The product has been crafted to ensure a perfect balance of our trusted, authentic, and honest Ayurvedic recipes and Face Yoga rituals to take care of skin and hair concerns, in collaboration with the help of India’s best Ayurveda and Face Yoga experts. The brand has launched its first skincare range with Kumkumadi – an authentic formulation taken from the text of ‘Astanga Hridyam’ and has reimagined it in modern skincare formats for millennials.

The brand partnered with the wellness icon of India, Shilpa Shetty Kundra, to propagate the brand ideology of 'restoring balance in life with rituals and recipes'. She is not only an icon but has made yoga synonymous with holistic wellness. She believes that yoga, not only, has helped her stay fit but has also helped her restore the balance between her inner and outer self. She has been strongly advocating making yoga a way of life.

Varun Alagh, Co-founder and CEO said, “Honasa Consumer was founded with the vision of building a ‘House of Brands’ that identify and solve millennials concerns with a digital-first approach. We actively research trends, understand consumer sentiments, and create brands that serve our consumers best. For the last 2 years, we have been trying to understand the mystery of why Ayurveda has not been able to capture the fancy of Millennials the way Yoga has.

That’s when we envisioned Ayuga which will bring the best of both worlds. At Ayuga we believe millennials need to discover these amazing effective sciences in a manner that makes them relevant. Crafted on the philosophy of restoring balance to life, we have collaborated with Shilpa Shetty Kundra as she redefined yoga and wellness in India, and inspired millions of people to make yoga a way of their life. With a unique and innovative brand and product proposition and expertise in direct-to-consumer and crafting playbooks for launching and scaling brands, we are confident that our consumers will find relevance and connect with the brand.”

Ghazal Alagh, Co-founder and Chief Innovation Officer, “Honasa Consumer Pvt. Ltd., said, “We are an organization built on strong consumer centricity and direct-to-consumer format. We are constantly speaking to consumers to get real-time feedback and information on their requirements and the kind of solutions they want. Hence, we constantly research millennials’ concerns to create brands and products that serve them.”

61,Return to On-Site Work | Office of the President,https://president.utexas.edu/2024-messages-speeches/return-site-work,,"Dear UT community,

Beginning this fall semester, the University will require almost all staff members to work on site full time. This will be a significant change for some members of our community, so it is important to take a step back and explain why requiring in-person work best supports our culture and reinforces the teaching and research mission of our University.

Staff members can most effectively serve our students, faculty, fellow staff members, and other stakeholders when working together in an environment that fosters collaboration, innovation, availability, and reliability. Our vibrant campus community helps distinguish our great University, and as members of our staff, you contribute to that vibrancy each day. We are here because of our students, and your consistent presence will help provide a more complete and engaging learning experience for students throughout campus.

Leaders of colleges, schools, and units will work through the logistics of these changes and, by early July, will finalize their plans to bring most staff members back to on-site work full time. All plans will be fully implemented by Aug. 19, which is one week before the start of fall classes. Based on the revised guidelines, a small number of roles will continue to be eligible for remote or hybrid work at the discretion of the supervisor and college, school, or unit leader. These roles will be characterized by observable productivity; work that is transactional, internal, or service related; or functions that require high levels of individual time to perform.

For all staff members, some occasions may call for irregular schedules or intermittent remote work that does not require formal arrangements. Managers will continue to make those decisions on an as-needed basis.

Thank you for your work and your profound dedication to our Longhorn community. I look forward to having students, faculty, and staff together on the Forty Acres as we continue to make this the world’s highest-impact public research university.

Sincerely yours,

Jay Hartzell

422,Revisiting Rock Paper Scissors,https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-revisiting-rock-paper-scissors,,"Introduction Now that we can manipulate the DOM, it’s time to revisit Rock Paper Scissors and add a UI to it. Before you start making changes to your Rock Paper Scissors project, you need to learn about a concept in Git called branching so that you can make your changes without having to worry about breaking what you have now. Branches in Git allow your repository to hold multiple alternate reality versions of your files at the same time. You’ve actually (sort of) been using branches since you made your first commit, you just might not have known it! Back in the setting up Git lesson when you ran git config --global init.defaultBranch main you were setting the name of what’s called the default branch for your repos. The default branch is just what we call the branch that is created when you make your first commit on a project, and in that command we set the name to be main as is the current standard. Like the branches in a tree (hence the name), all of the branches for a project stem off of a “trunk” (the main branch) or off of other branches. When you make commits on a specific branch, those changes only exist on that branch, leaving all of your other branches exactly as they were when you branched off of them. This means that you can keep your main branch as a place for only finished features that you know are working properly, and add each feature to your project using dedicated branches which we call feature branches.

Lesson overview This section contains a general overview of topics that you will learn in this lesson. How to create a new branch.

How to merge branches.

Best practices and use cases of branches.

Using branches You can make new branches by using the command git branch <branch_name> . You can then change to your new branch using git checkout <branch_name> . You can also create a new branch and change to it in a single command by using the -b flag with checkout , in the form git checkout -b <branch_name> . You can see all of your current branches using git branch with no other arguments. The branch that you’re currently on will be indicated with an asterisk. If you want to change back to main from any other branch, you can do so just like changing to any other branch using git checkout main . Once you are done working on your feature branch and are ready to bring the commits that you’ve made on it to your main branch, you will need to perform what is known as a merge . Merges are done by using the command git merge <branch_name> which will take the changes you’ve committed in branch_name and add them to the branch that you’re currently on. You can see an example of a develop branch being created, committed to, and then merged to main in the diagram below. --- title: Example of Git Branching --- gitGraph commit id: ""commit1"" commit id: ""commit2"" branch develop checkout develop commit id: ""commit1a"" commit id: ""commit2a"" checkout main merge develop id: ""merge to main"" Sometimes, the same lines in a file will have been changed by two different branches. When this happens, you will have a merge conflict when you try and merge those branches together. In order to finish merging the branches you will have to first resolve the conflict, which will be covered in a future lesson. When you don’t need a branch anymore, it can be deleted using git branch -d <branch_name> if the branch has already been merged into main , or with git branch -D <branch_name> if it hasn’t. You will usually want to delete branches when you’re done with them, otherwise they can pile up and make it more difficult to find the branch you’re looking for when you need it.

Sharing code Another great use case for branches is to share code with others that you might not want to commit to your main branch (or feature branch) at all. For example: if you have a bug in a new feature you’re working on that you can’t figure out, and it causes your code to break, you don’t want to commit that broken code and have it in your project’s “permanent record”. You could instead create a new temporary branch, switch to it and commit your code to this new branch. If you then push this new temporary branch to GitHub you can share it with others that may be able to help solve your problem. In the assignment below you will get some hands-on practice on making new branches.

Assignment Set up a new branch on your previous Rock Paper Scissors repo Since we’ll be making a UI for our Rock Paper Scissors game, make a new branch and change to it with the command git checkout -b rps-ui . You are now working in the rps-ui branch, locally. However, this branch does not exist in your remote repo yet. If you go to your github repo page, you’ll see that you only have 1 branch, which would be main . Let’s push this new branch to your remote repo with the command git push origin rps-ui . Now, you’ll see two branches in your GitHub repository! You can select the new branch on GitHub using the dropdown branch selector shown in the screenshot below. Make sure you are on the rps-ui branch. You can check this, with the git branch command. The branch you are currently on will have an (*)asterisk next to it. If you’re in another branch for some reason, change to rps-ui with the command git checkout rps-ui . Now you’re all set to work on your new feature! Note: You can add files, commit to this branch, and push changes to your repo, just like you would with the main branch. Everything is the same except when you push the changes, you’d use git push origin rps-ui instead of git push origin main , since we’re pushing to our new branch. In our UI, the player should be able to play the game by clicking on buttons rather than typing their answer in a prompt. For now, remove the logic that plays exactly five rounds. Create three buttons, one for each selection. Add an event listener to the buttons that call your playRound function with the correct playerSelection every time a button is clicked. (you can keep the console.log s for this step) Add a div for displaying results and change all of your console.log s into DOM methods. Display the running score, and announce a winner of the game once one player reaches 5 points. You will likely have to refactor (rework/rewrite) your original code to make it work for this. That’s OK! Reworking old code is an important part of a programmer’s life. Once you’re all done with your UI and made sure everything’s satisfactory, ensure all of your changes are committed to the rps-ui branch with git status before continuing. Now let’s take a look at how we can merge the changes from our rps-ui branch back to our main branch. Checkout the branch we want to merge INTO i.e. main with the command git checkout main . Now let’s merge our rps-ui branch into main , our current branch, with git merge rps-ui . If everything goes fine, our rps-ui branch is now successfully merged with main! Use git log and you’ll see all the commits you’ve made to your feature branch on top of the commits you made to the main branch. Now for our final step! Let’s push our main branch into our remote repo by running git push origin main . Go to your GitHub repo and you’ll see that our main branch will have all the changes and commits you made to the rps-ui branch. Congratulations! You’ve successfully pushed your first feature into your production branch! Now that we have all our code in the main branch, we don’t really need our rps-ui branch anymore. Let’s do some cleanup, both locally and in the remote repo. Delete the branch from our local repo with git branch -d rps-ui and also delete it from the remote repo on GitHub with git push origin --delete rps-ui . Congrats, we’re all done with our cleanup! Make sure to publish the project on GitHub Pages and add a live preview link in the project lesson.",planning to open new branch
177,Revolut moves global HQ to heart of London's financial ...,https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/national-international/revolut-moves-global-hq-to-heart-of-londons-financial-district-as-it-awaits-uk-bank-license/3312550/,1 день назад,"Revolut has purchased a 10-year lease for a new global headquarters in the YY London building in the center of Canary Wharf.

The move will see Revolut increase its office footprint by 40% to 113,000 square feet, taking up four floors of space in the office.

The announcement comes as Revolut continues to wait to find out whether its bid for a banking license in the U.K. is successful.

British financial technology firm Revolut announced Thursday that it's planning to move its official headquarters in London to Canary Wharf, the city's major financial district.

Revolut will relocate its global headquarters to the YY London building in the center of Canary Wharf. The company has agreed a 10-year lease for the building.

As a result, Revolut will increase its office footprint by 40% to 113,000 square feet and take up four floors.

It plans to display its logo on two signs on the sides of the new building – mimicking the trend of legacy bank brands, such as HSBC, Barclays, and Citigroup. Revolut said the signs remain subject to planning permission.

HSBC recently announced it would move its world headquarters from its 45-storey Canary Wharf tower by 2027 when its current lease expires.

That came after the firm said it would reduce office space by nearly 40% globally to cut costs and respond to the trend of hybrid working.

Canary Wharf is London's main financial district, home to many of the world's largest banks, insurers, and other financial institutions.

Revolut's announcement comes as the digital banking startup is still waiting to hear on the success of its bid for a banking license in the U.K., which would enable it to launch lending products such as credit cards and personal loans.

The company has been awaiting a green light from city regulators including the Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority since 2021.

Revolut said that its decision to open a new global headquarters at the heart of the city demonstrates that the firm remains committed to the U.K. market.

""This new head office strengthens our commitment to the UK, our home country, whilst also establishing the foundation to support future growth,"" Francesca Carlesi, CEO of Revolut's U.K. business, said in a press statement.

Revolut's co-founders Nikolay Storonsky and Vlad Yatsenko — the company's global CEO and chief technology officer, respectively — had previously criticized the U.K. for having a regulatory environment they characterized as too bureaucratic.

The company previously committed to growing its global workforce by 40% in 2024. Revolut said that it now has over 9 million customers in the U.K.

New ways of using office space

The news comes as employers debate ways of convincing their employees back into the office, following the widespread shift to remote work triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic.

Revolut has said it will stand by its remote-first approach, which means that its employees can work from home, but are encouraged to come into the office for valuable in-person interactions.",plans to relocate headquarters
395,Rockefeller Center,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockefeller_Center,,"Skyscraper complex in Manhattan, New York

United States historic place

Rockefeller Center is a complex of 19 commercial buildings covering 22 acres (89,000 m2) between 48th Street and 51st Street in the Midtown Manhattan neighborhood of New York City. The 14 original Art Deco buildings, commissioned by the Rockefeller family, span the area between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue, split by a large sunken square and a private street called Rockefeller Plaza. Later additions include 75 Rockefeller Plaza across 51st Street at the north end of Rockefeller Plaza, and four International Style buildings on the west side of Sixth Avenue.

In 1928, Columbia University, the owner of the site, leased the land to John D. Rockefeller Jr., who was the main person behind the complex's construction. Originally envisioned as the site for a new Metropolitan Opera building, the current Rockefeller Center came about after the Met could not afford to move to the proposed new building. Various plans were discussed before the current one was approved in 1932. Construction of Rockefeller Center started in 1931, and the first buildings opened in 1933. The core of the complex was completed by 1939. Described as one of the greatest projects of the Great Depression era, Rockefeller Center became a New York City designated landmark in 1985 and a National Historic Landmark in 1987. The complex and associated land has been controlled since 2000 by Tishman Speyer, which bought the property for $1.85 billion.

The original center has several sections. Radio City, along Sixth Avenue and centered on 30 Rockefeller Plaza, includes Radio City Music Hall and was built for RCA's radio-related enterprises such as NBC. The International Complex along Fifth Avenue was built to house foreign-based tenants. The remainder of the original complex originally hosted printed media as well as Eastern Air Lines. While 600 Fifth Avenue is at the southeast corner of the complex, it was built by private interests in the 1950s and was only acquired by the center in 1963. The complex is noted for the large quantities of art present in almost all of its buildings, its expansive underground concourse, its ice-skating rink, and its annual lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree.

History [ edit ]

For more details on construction, see Construction of Rockefeller Center

Context [ edit ]

The first private owner of the site was physician David Hosack, who purchased twenty acres of rural land from New York City in 1801 and opened the country's first botanical garden, the Elgin Botanic Garden, on the site.[8][9] The gardens operated until 1811, and by 1823 the property was under the ownership of Columbia University. Columbia moved its main campus north to Morningside Heights, in Upper Manhattan, by the turn of the century.

Rockefeller Center originated as a plan to replace the old Metropolitan Opera House (pictured).

In 1926, the Metropolitan Opera started looking for locations for a new opera house to replace the existing building at 39th Street and Broadway. By 1928, Benjamin Wistar Morris and designer Joseph Urban were hired to come up with blueprints for the house. However, the new building was too expensive for the Met to fund by itself, and John D. Rockefeller Jr. eventually gave his support to the project (John D. Rockefeller Sr., his father, was not involved). Rockefeller hired Todd, Robertson and Todd as design consultants to determine its viability. John R. Todd then put forth a plan for the Met.[21] Columbia leased the plot to Rockefeller for 87 years at a cost of $3 million per year,[21] excluding some properties on Fifth Avenue and a strip on Sixth Avenue.[9][23] The initial cost of acquiring the space, razing some of the existing buildings, and constructing new buildings was estimated at $250 million.

Rockefeller hired Corbett, Harrison & MacMurray; Hood, Godley & Fouilhoux; and Reinhard & Hofmeister, to design the buildings. They worked under the umbrella of ""Associated Architects"" so none of the buildings could be attributed to any specific firm. The principal builder and ""managing agent"" was John R. Todd, one of the co-founders of Todd, Robertson and Todd. The principal architect and leader of the Associated Architects was Raymond Hood, a student of the Art Deco architectural movement.[6] The other architects included Harvey Wiley Corbett and Wallace Harrison.[26] L. Andrew Reinhard and Henry Hofmeister had been hired by John Todd as the ""rental architects"", who designed the floor plans for the complex. The Metropolitan Square Corporation (the precursor to Rockefeller Center Inc.) was formed in December 1928 to oversee construction.

After the stock market crash of 1929, the Metropolitan Opera could not afford to move anymore. After the opera plans were canceled on December 6, 1929,[21] Rockefeller quickly negotiated with Radio Corporation of America (RCA) and its subsidiaries, National Broadcasting Company (NBC) and Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO), to build a mass media entertainment complex on the site. By May 1930, RCA and its affiliates had agreed to develop the site. Todd released a new plan ""G-3"" in January 1930, followed by an ""H plan"" that March. Another plan, announced in March 1931, received mostly negative feedback from the public. The design of the complex was affected greatly by the 1916 Zoning Resolution, which required setbacks to all high street-side exterior walls of New York City buildings in order to increase sunlight for city streets.[b] The plan also included rooftop gardens[45][46] and a recessed central plaza.[48][45] The International Complex, announced in 1931, replaced an earlier plan for an oval retail building; its name was derived by the British, French, and Italian tenants who eventually occupied it.

During early planning, the development was often referred to as ""Radio City"", ""Rockefeller City"", or ""Metropolitan Square"" (after the Metropolitan Square Corporation).[55] Ivy Lee, the Rockefeller family's publicity adviser, suggested changing the name to ""Rockefeller Center"". John Rockefeller Jr. initially did not want the Rockefeller family name associated with the commercial project, but was persuaded on the grounds that the name would attract far more tenants. The name was formally changed in December 1931.[55] Over time, the appellation of ""Radio City"" devolved from describing the entire complex to just the complex's western section, and by 1937, only the Radio City Music Hall contained the ""Radio City"" name.[57]

Construction [ edit ]

For the project, 228 buildings on the site were razed and some 4,000 tenants relocated. Demolition of the properties began in 1930. All of the buildings' leases had been bought by August 1931,[60] though there were some tenants on the western and southeastern edges of the plot who refused to leave their property, and Rockefeller Center was built around these buildings. Excavation of the Sixth Avenue side of the complex began in July 1931,[63] and construction on the first buildings, Radio City Music Hall and the Center Theatre, began later that year.[65] Fourteen million cubic feet (400,000 m3) of Indiana Limestone were ordered for the project in December 1931, the largest such order at the time.[66]

Construction progress in December 1933

The RKO Building was the first structure to be completed, in September 1932,[67] followed by the Music Hall in December 1932[68][69] and the British Empire Building in April 1933. The RCA Building's opening was delayed from May 1 to mid-May because of a controversy over Man at the Crossroads, a painting in the building's lobby, which was later covered up and removed. A new street through the complex, Rockefeller Plaza, was constructed in stages between 1933[72] and 1937.[73] The complex's famed Christmas tree in the center of the plaza was erected for the first time in December 1933,[74] and the complex's Prometheus statue was constructed in May 1934.[75] By July 1934, the complex had leased 80% of the available space in the six buildings that were already opened.[77]

The iconic photograph Lunch atop a Skyscraper depicts workers resting for a meal during the construction of 30 Rockefeller Plaza.

Work on two more internationally themed retail buildings and a larger, 38-story, 512-foot (156 m) ""International Building"", started in September 1934. One of the two small buildings was already rented to Italian interests.[78] The final small building would have been rented by Germany, but Rockefeller ruled this out in 1934 after noticing National Socialist extremism from the country's government. The empty office site was downsized and became the ""International Building North"", rented by various international tenants. In April 1935, developers opened the International Building and its wings.[83][84]

The underground pedestrian mall and ramp system between 48th and 51st streets was finished in early May.[85] In 1936, an ice skating rink replaced the unprofitable retail space on the lower plaza, below ground level.[88][89]

The 36-story Time & Life Building,[c] named for anchor tenant Time Inc.,[93] was completed in November 1936,[94] replacing an empty plot on the southern block that had been used for vehicle parking. Eleven buildings had been completed by 1937 at a total cost of over $100 million.[97] A building for Associated Press on the northern block's empty lot, which had been reserved for the Metropolitan Opera house,[99] was topped out by June 1938[100] and occupied by December of that year.[101] The presence of Associated Press and Time Inc. expanded Rockefeller Center's scope from strictly a radio-communications complex to a hub of both radio and print media. The Guild, a newsreel theater, opened in 1938 along the curve of the truck ramp below the Associated Press Building.[103] After Nelson Rockefeller became president of Rockefeller Center in 1938, he fired John Todd as the complex's manager and appointed Hugh Robertson in his place. The Rockefeller family started occupying the 56th floor of the RCA Building,[106] though the offices would later expand to the 54th and 55th floors as well.

1230 Avenue of the Americas (originally the U.S. Rubber Company Building) is the most recently built structure in the original complex.

A proposed 16-story building in the center of the southernmost block was leased to Eastern Air Lines in June 1940.[109] Excavation started in October 1938, and the building was topped out by April 1939.[110] At the same time, Rockefeller Center Inc. wanted to develop the western half of the southern plot, which was partially occupied by the Center Theatre. The United States Rubber Company agreed to occupy the plot. and excavation of the U.S. Rubber Company Building site commenced in May 1939.[114] John Rockefeller installed the building's ceremonial final rivet on November 1, 1939, marking the completion of the original complex.[115] However, although the final rivet had been driven, the Eastern Air Lines Building was not completed until October 1940.[117]

The construction of the project employed between 40,000 and 60,000 people. The complex was the largest private building project ever undertaken in contemporary times.[119] Architectural historian Carol Herselle Krinsky describes the center as ""the only large private permanent construction project planned and executed between the start of the Depression and the end of the Second World War"". According to writer Daniel Okrent, Rockefeller Center was so extensive that it was said that ""you could do anything you wanted except sleep (no hotels), pray (no churches), or not pay rent to [John Rockefeller Jr.]"". By fall 1939, the complex had 26,000 tenants and 125,000 daily visitors. That year, 1.3 million people went on a guided tour of Rockefeller Center or visited the RCA Building's observation deck, while 6 million people visited the underground shopping mall, and 7 million saw a performance at Rockefeller Center.

World War II era [ edit ]

Even before the U.S. officially entered World War II in 1941, Rockefeller Center was affected by the war. The Dutch government had been slated to take up one-fifth of the space at 10 Rockefeller Plaza, but could not do so because of World War II. Seven of the complex's eight travel agencies had to move elsewhere because of the war, and William Rhodes Davis, a tenant who shipped oil to Nazi Germany and fascist Italy, was denied a lease renewal in 1941. After the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Rockefeller Center Inc. terminated all lease agreements with German, Italian, and Japanese tenants because their respective countries comprised the Axis powers, whom the United States were fighting against. Art on Palazzo d'Italia was taken down because they were seen as being fascist, and the Rainbow Room was closed to the public from 1943 to 1950. Instructions for blackouts and sandbags for extinguishing fires were placed throughout the complex. During the war, the RCA Building's Room 3603 became the primary location of the U.S. operations of British Intelligence's British Security Co-ordination, organized by William Stephenson. It also served as the office of Allen Dulles, who would later head the Central Intelligence Agency.[128]

Rockefeller Center only became profitable after the last building in the original complex was completed. The complex had incurred $26 million in debt by 1935, which had increased to $39 million by 1940. However, the complex was already 87% rented by 1940, and by the next year, Rockefeller Center was nearly fully rented, making a profit for the first time in its history. By 1944, the complex's existing rentable area totaled 5,290,000 square feet (491,000 m2), with 99.7% of the space being leased.[130] Because the complex was almost completely rented, Rockefeller Center's managers kept waiting lists of potential tenants, and as a result of the waiting lists, the complex's office space became more desirable to these tenants. Two years later, there were 400 companies who wanted to rent space in Rockefeller Center, and the complex's managers determined that they would need to add 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of space in order to house all the prospective tenants. Rockefeller Center was also popular among visitors: for instance, the lines to enter one of the Music Hall's five daily shows stretched from Sixth Avenue and 50th Street to Fifth Avenue and 52nd Street, a distance of four blocks.

In light of the abundance of possible renters, John Rockefeller Jr. transferred his ownership of the complex to his sons. The father collected the $57.5 million loan that Rockefeller Center Inc. owed him, then distributed it to his sons in the form of a tax break. Rockefeller Center eventually became the family's ""single largest repository"" of wealth. In 1950, Rockefeller Center Inc. paid the last installment of the $65 million mortgage owed to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Three years later, the complex was making $5 million per year in profit, excluding the tax breaks.

Post-World War II expansion [ edit ]

Rockefeller Center Inc. had started working on plans to expand the complex during World War II, even though the outbreak of the war had stopped almost all civilian construction projects. In 1943, the complex's managers bought land and buildings on three street corners near the complex.[137] Rockefeller Center unveiled plans for expansion to the southwest and north in 1944.[130]

Esso (now Exxon) was one of the tenants who wanted to expand, and the company signaled that it would build its own office tower if Rockefeller Center's managers did not construct a building for them. They were given land at the north end of Rockefeller Plaza. In February 1947, the under-construction Esso Building, at the north end of the existing property, became part of Rockefeller Center after ownership of the building was transferred from the Haswin Corporation to Rockefeller Center, Inc.[139] The building was topped out the next month.[140] Hugh Robertson stepped down as manager the next year, and he was replaced by Gustav Eyssell.

Some tenants, such as the Sinclair Oil Corporation, indicated that they wanted to leave the complex after their leases expired in 1962–1963 because the original complex's buildings did not have air conditioning, while newer office buildings did. As Columbia University still owned the land underneath the complex, they were tasked with installing air conditioning in the buildings. The new building would add emphasis to any north–south views of the center, since the existing complex's building only formed west–east axes. Another problem befell Rockefeller Center's key tenants, NBC and RCA, who were approached by other developers with the promise of more leasable space, a commodity that was scarce in the fully leased complex. These problems were pushed aside temporarily by the onset of the Korean War in 1950. By 1951, Columbia had acquiesced to reimbursing Rockefeller Center, Inc., for AC installation, while NBC and RCA were given permission to use the Center Theatre for extra broadcasting space.

In 1949, in the face of a shrinking congregation, the St. Nicholas Church leased the church building to the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, who then leased three contiguous plots from Rockefeller Center for a proposed 28-story building. The congregation was dispersed to other churches, and the old church building at Fifth Avenue and 48th Street was subsequently demolished.[147] Construction commenced on 600 Fifth Avenue in 1950, and the tower was completed by 1952. The building was named after the Sinclair Oil Company, who leased eight floors.[148] As a result of Sinclair's relocation to 600 Fifth Avenue, as well as Esso's relocation to 75 Rockefeller Plaza, NBC and RCA could expand into the space that Sinclair and Esso formerly occupied in the original complex, and they moved out of the Center Theatre shortly after the Sinclair Oil Company moved into its own tower. In mid-1953, Columbia bought all of the land along Sixth Avenue that had been owned by the Underel Corporation at a cost of $5.5 million. Rockefeller Center leased the land back from Columbia until 1973 for $200,000 a year.[150][151] This allowed Columbia to install air conditioning, passing the costs on to the remaining tenants in return for lease extensions.

The small Center Theatre was deemed redundant to the Radio City Music Hall, and in its final years, had been used as an NBC and RCA broadcasting space. After NBC and RCA expanded into the floor area formerly occupied by Sinclair, the U.S. Rubber Company indicated that it wanted to expand its office building into the space that was taken up by the underused theater. In October 1953, it was announced that the theater would be demolished.[152] It was demolished in 1954.[153]

Time-Life also wanted to expand, as its existing space in 1 Rockefeller Plaza was also becoming insufficient.[154] In August 1953, Rockefeller Center, Inc., bought a tract of land on the west side of Sixth Avenue between 50th and 51st streets.[154] In 1956, two years after the demolition of the Center Theatre, officials announced the construction of a new tower, the Time-Life Building, on that plot. The 500-foot (150 m), $7 million building would include connections to the existing passageway system and to Roxy's Theater directly to its west.[155] Time Inc. and Rockefeller Center formed a joint venture, Rock-Time Inc., which would share the tower's rent income between Time Inc. and Rockefeller Center. Construction on the Time-Life Building's steelwork started in April 1958,[156] and the structure topped out in November of that year.[157] The building officially opened in December 1959.[92]

Around 1960, Rockefeller Center, Uris Buildings Corporation, and Webb and Knapp formed another joint venture, Rock-Uris Corp. Originally, the venture wanted to construct a hotel to the west of 75 Rockefeller Center, but ultimately, a glass-and-concrete 43-story office building was built on the site. In 1961, the building was named after Sperry Corporation, who leased eight floors in the future building.[159] The hotel, New York Hilton at Rockefeller Center, was built two blocks north in 1963.[160]

600 Fifth Avenue was sold to Rockefeller Center's managers in 1963, thus officially becoming part of Rockefeller Center.[161] The same year, officials from Esso (later renamed Exxon) proposed a new building for the complex because the company had outgrown the space in the buildings it already occupied.[162] Rockefeller Center's managers hired the architectural firm Harrison & Abramovitz to design three new towers on the west side of Sixth Avenue, with one tower on each block between 47th and 50th streets. The Exxon Building, at 1251 Avenue of the Americas between 49th and 50th streets, was formally announced in August 1967.[164] Three months later, officials also announced plans for a tower housing McGraw-Hill, located one block south at 1221 Avenue of the Americas.[165] Plans for a tower anchored by Celanese, to be located at 1211 Avenue of the Americas between 47th and 48th streets, would not be revealed until 1970.[166] The Exxon Building opened in 1971, followed by the McGraw-Hill Building in 1973 and the Celanese Building in 1974. By the time all three of the new buildings were opened, Rockefeller Center contained 7% of Manhattan's 250,000,000 square feet (23,000,000 m2) of leasable office space.[168]

1970s and 1980s [ edit ]

Rockefeller Center's landmark plaque

600 Fifth Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza received renovations in the early 1970s. Unlike in the rest of the complex, where different components were renovated one at a time to avoid disturbing tenants, the two structures were renovated all at once because their space was largely vacant.[169] Rockefeller Center Inc. renewed their lease on the complex in 1973.[170]

Through the 1960s, the Music Hall was successful regardless of the status of the city's economic, business, or entertainment sectors as a whole. However, by the early 1970s, the proliferation of closed-captioned foreign movies had reduced attendance at the Music Hall. The first round of staff and performer firings began in 1972. By January 1978, the Music Hall was in debt,[171][172] and the hall's annual attendance had declined to 1.5 million visitors, down from 5 million in 1968.[174] Officials stated that it could not remain open after April.[171] A grassroots campaign formed the Showpeople's Committee to Save Radio City Music Hall.[175] After several weeks of lobbying, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) designated the theater as an interior city landmark in March,[176] followed by a National Register of Historic Places listing in May.[177] The hall was set to close on April 12,[178] but five days before the planned closing date, the Empire State Development Corporation voted to create a nonprofit subsidiary to lease the Music Hall.[179]

A New York Times report in 1982 stated that Rockefeller Center had been popular among tenants from its inception, being almost fully rented for much of the first half-century of its existence.[180] The major exception was in the 1970s, when it was only 85 percent rented.[180][181] However, Rockefeller Center was not popular as an entertainment complex, having been used for mainly commercial purposes through its history.[180] The LPC held hearings in 1983 to determine how much of Rockefeller Center should be protected as a landmark.[182] The Rockefeller family and Columbia University acknowledged that the buildings were already symbolically landmarks, but their spokesman John E. Zuccotti recommended that only a small section (including the RCA Building, Lower Plaza, and Channel Gardens) should be protected. By contrast, almost everyone else who supported Rockefeller Center's landmark status recommended that the entire complex be landmarked.[183][184][181] The LPC granted landmark status to the exteriors of all of the original complex's buildings, as well as the interiors of the International Building's and 30 Rockefeller Plaza's lobbies, on April 23, 1985.[181] In its approval of the complex's landmark status, the commission wrote, ""Rockefeller Center ranks among the grandest architectural projects ever undertaken in the United States"". The buildings became a National Historic Landmark two years later.[6][188][189] The United States Department of the Interior wrote in its report that the center was ""one of the most successful urban planning projects in the history of American architecture"".

Columbia University was not making enough money from Rockefeller Center leases by the 1970s, since a series of negotiations with Rockefeller Center Inc. (now Rockefeller Group) had effectively reduced the annual lease payment to $11 million. The university's funds had dwindled so much that by 1972, their expenses were paid for by their endowment fund. In 1983, Columbia University started looking to sell the land beneath Rockefeller Center.[192] Two years later, Columbia agreed to sell the land to the Rockefeller Group for $400 million.[192] The Rockefeller Group immediately set out to modernize many aspects of the complex. The Rainbow Room was closed for a $20 million restoration and expansion that brought the restaurant's floor area to 4,500 square feet (420 m2),[194] and it reopened in December 1987.[195] The RCA Building's observation deck was subsequently closed because the Rainbow Room's expansion eliminated the only passageway to the observatory's elevator bank.[196] In mid-1988, the RCA Building was renamed the GE Building.[197][198] Mitsubishi Estate, a real estate company of the Mitsubishi Group, purchased the Rockefeller Group in 1989.[197][199]

1990s to present [ edit ]

The Rockefeller Group filed for bankruptcy protection in May 1995 after missing several mortgage payments.[200][201] That November, John Rockefeller Jr.'s son David and a consortium led by Goldman Sachs agreed to buy Rockefeller Center's buildings for $1.1 billion,[202] beating out Sam Zell and other bidders.[203] The consortium, which also included Gianni Agnelli and Stavros Niarchos, finalized its acquisition in July 1996.[204] Before the sale was even completed, the consortium sold 1,600,000 square feet (150,000 m2) of space in 30 Rockefeller Plaza to NBC, who had rented that space in the tower since the beginning.[205] A preservation dispute arose in May 1998, when the owners announced plans to enlarge shop windows on the center's Fifth Avenue buildings to two stories.[206][207] These windows were reduced in size upon the LPC's request,[208][209] and the modifications were approved in September 1998.[208][210] Due to the decline of the newsreel theater industry, the Guild was shuttered in late 1999 after Tishman Speyer decided not to renew its lease.[211]

Tishman Speyer, led by David Rockefeller's close friend Jerry Speyer and the Lester Crown family of Chicago, bought the original 14 buildings and land in 2000 for $1.85 billion.[197][204][212] With the sale, the Rockefeller family gave up its remaining interest in Rockefeller Center's operation.[212] Tishman Speyer also decided to renovate the complex's retail spaces and underground concourse.[213] The Rainbow Room closed in 2009[214] in preparation for an extensive renovation that started in 2011.[215] The restaurant reopened in October 2014.[216] The Rockefeller family moved out of their offices in the GE Building in 2014 due to rising rents. They re-settled in less expensive offices on 49th Street, near their old headquarters.[106] The next year, in July 2015, the GE Building was renamed after Comcast, the parent company of NBCUniversal.[217][218] Future Green installed temporary artwork in the Channel Gardens in 2019 to celebrate the 250th anniversary of David Hosack's birth.[219]

In January 2020, Tishman Speyer hired Gabellini Sheppard Associates to design a renovation for Channel Gardens, Rockefeller Plaza, and the Lower Plaza. These plans included modifications to lighting, planting, pathways, and facades.[220][221] The plans were approved that April.[222] Gabellini Sheppard also proposed renovating the International Building's lobby.[223] A rooftop garden above Radio City Music Hall opened in September 2021.[224] Starting in 2022, a roller rink called Flipper's Roller Boogie Palace was set up in the Lower Plaza from April to October.[225][226] In addition, 19 eateries opened within Rockefeller Center during the early 2020s, including 12 sit-down restaurants.[227] In April 2023, Tishman Speyer proposed renovating ten of 10 Rockefeller Plaza's upper stories into a 130-room hotel.[228][229] At the time, 93 percent of the complex's office space was leased, but the offices were largely empty during workdays.[229] An event venue named Hero opened at Rockefeller Center that November.[230]

Buildings [ edit ]

The current complex is a combination of two building complexes and a standalone building: 13 of the original Art Deco office buildings from the 1930s, one building across 51st Street built in 1947, and a set of four International-style towers built along the west side of Avenue of the Americas during the 1960s and 1970s. The center spans 22 acres (8.9 ha) in total, with some 17,000,000 square feet (1,600,000 m2) in office space.[180]

Landmarked buildings [ edit ]

The landmarked buildings comprise 12 acres (49,000 m2) in Midtown, bounded by Fifth and Sixth avenues between 48th and 51st streets.[232] Built as a cohesive unit, the buildings have been owned by Tishman Speyer since 2000.[212] The buildings are spread along six blocks, with three blocks facing each avenue. These six blocks are the size of three standard blocks. One of the landmark buildings' defining features is the Indiana limestone facade possessed by all 14 structures, as specified in the original plans.[66] All of the structures were designed by Associated Architects, with Raymond Hood as the principal architect, and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.[6]

Radio City [ edit ]

30 Rockefeller Plaza and its former ""GE"" neon sign

The east side of Sixth Avenue, officially known as Avenue of the Americas,[235] contains most of the buildings that were built specifically for the proposed radio complex. These buildings, which comprise ""Radio City"", are 1230 Avenue of the Americas, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, Radio City Music Hall and 1270 Avenue of the Americas.[57] The idea for an integrated media complex somewhere came in 1920, when Owen D. Young, the chairman of RCA parent General Electric, suggested that RCA combine its then-disparate offices into one location.

The western half of the southernmost block of the complex along Sixth Avenue, between 48th and 49th streets, contains the former U.S. Rubber Company Building (now Simon & Schuster Building) at 1230 Avenue of the Americas. The last structure in the original complex to be built, it was topped out in November 1939.[115] The 23-story building contains two 7-story wings on its north and south sides. It was renamed after Uniroyal in 1967,[241] and again after Simon & Schuster in 1976.[242] 1230 Avenue of the Americas was expanded to the east in 1954 after the Center Theatre adjacent to it was demolished.[153] The 19-story annex, designed by Wallace Harrison and Max Abramovitz, had a glass facade on the lowest two stories—reflecting the design of the former American Airlines Building across Sixth Avenue—and a limestone facade above the second story. It is aligned with the axis of 10 Rockefeller Plaza on the eastern side of the block, and its northern and southern elevations contain five setbacks. The exterior also houses an abstract bas-relief created by Naum Gabo.

The Center Theatre, at 1236 Sixth Avenue, was the only structure in the original Rockefeller Center to be demolished. Originally the ""RKO Roxy Theatre"", it was renamed after Fox Theatres sued Roxy Rothafel over the naming rights to the nearby Roxy Theatre, which Rothafel had originally managed.[243] The 3,700-seat Center Theatre had a short massing (general shape) in place due to height restrictions at the time, which prohibited construction above theater auditoriums. The theater's stage was enlarged for musicals in 1936, and four years later, 380 seats were removed in order to make way for an ice rink for skating spectaculars. It showed film, musicals, ice-skating competitions, and television through its 21-year existence. Due to its duplication of the larger Radio City Music Hall's activities, it was deemed uneconomical almost from its opening, and was considered redundant by the 1950s. In 1954, it was replaced by the expansion of 1230 Avenue of the Americas.[153]

The block immediately to the north, on Sixth Avenue between 49th and 50th streets, is occupied by 30 Rockefeller Plaza and its western annex at 1250 Sixth Avenue. The 70-floor, 872-foot-tall (266 m) building anchors the entire complex, and is located on the eastern side of the block. Opened in 1933 as the RCA Building,[249] the building has been renamed multiple times, first to the GE Building in 1988, after General Electric bought RCA,[198] and then to the Comcast Building in 2014 after Comcast's purchase of NBCUniversal.[250][106] 30 Rockefeller Plaza was built as a single structure occupying the entire block between Sixth Avenue and Rockefeller Plaza, and its design was influenced by John Todd's desire for the building to use its air rights to their maximum potential. It has three main segments: the 66-story tower rising from the eastern part of the base with the famous Rainbow Room restaurant on the 65th floor, and, formerly, the Rockefeller family office;[106] a windowless segment in the middle of the base that houses NBC Studios;[253] and a shorter 16-story tower on the western part of the base at 1250 Avenue of the Americas. As an icon of the complex, 30 Rockefeller Plaza's architecture influenced the design of the rest of the complex, with its limestone facade and Gothic-inspired four-leafed spandrels.

The southwest corner of Radio City Music Hall, as seen diagonally across the intersection of Sixth Avenue and 50th Street

Radio City Music Hall at 1260 Avenue of the Americas, occupying the southwestern portion of the block between 50th and 51st streets. The only remaining theater in the complex, it was similar in style to the Center Theatre, but at a larger scale. Construction started in December 1931, and the hall opened in December 1932.[69][68] The 121-foot-high (37 m) Music Hall seats 6,000 people,[259] and since opening has seen over 300 million visitors.[260] Located in a niche adjacent to the neighboring 1270 Avenue of the Americas, the Music Hall is housed under the building's seventh-floor setback.

The other building on the block between 50th and 51st streets is 1270 Avenue of the Americas, a 31-story structure with a setback on the sixth floor. Originally named the RKO Building for RKO Pictures, it was built over the Music Hall, and shares many of the same exterior architectural details.[68] Construction of the building started in 1931,[63] and the building was complete by September 1932.[67] Henry Hofmeister designed the building, as well as several other office buildings in the city that were built over theaters. The building's entrance design, blending in with that of the other buildings in the Radio City section, is marked by three sculptural bas-reliefs created by Robert Garrison for each of the building's three bays, signifying muses of Contemporary Thought, Morning, and Evening.[265] In 1990, Robert Kushner created three bronze sculptures of winged spirits for the lobby. The RKO Building served as headquarters for its namesake company in the 1930s, and was renamed for the American Metal Climax Company (AMAX), its new owners, in the early 1960s.

International complex [ edit ]

The Channel Gardens between the British and French buildings, facing the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship

The International Complex is along Fifth Avenue, with the 41-story International Building and four smaller country-themed structures with retail outlets. The tower and the two southern retail buildings—were planned after the cancellation of the incongruously designed oval retail building in 1931, while the two retail wings east of the International Building were designed later. The low rectangular structures that replaced the oval building were seen as a more suitable design for the avenue. The current international theme was decided on due to a lack of American tenants willing to rent there; eventually, the structures were occupied by British, French, and Italian interests, although the Italian interests ultimately were the only foreign tenants who rented for the long term.

All four retail the structures have identical limestone facades, roof gardens, and ground-floor storefronts, but differ in the artworks with which they were decorated. Contemporary advertisements for shopping on Fifth Avenue touted the complex's proximity to the Saks Fifth Avenue flagship store and St. Patrick's Cathedral. When viewed from Fifth Avenue, the buildings provide a foreground for the taller 30 Rockefeller Plaza building behind them. The Channel Gardens separate the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise.

The southernmost of the four retail buildings is La Maison Francaise (literally ""the French House"") at 610 Fifth Avenue, which opened in October 1933. It is a six-story standalone building with a limestone facade with a sixth-story setback, as well as a partial 1+1⁄2-story penthouse on the west half of the seventh story and a garden on the east side of the seventh-story roof. Immediately across the Channel Gardens to the north of La Maison Francaise is its twin, the British Empire Building at 620 Fifth Avenue, which opened in April 1933. It is also a standalone building, with exactly the same massing asLa Maison Francaise, down to the setback, rooftop garden, and half-penthouse.

The 512-foot (156 m) International Building has the address 630 Fifth Avenue to its east, or 45 Rockefeller Plaza to its west. The tower stands at 41 stories high, including mechanical floors. One of two skyscrapers that opened in Manhattan in 1935, it was noted for its short 136-day duration of construction,[83] as well as the construction quality, overall design, and materials used. The building, located in the middle of the block between Rockefeller Plaza and Fifth Avenue, contains a central plaza on its east, facing the Fifth Avenue entrance, which contains the famous statue of Atlas. The Palazzo d'Italia and International Building North serve as six-story retail wings of the International Building.[279] The Palazzo d'Italia is at 626 Fifth Avenue, on the south side of the plaza, while International Building North is at 636 Fifth Avenue, north of the plaza.

Other buildings [ edit ]

The 36-story tower at 1 Rockefeller Plaza, on the east side of the plaza between 48th and 49th streets, is the original Time & Life Building that was opened in April 1937. Time Inc. itself did not move into the building for another year after its completion.[93] In 1960, the building was renamed for General Dynamics after Time Inc. had moved into 1271 Avenue of the Americas, the new Time-Life Building located three blocks away.[282] The tower was renamed for its street address after General Dynamics moved to St. Louis in 1971.[283]

10 Rockefeller Plaza is located opposite 1 Rockefeller, on the west side of the plaza. Its planning name was the Holland House, but the Dutch government did not sign on, so the building became the Eastern Air Lines Building instead. 10 Rockefeller was built as a 16-story slab, basically a miniature version of 1 Rockefeller. 10 Rockefeller's six-story parking garage was the first in Rockefeller Center. Notable modern tenants include the Today Show studios,[287] and since 2005, the Nintendo New York store.[288]

50 Rockefeller Plaza, formerly the Associated Press Building, is located on the west side of Rockefeller Plaza between 50th and 51st streets. It was constructed in the spring of 1938.[100] The only building in the Center built to the outer limits of its lot line, the 15-story building took its shape from Associated Press's need for a single, undivided, loft-like newsroom as large as the lot could accommodate—namely, a 200-by-187-foot (61 by 57 m) blocky structure with no setbacks.

600 Fifth Avenue is located at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 48th Street and was built after the other buildings in the main complex, opening in 1952. The 28-story tower was once also known as the Sinclair Oil Building and the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company Building. Its L-shaped footprint surrounds another building at the corner of 49th Street and Fifth Avenue,[161] such that it fronts 200 feet (61 m) on 48th Street, 100 feet (30 m) on Fifth Avenue, but only 63 feet (19 m) midblock on 49th Street.[161] Carson and Lundin designed 600 Fifth Avenue, along with 666 Fifth Avenue three blocks north, to complement the Rockefeller complex between the two towers.[161] 600 Fifth Avenue contains a limestone facade, consistent with that of the original complex, as well as a seventh-story setback on its Fifth Avenue side and rooftop gardens on its setbacks. The building contains a main lobby at 48th Street, a service entrance to the same street, and a connection to 1 Rockefeller Plaza at its west end. Unlike other buildings in the complex, 600 Fifth Avenue's ground level only contained one public entrance to maximize the ground-floor retail space, which was originally leased by Swiss interests[293] and Pan Am Airlines.

Later buildings [ edit ]

The buildings subsequently added are separately owned by multiple owners. The first subsequent building to be built was 75 Rockefeller Plaza, at 51st Street on the north end of the complex, was built in 1947.[140] The building contains a low base that is level with the rooftops of the low-rise buildings on 51st and 52nd Street, as well as a tall slab rising from the base, aligned in a north–south direction. It was originally built privately, but ownership was transferred to Rockefeller Center in February 1947.[139] The 33-story, 400-foot (120 m) building was originally called the Esso Building.[140] It was the headquarters of Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (later Exxon) until the early 1970s.[169] The Esso Building was later renamed after Warner Communications, Time Warner and AOL Time Warner. It is owned by the estate of Mohamed Al Fayed, who died in 2023,[294] and managed by RXR Realty under a 99-year lease that began in 2013.[295][296]

The other four buildings were built as part of a single project on the west side of Sixth Avenue between 47th and 51st streets.[297] Erected from 1958 through 1974, they were all built by the same firm, Harrison, Abramovitz & Harris. The $300 million project was part of a drive to get large companies such as Celanese Corporation, McGraw-Hill, Exxon, and Time Inc. to invest in the center.[297] The new project added a combined 6,100,000 square feet (570,000 m2) of space to the existing center when it was completed, and was attractive to potential tenants because of this.[168] Four buildings are part of the newer Sixth Avenue expansion:

Other architectural elements [ edit ]

The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree is placed annually in Rockefeller Center at the end of November.

Lower Plaza [ edit ]

At the front of 30 Rock is the Lower Plaza, located in the very center of the complex and below ground level.[304] The center plaza was part of the plans for the canceled Metropolitan Opera House. Although the opera house was canceled in 1929, the plaza was retained in subsequent plans. Originally, the plaza would have been located at ground level with a promenade called Channel Gardens, which led westward from Fifth Avenue to the plaza. In the March 1931 revision to the complex's blueprint, the center plaza was enhanced and sunken. The sunken plaza was originally supposed to be oval-shaped, but the plaza was later changed to a rectangular shape.[304] The sunken rectangular plaza, planted with shrubs, provided a sense of privacy and enclosure when it was originally built.

The plaza's main entrance is through the Channel Gardens, a 60-foot-wide (18 m), 200-foot-long (61 m) planted pedestrian esplanade running westward from Fifth Avenue between the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise. The steeply sloping promenade was originally furnished with six narrow pools in the center of the space, each surrounded by hedges. The pools are topped with fountain heads designed by Rene Chambellan, each representing a different attribute: leadership, will, thought, imagination, energy, and alertness. Chambellan also designed the fountains' drain covers with various bronze depictions of sea creatures such as turtles and crabs. During the winter, the Channel Gardens' fountains were shut off and decorated with Valerie Clarebout's sculptures of angels. The twelve sculptures, each measuring 8 feet (2.4 m) tall, have been placed in the gardens every winter since 1954. At the western end of the promenade is a plaque commemorating the original Elgin Gardens, as well as a bronze monumental plaque to John D. Rockefeller Jr (see below). From there, a flight of the steps descends toward the rink, then splits into two different stairs heading both north and south.

The western end of the plaza contains Paul Manship's 1934 masterwork, Prometheus.[75] The statue stands in a 60-by-16-foot (18.3 by 4.9 m) fountain basin in front of a grey rectangular wall. The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree is placed above the statue from November to January every year; it is usually put in place and lit the week after Thanksgiving, and taken down the week after New Year's Day.[318] The first tree was erected in 1934,[74] and as successive trees received more lavish decorations, the tradition gradually became known worldwide.[318]

The ice rink and Christmas tree

Much of the plaza's outdoor section is occupied by an ice rink. Installed in 1936, it replaced unprofitable retail space that had been constructed as part of the original center. Originally intended as a ""temporary"" measure,[88] the rink became an immediate tourist attraction upon opening, becoming one of the world's most famous skating rinks in later years.[320][89] In 1939, a permanent 120-by-60-foot (37 by 18 m) rink was installed, which necessitated the replacement of the center staircase from Channel Gardens.[321] Its popularity inspired the construction of a skating rink in the former Center Theatre, and for a short time, there were also proposals to convert the lower plaza's ice rink to a roller skating rink during the springtime.

Flagpoles at the Lower Plaza

The northern, southern, and eastern sides of the plaza are surrounded by a walkway that is several steps below street level, with staircases at either western end as well as at the plaza's Channel Gardens entrance. Some 200 flagpoles surround the plaza's perimeter at ground level, installed at regular intervals along the walkway and Rockefeller Plaza. The poles were installed in 1942 and were originally intended to be temporary.[325] The flags later became permanent installations, fitting in with the nearby International Complex. The poles originally displayed the flags of the United Nations' member countries, although in later years they also carried flags of the U.S. states and territories, or decorative and seasonal motifs.[326] Originally, there were 26 flags for each of the members of the United Nations,[325] but as more countries became UN members, additional rows of poles were added on the north and south sides of the plaza. During national and state holidays, every pole carries the flag of the United States.[326] The flags' ropes are secured with locks to prevent people from tampering with the flags.[328]

In July 1962, two years after John Rockefeller Jr.'s death, the center's management placed a plaque at the plaza, containing a list of ten principles in which he believed. The creed was first expressed in 1941. Rockefeller's beliefs include ""the supreme worth of the individual and in his right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" (the first principle) and ""truth and justice are fundamental to an enduring social order"" (the sixth principle).[329]

The architect I. M. Pei praised Rockefeller Center's lower plaza as being ""perhaps the most successful open space in the United States, perhaps in the world"", due to its success in drawing visitors. The plaza has also inspired similar developments around the world.

Rockefeller Plaza [ edit ]

Rockefeller Plaza

Rockefeller Plaza is a pedestrian street running through the complex, parallel to Fifth and Sixth avenues. This street was also part of the original plans for the Metropolitan Opera, and Benjamin Morris originally intended for the road to stretch from 42nd to 59th streets.[334] Only the 720-foot (220 m) section between 48th and 51st streets was built, and the road was open in its entirety by 1937.[73] The road was given the name ""Rockefeller Plaza"" in 1933,[72] despite the potential confusion with the Lower Plaza, because it was believed that the ""Plaza"" in the road's name would emphasize its ""spatial unity"" with the Lower Plaza and Channel Gardens. The original intention of the street's construction was to enhance the shopping district of Fifth Avenue, to its east,[72] but this never happened, and Rockefeller Plaza now primarily serves as a pedestrian passage that connects all of Rockefeller Center's separate components.

As with most numbered crosstown streets in Manhattan, Rockefeller Plaza is 30 feet (9.1 m) wide with curbs on either side of an asphalt surface. However, the sidewalks are much wider than on typical streets. In addition, Rockefeller Plaza is supported by a multi-level steel skeleton underneath, which houses the underground mall, storage rooms, and the complex's shipping and loading center.[336] As such, it contains a 14.5 inches (37 cm) layer of waterproofing. The surface of Rockefeller Plaza outside Radio City Music Hall, between 50th and 51st Street, contains small bronze circles for theatergoers to stand on while waiting to enter the hall. Until the 1980s, the plaza contained plaques that affirmed Columbia University's ownership of Rockefeller Center, but these were removed with the 1985 sale of the complex to the Rockefeller Group. Since Rockefeller Plaza is technically a purely private property to which the public is welcome, the plaza is closed for part of one day every year.[338]

Rooftop gardens [ edit ]

Gardens on the roofs of Rockefeller Center's International Complex, as viewed from the International Building

The gardens atop Rockefeller Center's roofs were designed by Ralph Hancock and Raymond Hood.[339][340] They came about because both Hood and Todd believed that rooftop gardens would enhance the complex's beauty; in particular, Hood compared the presence of rooftop gardens to the plants around a house.[46] Originally, the gardens were supposed to be all interconnected via bridges between the roofs of each building.[48] However, after Hood's death in 1935, the garden plan fell apart, as most of the complex's final buildings were built without provisions for gardens. The Associated Press Building's 15th-story roof, as well as the isolated location of the International Building and the high cost of these gardens, made this system infeasible. Ultimately, gardens were installed on 10 Rockefeller Plaza;[348] 30 Rockefeller Plaza;[349] the four International-themed retail buildings; the Center Theatre;[351] and Radio City Music Hall.[351][57] The gardens started running a $45,000-per-year deficit by 1937 due to various expenses as well as a lack of interest among tourists.

The largest and most grand of the gardens was the 0.75-acre (0.30 ha) ""Garden of the Nations"" (alternatively ""Gardens of the Nations""), which was installed on the eleventh-floor roof of 30 Rockefeller Plaza and opened in April 1935.[349] The construction effort involved 3,000 short tons (2,700 long tons) of soil; 100 short tons (89 long tons) of rock from as far as England; 100,000 bricks; 2,000 trees and shrubs; 4,000 small plants; and 20,000 bulbs for flowers.[340] They were originally composed of thirteen nation-specific gardens whose layouts were inspired by the gardens in the respective countries they represented. Each of the nation-themed gardens were separated by barriers.[349] There was an ""International Garden"", a rock garden, in the center of the thirteen nation-themed gardens,[339] which featured a meandering stream and 2,000 plant varieties. The Garden of the Nations also contained a children's garden, a modern-style garden, and a shrub-and-vegetable patch. Upon opening, the Garden of the Nations attracted many visitors because of its collection of exotic flora, and it became the most popular garden in Rockefeller Center. In its heyday, the Center charged admission fees for the Garden of the Nations. However, all of the nation-themed gardens were eventually removed, and the rock garden was left to dry up, supplanted by flower beds that were no longer open to the public.

The International complex's gardens fared better. Hancock developed the British Empire Building and La Maison Francaise's gardens, while A.M. van den Hoek designed the gardens atop the other two buildings. The British and French gardens both contain a lawn and pool surrounded by hedges, while the other two gardens atop the International Building's wings include ivy lawns surrounded by hedges. The Italian garden also contained a cobblestone walkway and two plaques from the Roman Forum, while International Building North's garden has a paved walkway with steps. The roof gardens of the International Building's wings were restored in 1986 for $48,000 each, followed by the gardens on the British and French buildings, which were restored the next year.[357]

In 2021, Tishman Speyer submitted proposals for a 24,000-square-foot (2,200 m2) rooftop terrace on Radio City Music Hall, as well as a pedestrian bridge to 50 Rockefeller Plaza. These plans dated from an original proposal for the theater that was never carried out.[358][359] The garden opened in September 2021[360] and is formally known as Radio Park.[361] Designed by the firm of HMWhite, the slightly sloped garden includes birch trees, a set of bleachers, and various pathways.[361]

Underground concourse [ edit ]

Exit from the concourse to the subway station

A series of shop- and restaurant-filled pedestrian passages stretch underground from 47th to 51st streets between Fifth and Seventh avenues. The pedestrian tunnel system was part of the updated 1931 plan for the center, and formal proposals for the system were submitted in 1933. It was supposed to comprise a system that stretched over 0.75 miles (1.21 km), all air-conditioned and lined with shops. Meanwhile, the pair of four-lane roadways was supposed to be located underneath the pedestrian mall, with delivery ramps leading to a 320-by-180-foot (98 by 55 m) central loading area 34 feet (10 m) below ground.[362] Later plans also included a people mover.[363]

Ultimately, the people mover was not built, but the 25-space mall opened in May 1935.[85] The complex's owner Tishman Speyer renovated the concourse in 1999 in an effort to make the underground retail space more noticeable and attract more upscale tenants.[213] The original bronze ornaments and lighting were replaced, air-conditioning was installed, two passageways were demolished, and both ground-level and underground retail spaces were refurbished as part of the renovation.[213]

The concourse is the uppermost level of the complex's four basement levels, as well as the only basement level open to the public.[336] The lower three levels are home to storage rooms and the complex's shipping center,[336] the latter of which is accessed by a delivery ramp at 50th Street.[366] Access is via lobby stairways in the six landmark buildings, through restaurants surrounding the concourse-level skating rink, and via elevators to the north and south of the rink. There is also a connection to the New York City Subway's 47th–50th Streets–Rockefeller Center station, serving the B, ​D, ​F, <F>, and ​M trains.[168][367] As of 2018 , the largest retailer in the concourse is Banana Republic.[367]

Pre-existing buildings [ edit ]

Two small buildings abut the north and south corners of the 30 Rockefeller Plaza annex. These buildings exist as a result of two tenants who refused to sell their rights to Rockefeller during construction. The grocer John F. Maxwell would only sell his property at Sixth Avenue and 50th Street if he received $1 million in return. However, Rockefeller's assistant Charles O. Heydt mistakenly said that Maxwell would never sell, and Maxwell himself said that he had never been approached by the Rockefellers. Consequently, Rockefeller Center did not purchase Maxwell's property until 1970. Maxwell's demand paled to that of Daniel Hurley and Patrick Daly, owners of a speakeasy who, since 1892, had leased a property at 49th Street. They would sell for $250 million, roughly the cost of the entire complex. They initially gained a lease extension until 1942, but ended up leasing their property until 1975, and was built around Maxwell's and Hurley and Daly's properties.

On the southeast corner of the complex, on Fifth Avenue between 48th and 49th streets, there were also two pre-existing buildings. Robert Walton Goelet owned a lot at 2–6 West 49th Street and wished to develop it; the lot was developed as 608 Fifth Avenue, which was completed in 1932.[370] The St. Nicholas Church, located on 48th Street behind Goelet's land, also refused to sell the property despite an offer of up to $7 million for the property.[371] The church was razed in 1949 to make way for 600 Fifth Avenue.[147]

Art [ edit ]

In November 1931, John Todd suggested the creation of a program for placing distinctive artworks within each of the buildings. Hartley Burr Alexander, a noted mythology and symbology professor, was tasked with planning the complex's arts installations.[374] Alexander submitted his plan for the site's artwork in December 1932. As part of the proposal, the complex would have a variety of sculptures, statues, murals, friezes, decorative fountains, and mosaics.[374] In an expansion of Hood's setback-garden plan, Alexander's proposal also included rooftop gardens atop all the buildings,[374] which would create a ""Babylonian garden"" when viewed from above.[375][46]

At first, Alexander suggested ""Homo Fabor, Man the Builder"" as the complex's overarching theme, representing satisfaction with one's occupation rather than with the wage. However, that theme was not particularly well received by the architects, so Alexander proposed another theme, the ""New Frontiers""; this theme dealt with social and scientific innovations and represented the challenges that humanity faced ""after the conquest of the physical world"". In theory, this was considered a fitting theme, but Alexander had been so specific about the details of the necessary artworks that it limited the creative license for any artists who would be commissioned for such works, so he was fired. It took several tries to agree on the current theme, ""The March of Civilization"", at which point some of the art had already been commissioned, including those which Alexander had proposed.

The art that currently exists within Rockefeller Center was inspired by Professor Alexander's arts program.[374] Sculptor Lee Lawrie contributed the largest number of individual pieces – twelve, including the Atlas statue facing Fifth Avenue and the conspicuous friezes of Wisdom above the main entrance to 30 Rockefeller Plaza. Edward Trumbull coordinated the colors of the works located inside the buildings, and Léon-Victor Solon did the same job for the exterior pieces. Isamu Noguchi's gleaming stainless steel bas-relief, News, over the main entrance to 50 Rockefeller Plaza (the Associated Press Building) was, at the time of commissioning, the largest metal bas-relief in the world. The complex's other sculptors included Rene Chambellan, Leo Friedlander, Robert Garrison, Alfred Janniot, Carl Paul Jennewein, Gaston Lachaise, Leo Lentelli, Paul Manship, Giacomo Manzù, Hildreth Meiere, and Attilio Piccirilli. Other artists included Carl Milles, Margaret Bourke-White, and Dean Cornwell, who executed the mural The History of Transportation in the lobby of the Eastern Airlines building (today 10 Rockefeller Plaza). Radio City Music Hall architect Donald Deskey commissioned many Depression-era artists to design works for the interior of the hall,[384] including Stuart Davis's 1932 mural Men Without Women, named after the short story collection by Ernest Hemingway that had been published the same year.[387] One of the center's more controversial works was Man at the Crossroads, created by Diego Rivera, which was originally commissioned for 30 Rockefeller Plaza's lobby but was demolished before it could be completed.[390]

Statues [ edit ]

Atlas [ edit ]

Commissioned in 1936 and executed by Lee Lawrie and Rene Chambellan, the Atlas statue is located in the International Building's courtyard. It faces eastward toward St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue. The statue depicts Atlas the titan, with exaggerated muscles, supporting the celestial vault on his shoulders.

Prometheus [ edit ]

Paul Manship's highly recognizable bronze gilded Prometheus statue, commissioned in 1934, is located at the western end of the sunken plaza. It stands 18 feet (5.5 m) high and weighs 8 short tons (7.1 long tons).[75] The statue depicts the Greek legend of the Titan Prometheus recumbent, bringing fire to mankind. The statue is flanked by two smaller gilded representations of Youth and Maiden, which were relocated to Palazzo d'Italia from 1939 to 1984 because Manship thought the representations did not fit visually.[394] The model for Prometheus was Leonardo (Leon) Nole,[395] and the inscription, a paraphrase from Aeschylus, on the granite wall behind, reads: ""Prometheus, teacher in every art, brought the fire that hath proved to mortals a means to mighty ends.""

Man at the Crossroads [ edit ]

Man, Controller of the Universe, a recreation of the destroyed Man at the Crossroads mural in 30 Rockefeller Plaza's lobby

In 1932, the Mexican socialist artist Diego Rivera (whose sponsor was the Museum of Modern Art and whose patron at the time was Abby Aldrich Rockefeller, the wife of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.), was commissioned by their son Nelson to create a color fresco for the 1,071-square-foot (99 m2) wall in the lobby of the then-RCA Building. This came after Nelson had been unable to secure the commissioning of either Matisse or Picasso. Previously Rivera had painted a controversial fresco in Detroit titled Detroit Industry, commissioned by Abby and John's friend, Edsel Ford, who later became a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art.

As expected, his Man at the Crossroads became controversial, as it contained Moscow May Day scenes and a clear portrait of Lenin, which had not been apparent in initial sketches. After Nelson issued a written warning to Rivera to replace the offending figure with an anonymous face, Rivera refused (after offering to counterbalance Lenin with a portrait of Lincoln). As per Nelson's orders, Rivera was paid for his commission and the mural was papered over. Nine months later, after all attempts to save the fresco were explored—including relocating it to Abby's Museum of Modern Art—it was destroyed as a last option.[390][402][403] (Rivera would later partially recreate the work as Man, Controller of the Universe, using photographs taken by an assistant, Lucienne Bloch.)[404] Rivera's fresco in the center was replaced with a larger mural by the Catalan artist Josep Maria Sert, titled American Progress, depicting a vast allegorical scene of men constructing modern America. Containing figures of Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, it wraps around the west wall of 30 Rockefeller Plaza's Grand Lobby.

Reception [ edit ]

In its earliest years, Rockefeller Center received largely negative and pessimistic reviews from architectural critics. The most cynical opinion came from architectural scholar Lewis Mumford, who so hated the ""weakly conceived, reckless, romantic chaos"" of the March 1931 plans for Rockefeller Center that he reportedly went into exile in upstate New York. He blamed John Rockefeller Jr. for the complex's ""inability to consider a new type of problem in any form except the skyscraper stereotype"". Mumford's view of the complex was only marginally less negative when he revisited the issue in December 1933: he said that it could be ""large, exciting, [and] romantic"" at night, but that ""a mountain or ash heap of the same size would do the trick almost as well, if the lights were cleverly arranged"". Ralph Adams Cram, who adhered to a more classical architectural style, also had a pessimistic view of the plans unveiled in March 1931. He called the plan for Rockefeller Center ""an apotheosis of megalomania, a defiant egotism"" arising from an ostentatious display of wealth, and said that ""the sooner we accomplish the destiny it so perfectly foreshadows, the sooner we shall be able to clear the ground and begin again"". Douglas Haskell, who formerly edited Architectural Forum magazine, wrote that Rockefeller Center's ambiance was ""gray, unreal, baleful"".

The urban planner Le Corbusier had a more optimistic view of the complex, expressing that Rockefeller Center was ""rational, logically conceived, biologically normal, [and] harmonious"". He wrote that although Rockefeller Center would inevitably be disorganized in its earliest years, it would eventually adhere to a certain ""order"", and he also praised the complex for being a paragon of ""noble"" and ""efficient"" construction. The writer Frederick Lewis Allen took a more moderate viewpoint, saying that negative critics had ""hoped for too much"" precisely because Rockefeller Center had been planned during an economically prosperous time, but was constructed during the Depression.[415] Even though Allen thought that the art was mediocre and the opportunities for a less lively complex were wasted, he stated that Rockefeller Center had an aura of ""festivity"" around it, unlike most other office buildings in America.[415] Sigfried Giedion wrote in his book Space, Time and Architecture that Rockefeller Center's design was akin to a ""civic center"" whose design represented the 1930s version of the future.[417] Henry Luce, the founder of Time Inc., said in 1941 that Rockefeller Center represented ""the true world of tomorrow"", as opposed to the 1939 New York World's Fair, whose ""World of Tomorrow"" representations ""are today junk piles under the winter snow"". Novelist Gertrude Stein said in 1935, ""The view of Rockefeller Center from Fifth Avenue is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.""

By the 1940s, most critics had positive views of Rockefeller Center. Even Mumford praised the complex, lamenting in 1947 that the new headquarters of the United Nations on First Avenue had no ""human scale"" or ""transition from the intimate to the monumental"", whereas Rockefeller Center's buildings ""produce an aesthetic effect out of all proportion to their size"".[422] Haskell wrote in 1966 that Rockefeller Center's designers ""seemed to have regarded urban life as an enhanceable romance"". In 1969, the art historian Vincent Scully wrote, ""Rockefeller Center is one of the few surviving public spaces that look as if they were designed and used by people who knew what stable wealth was and were not ashamed to enjoy it.""[424]

The New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation commissioned a report in 1974 titled ""Grand Central Terminal and Rockefeller Center: A Historic-Critical Estimate of Their Significance"", in which they concluded that Rockefeller Center, along with Central Park and Grand Central Terminal, were the only three developments that could slow down Manhattan's ""remorseless process of expansion and decay"". In 1976, New York Times architectural critic Paul Goldberger wrote, ""What makes Rockefeller Center work is that it is at once a formal Beaux‐Arts‐influenced complex of dignified towers and a lively, utterly contemporary amalgam of shops, plazas and street life. It is as natural a home for a 1970's street festival as for a 1930's movie about cafe society: few designs can join such disparate worlds so comfortably.""[426] The American Institute of Architects' 2007 survey List of America's Favorite Architecture ranked the Rockefeller Center complex among the top 150 buildings in the United States.[427][428]

Several later buildings were inspired by Rockefeller Center and its constituent buildings. 525 William Penn Place in Pittsburgh, also designed by Harrison & Abramovitz, includes limestone piers and steel fins that were inspired by 30 Rockefeller Plaza's design.[429] In the 1960s, David Rockefeller developed the Embarcadero Center in San Francisco, which was nicknamed ""Rockefeller Center West"".[430][431] Postmodern skyscrapers based on Rockefeller Center include the NBC Tower in Chicago[432] and the Wells Fargo Center in Minneapolis.[433][434]

251,Rooms and Spaces Every Business Office Should Have,https://hire.trakstar.com/business-guides/employee-and-office-management/business-office-rooms-spaces,,"Rooms and Spaces Every Business Office Should Have

5 min read

Your company’s office is more than just the space people work in. In many ways, it’s the home away from home for your hardworking employees.

Just like an ideal home, your office should be a comfortable space that people enjoy being in. It should encourage inspiration, creativity and productivity – and reflect your company’s culture.

In order for your employees to do their best work, your office should have different rooms and spaces that meet their various needs.

In this business guide, you’ll learn what rooms and spaces your workplace should have and the benefits each area brings to your staff and company.

Must Have Office Rooms and Spaces

Meeting and conference rooms

Meeting rooms and offices go hand in hand. The number of meeting rooms your company should have depends on your employee count, the layout out of your workspace and the frequency your employees have meetings. Here are some different types of meeting rooms worth considering:

Large conferences rooms – A big space with a presentation screen and plenty of seating.

Small meeting rooms – An intimate space for meetings with 5 or so people.

Brainstorming rooms – An isolated space with a marker board for coming up with great ideas. This space can also double as your small meeting room.

Videoconferencing rooms – A room equipped with a webcam and monitor for video calls is a must in the modern workplace.

Reception and greeting area

Every workplace needs an area separate from the main workspace that visitors enter. It should include comfortable seating so visitors can wait for their host to take them into the main office.

Phone rooms

If your company has an open office, it’s good to provide your employees with small rooms for taking private calls. These spaces prevent one person from dropping in on a meeting room that might be reserved for use by others.

Kitchen

Some companies have extravagant cafeterias or kitchens stocked liked a 7/11 store. Everyone likes being treated to good food but many companies can’t afford to feed their entire staff.

Your office should at least have a kitchen area where your staff can store and prepare their own meals. No one likes working on an empty stomach so providing your staff with a refrigerator, coffee maker, microwave and other small appliances can make a big difference in your workplace.

Common area

It’s important to have an area in your workplace where people can socialize without distracting others.

An ideal common area should be separate from the main workspace and be a relaxing environment. Just like a common area at home, it should include comfortable seating so employees can take a load off when they need to.

Wellness room

This is a critical but often overlooked space in many workplaces. A wellness room is a private space where employees can tend to their personal health needs. It’s particularly beneficial to working new mothers who need a private space to breastfeed.

Think of this room like the nurse’s office in elementary school. It doesn’t need to be staffed by a nurse but it should include a first aid kit and other health and wellness materials employees may need.

IT room

An IT room serves as the hub for all your office’s technology. If your company has onsite servers, they’ll need to be stored in secure, climate-controlled room.

This room should also be where expensive computers and other electronics are securely stored and properly maintained.

Webinar and recording room

This room is a must if your company is serious about webinar, podcast or video recording. It should be soundproofed to block outside noise, like a music studio. Your recording room should also have professional microphones, headphones and other equipment that helps your employees produce great multimedia content.

Nice to have office rooms and spaces

The rooms listed to this point should be found in most modern offices. Here are a few more bonus spaces that can take your workplace to the the next level:

Outdoor space

Being inside all day can be tough so it’s important for people to take a moment to get some fresh air and sunshine. An outdoor patio or green space next to your building is nice to have but not completely necessary. If your company can’t provide an outdoor space, your employees will likely find a nearby park or pleasant street to walk on for getting their outside time.

Bike storage space

A secure space for employee bike storage is great to have, especially if your workplace is an urban area. More and more people are choosing to bike to work, instead of driving or using public transit, but need to know their bike is safe while they’re working.

Fitness area

Office gyms and company fitness classes have become hip perks to offer. It can seem excessive but remember that healthy employees are more productive, less stressed and generally happier.

It’s great if your company can provide an on-site gym or studio for fitness classes but it’s not a must. There are different wellness programs you can offer to promote employee health.

Locker room and showers

If your office does have a fitness area, it should also include a locker room and showers so your employees can clean up post-workout.

It’s still a nice-to-have room, even if your office doesn’t have a fitness area. Employees who bike to work or go for a run on their lunch break will happily make use of this area .

Give your employees the spaces they need to be great

Offices have evolved from cubicles under fluorescent lights to unique spaces that employees enjoy spending the day in. Ensuring your workspace has the right rooms and spaces creates an environment where your staff can do great work.",considering new office space

The Bloomington-based company recently bought 142 acres in an industrial park in Sioux Falls where it intends to build a 700,000-square-foot production facility and employ 600 people.

When the project was first proposed in 2021, it had a price tag of about $500 million.

""Our investment in this world-class Asian-style food plant in South Dakota will help us strengthen our position in one of the fastest-growing food categories in the United States,"" Schwan's CEO Brian Schiegg said in a statement.

Schwan's is also opening a regional office in downtown Sioux Falls that will employ 50 to 100 people.

No timeline was given for construction. When open, the plant will turn out Bibigo brand dumplings and other frozen and shelf-stable products.

""The ability to continue to scale our portfolio of products to meet the growing consumer demand is vitally important to our strategy,"" Minsok Pak, CEO of Schwan's parent company CJ Foods, said in a news release. ""This facility will enable us to further accelerate the growth of K-Food and other Asian cuisines.""

South Korea's CJ CheilJedang in 2019 bought a majority stake in Schwan's for $1.8 billion.

Schwan's makes Red Baron and Freschetta pizza, Pagoda egg rolls and a number of other products sold at grocery stores and in restaurants, schools and other food service outlets. The Schwan family still owns the home delivery business, now known as Yelloh.

The sale price for the land was not disclosed, but at the advertised rate of $4 per square foot it may have cost around $24 million. The project will include a new wastewater treatment facility on site to minimize impacts to existing infrastructure in South Dakota's largest city.

Summary

Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.

Introduction

In the world of software management there exists a dreaded place called “dependency hell.” The bigger your system grows and the more packages you integrate into your software, the more likely you are to find yourself, one day, in this pit of despair.

In systems with many dependencies, releasing new package versions can quickly become a nightmare. If the dependency specifications are too tight, you are in danger of version lock (the inability to upgrade a package without having to release new versions of every dependent package). If dependencies are specified too loosely, you will inevitably be bitten by version promiscuity (assuming compatibility with more future versions than is reasonable). Dependency hell is where you are when version lock and/or version promiscuity prevent you from easily and safely moving your project forward.

As a solution to this problem, we propose a simple set of rules and requirements that dictate how version numbers are assigned and incremented. These rules are based on but not necessarily limited to pre-existing widespread common practices in use in both closed and open-source software. For this system to work, you first need to declare a public API. This may consist of documentation or be enforced by the code itself. Regardless, it is important that this API be clear and precise. Once you identify your public API, you communicate changes to it with specific increments to your version number. Consider a version format of X.Y.Z (Major.Minor.Patch). Bug fixes not affecting the API increment the patch version, backward compatible API additions/changes increment the minor version, and backward incompatible API changes increment the major version.

We call this system “Semantic Versioning.” Under this scheme, version numbers and the way they change convey meaning about the underlying code and what has been modified from one version to the next.

Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer)

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Software using Semantic Versioning MUST declare a public API. This API could be declared in the code itself or exist strictly in documentation. However it is done, it SHOULD be precise and comprehensive. A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch version. Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0. Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications MUST be released as a new version. Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable. Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version number is incremented after this release is dependent on this public API and how it changes. Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if only backward compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior. Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if new, backward compatible functionality is introduced to the public API. It MUST be incremented if any public API functionality is marked as deprecated. It MAY be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code. It MAY include patch level changes. Patch version MUST be reset to 0 when minor version is incremented. Major version X (X.y.z | X > 0) MUST be incremented if any backward incompatible changes are introduced to the public API. It MAY also include minor and patch level changes. Patch and minor versions MUST be reset to 0 when major version is incremented. A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphens [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST NOT include leading zeroes. Pre-release versions have a lower precedence than the associated normal version. A pre-release version indicates that the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as denoted by its associated normal version. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha, 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7, 1.0.0-x.7.z.92, 1.0.0-x-y-z.--. Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch or pre-release version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphens [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Build metadata MUST be ignored when determining version precedence. Thus two versions that differ only in the build metadata, have the same precedence. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha+001, 1.0.0+20130313144700, 1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85, 1.0.0+21AF26D3----117B344092BD. Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when ordered. Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version into major, minor, patch and pre-release identifiers in that order (Build metadata does not figure into precedence). Precedence is determined by the first difference when comparing each of these identifiers from left to right as follows: Major, minor, and patch versions are always compared numerically. Example: 1.0.0 < 2.0.0 < 2.1.0 < 2.1.1. When major, minor, and patch are equal, a pre-release version has lower precedence than a normal version: Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0. Precedence for two pre-release versions with the same major, minor, and patch version MUST be determined by comparing each dot separated identifier from left to right until a difference is found as follows: Identifiers consisting of only digits are compared numerically. Identifiers with letters or hyphens are compared lexically in ASCII sort order. Numeric identifiers always have lower precedence than non-numeric identifiers. A larger set of pre-release fields has a higher precedence than a smaller set, if all of the preceding identifiers are equal. Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 < 1.0.0-alpha.beta < 1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0-beta.2 < 1.0.0-beta.11 < 1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0.

Why Use Semantic Versioning?

This is not a new or revolutionary idea. In fact, you probably do something close to this already. The problem is that “close” isn’t good enough. Without compliance to some sort of formal specification, version numbers are essentially useless for dependency management. By giving a name and clear definition to the above ideas, it becomes easy to communicate your intentions to the users of your software. Once these intentions are clear, flexible (but not too flexible) dependency specifications can finally be made.

A simple example will demonstrate how Semantic Versioning can make dependency hell a thing of the past. Consider a library called “Firetruck.” It requires a Semantically Versioned package named “Ladder.” At the time that Firetruck is created, Ladder is at version 3.1.0. Since Firetruck uses some functionality that was first introduced in 3.1.0, you can safely specify the Ladder dependency as greater than or equal to 3.1.0 but less than 4.0.0. Now, when Ladder version 3.1.1 and 3.2.0 become available, you can release them to your package management system and know that they will be compatible with existing dependent software.

As a responsible developer you will, of course, want to verify that any package upgrades function as advertised. The real world is a messy place; there’s nothing we can do about that but be vigilant. What you can do is let Semantic Versioning provide you with a sane way to release and upgrade packages without having to roll new versions of dependent packages, saving you time and hassle.

If all of this sounds desirable, all you need to do to start using Semantic Versioning is to declare that you are doing so and then follow the rules. Link to this website from your README so others know the rules and can benefit from them.

FAQ

How should I deal with revisions in the 0.y.z initial development phase?

The simplest thing to do is start your initial development release at 0.1.0 and then increment the minor version for each subsequent release.

How do I know when to release 1.0.0?

If your software is being used in production, it should probably already be 1.0.0. If you have a stable API on which users have come to depend, you should be 1.0.0. If you’re worrying a lot about backward compatibility, you should probably already be 1.0.0.

Doesn’t this discourage rapid development and fast iteration?

Major version zero is all about rapid development. If you’re changing the API every day you should either still be in version 0.y.z or on a separate development branch working on the next major version.

If even the tiniest backward incompatible changes to the public API require a major version bump, won’t I end up at version 42.0.0 very rapidly?

This is a question of responsible development and foresight. Incompatible changes should not be introduced lightly to software that has a lot of dependent code. The cost that must be incurred to upgrade can be significant. Having to bump major versions to release incompatible changes means you’ll think through the impact of your changes, and evaluate the cost/benefit ratio involved.

Documenting the entire public API is too much work!

It is your responsibility as a professional developer to properly document software that is intended for use by others. Managing software complexity is a hugely important part of keeping a project efficient, and that’s hard to do if nobody knows how to use your software, or what methods are safe to call. In the long run, Semantic Versioning, and the insistence on a well defined public API can keep everyone and everything running smoothly.

What do I do if I accidentally release a backward incompatible change as a minor version?

As soon as you realize that you’ve broken the Semantic Versioning spec, fix the problem and release a new minor version that corrects the problem and restores backward compatibility. Even under this circumstance, it is unacceptable to modify versioned releases. If it’s appropriate, document the offending version and inform your users of the problem so that they are aware of the offending version.

That would be considered compatible since it does not affect the public API. Software that explicitly depends on the same dependencies as your package should have their own dependency specifications and the author will notice any conflicts. Determining whether the change is a patch level or minor level modification depends on whether you updated your dependencies in order to fix a bug or introduce new functionality. We would usually expect additional code for the latter instance, in which case it’s obviously a minor level increment.

What if I inadvertently alter the public API in a way that is not compliant with the version number change (i.e. the code incorrectly introduces a major breaking change in a patch release)?

Use your best judgment. If you have a huge audience that will be drastically impacted by changing the behavior back to what the public API intended, then it may be best to perform a major version release, even though the fix could strictly be considered a patch release. Remember, Semantic Versioning is all about conveying meaning by how the version number changes. If these changes are important to your users, use the version number to inform them.

How should I handle deprecating functionality?

Deprecating existing functionality is a normal part of software development and is often required to make forward progress. When you deprecate part of your public API, you should do two things: (1) update your documentation to let users know about the change, (2) issue a new minor release with the deprecation in place. Before you completely remove the functionality in a new major release there should be at least one minor release that contains the deprecation so that users can smoothly transition to the new API.

Does SemVer have a size limit on the version string?

No, but use good judgment. A 255 character version string is probably overkill, for example. Also, specific systems may impose their own limits on the size of the string.

Is “v1.2.3” a semantic version?

No, “v1.2.3” is not a semantic version. However, prefixing a semantic version with a “v” is a common way (in English) to indicate it is a version number. Abbreviating “version” as “v” is often seen with version control. Example: git tag v1.2.3 -m ""Release version 1.2.3"" , in which case “v1.2.3” is a tag name and the semantic version is “1.2.3”.

Is there a suggested regular expression (RegEx) to check a SemVer string?

There are two. One with named groups for those systems that support them (PCRE [Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, i.e. Perl, PHP and R], Python and Go).

See: https://regex101.com/r/Ly7O1x/3/

^(?P<major>0|[1-9]\d*)\.(?P<minor>0|[1-9]\d*)\.(?P<patch>0|[1-9]\d*)(?:-(?P<prerelease>(?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*)(?:\.(?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*))*))?(?:\+(?P<buildmetadata>[0-9a-zA-Z-]+(?:\.[0-9a-zA-Z-]+)*))?$

And one with numbered capture groups instead (so cg1 = major, cg2 = minor, cg3 = patch, cg4 = prerelease and cg5 = buildmetadata) that is compatible with ECMA Script (JavaScript), PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions, i.e. Perl, PHP and R), Python and Go.

See: https://regex101.com/r/vkijKf/1/

^(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)\.(0|[1-9]\d*)(?:-((?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*)(?:\.(?:0|[1-9]\d*|\d*[a-zA-Z-][0-9a-zA-Z-]*))*))?(?:\+([0-9a-zA-Z-]+(?:\.[0-9a-zA-Z-]+)*))?$

199,Should You Add a Second Office Location? 5 Factors to ...,https://thereceptionist.com/blog/should-you-add-a-second-office-location-5-factors-to-consider/,,"If you’re considering expanding your office by adding another location, things are probably going well. Your organization may be hiring, running out of room, or trying to expand into a new market.

A healthy, growing business can be exciting. Expansion may be something that you’ve always wanted or hoped for. Now, it looks like the time may have come.

However, as you probably know, investing in a new office location is not something you should rush into. Wrong choices in the expansion process can cause cash flow problems, operations problems, and culture problems that can have big repercussions.

Before you get too serious about a new location, consider the following questions carefully.

Can you afford it?

This question might seem pretty straightforward, but in some cases, there are hidden expenses that come along with a new location that can throw your budget off quickly.

As we discussed in our post How to Evaluate a Potential Office Space, you need to get a solid handle on which amenities and services are included in your rent or lease costs, and which you’ll have to pay for yourself. These include things like maintenance and landscaping for a standalone property, or services like shared security or shared cleaning services in a shared office building.

You’ll also need to do your due diligence into how much monetary value a new location can add to your organization. Perks such as easy street access and high visibility can be great for attracting new clients, depending on your industry. If you won’t be getting those with the new location, the projected business growth might not offset your expenses as much as you’d initially expect.

Finally, if you’re going to be running the same business out of two separate locations, there might be additional operational costs required. For example, you might have a harder time tracking shared inventory or supplies. Staff who work out of both locations or even travel between them occasionally may need to be reimbursed for travel expenses, which can add up.

Either way, a new office investment isn’t something you should have any hesitations about being able to afford. If you’re considering expansion, business should be booming, and cash flow projections should be super healthy.

Can you get more use out of your existing space?

If you already run one office location, you know that a physical office is a major expense, regardless of how much value it adds in other ways.

That’s why it’s always a good idea to ask whether there’s any way to make your existing space work for your needs.

If the issue is crowding, consider some out-of-the-box ways to get more space.

Specifically, you could shift to an activity-based office design where employees don’t necessarily have assigned desks, but can choose a workspace based on the type of work they’re doing. For example, they can go into phone booths for phone calls, breakout spaces for one-on-one meetings or brainstorming, and conference rooms for larger meetings.

We discuss more about activity-based design and other ways to make your office more flexible in our article 7 Ways to Get More Value From Your Office Space.

Another outside-the-box idea for an office-space-saver: Allowing your employees to work remotely. Besides potentially saving you the huge expense of investing in a second location by minimizing employee space needs, work-from-home options may boost morale and productivity. Plus, it’s eco-friendly because it cuts down on commutes and reduces office energy consumption.

How will a new location affect your office culture?

If your plan is to move some of your existing employees to work out of a new location, you’ll have to think through what message those choices will send to the rest of the staff, and how it will affect morale.

As we wrote in our post How to Plan for an Office Move, employees always have a lot of expectations and strong opinions about where they want to work.

They may have a lot invested personally in the existing office location, for example. Maybe a new location would mean a longer commute or less convenient parking. On the other hand, some employees or departments may feel unappreciated or passed over if they’re not selected for the new location.

Employee turnover is expensive, and poor morale hurts productivity. See if you can get a clear idea about what’s important to your employees before you invest in a new location.

Will the new location add operational friction?

It takes plenty of mental energy to manage multiple office locations, regardless of how independent they are of each other.

Of course, there’s a lot of work required just to get the new location up and running, from selecting the site to managing the lease to furnishing the space. You’ll also have a lot of smaller details to take care of, from updating your company website and maps listings, to getting the word out in your network and in the community about the new location.

But the real extra work tends to pop up on a day-to-day operations level. For example, how will managers keep tabs on what’s happening at the other location on a regular basis? Will having your employees spread out across locations affect the way they communicate? Will all employees still have access to the resources and supplies they need?

Take a look at your existing workflows and really think through how a new location would change them, for better or worse.

Also, consider that extra complications might arise if you’re locating your new office in another jurisdiction, such as another state or even another town. You might find yourself dealing with a completely different set of legal regulations that can change things like how you pay taxes to how you have to hold emergency drills.

Are your systems ready to scale?

If the new location will be operating mostly independently of the original location, internal workflows should be documented, streamlined, and ready to scale long before you try to duplicate it all in a new place.

You’ve been successful in your current location, but a new location can bring new challenges and a lot of changes. Don’t take anything for granted. Analyze your workflows for any inefficiencies before you grow. Make them as simple and consistent as possible so that they can be followed easily in the new location.

Software can play a critical role in smoothly duplicating your systems and processes in new locations.

The programs you use for things like accounting, billing, and marketing should let you add and manage any new locations incorporated into your business. Managers should be able to get an overall view of operations, as well as drill down to the specific data for individual locations. If your tools aren’t growth-friendly, it might be time to switch to some that are.

For example, The Receptionist visitor management software has a locations dashboard that shows visitor data for each location. Users can apply unique branding and preferences to specific locations, or apply changes to all locations at once. They can even assign different rights to specific locations for their employees.

238,Should Your Company Rent Coworking Space or ...,https://www.greetly.com/blog/should-your-company-rent-coworking-space-or-lease-your-own-office,,"Congratulations! Your company is growing, revenue is going up and you are hiring new employees. Now it's time to determine something you may have never considered before - your real estate and office strategy. Perhaps you'll explore a remote workforce or however, there are many clear benefits of working in the office.

More and more early-stage companies are opting for using coworking spaces in lieu of leasing a traditional office space. At the same time, small and medium business searches for private offices grew 40% per month in 2017, according to the office broker platform Hubble.

Which approach is best for your organization? Here we break down the benefits of each real estate option.

The Benefits of Coworking Spaces

The shared workspace is a fast-rising trend. Today we are seeing a merging of more traditional serviced offices with the original coworking spaces, which were essentially open floorplans. Interest in private offices within coworking workplaces is on the rise, and some of the world's largest companies are getting into the action. Here is why.

Cost

Coworking spaces are much more affordable in the short term, with the cost in New York City starting as low as $150 per month. Plus, commitments are much shorter than a traditional lease; often just month-to-month. If your isn't ready to make a major cash commitment, you could maintain a lot of flexibility working out of a coworking space.

Compare that to the cost of building out your own office space. JLL reviewed data from 2,800 projects across the US and Canada in 2017. They found that office fit out - the cost of designing, construction, and furnishing a workspace - also known as tenant improvements. The study showed a range between $120.18 and $216.07 per square foot. The variation was due to the features selected and the market. While these costs can be negotiated as part of a lease, they are incorporated into your coworking rental.

Community

Almost by definition, coworking spaces surround you with a community, making it easy for you and your employees to network with the other companies in the space. You can stay on top of industry news, learn from their functional peers and even find a mentor outside the organization's easily shared workspace. They might even be your next hire. While this is important for workers at every stage of their career, this will be especially meaningful if you have a younger workforce.

Events

The best-shared workspaces offer coworking events that can help bring your team together to enjoy some quality time after hours. This is another great chance for networking with the companies and people around you. Before you choose a space, ask to see their upcoming events calendar and look for a variety of social and learning - and, ideally, charitable - opportunities.

Smart Office

From strong Wifi to collaboration areas, when you lease a coworking space, you no longer need to make sure your office is using the greatest productivity tools. Your shared workspace should be a fully digital office utilizing coworking software that maximizes your team's productivity.

Turnkey

Don't sweat the details. Let your landlord set up your new office for you, including buying all of the furniture and maintaining the equipment. You won't need to hire a dedicated office manager. If nothing else, this approach is easy, and we like easy!

Bonus: Balance sheet

For the financially inclined founders, there are GAAP principles too. Having a long-term lease, 12 months or longer, means long-term assets and liabilities on your balance sheet. Since most coworking terms are month-to-month, you'll leave your accountant twiddling his or her thumbs.

The Benefits of Leasing Your Own Office

Over 98% of commercial real estate is the traditional office. The workplace evolved in this manner for good reason. Here are the advantages of leasing your own office to house your organization.

Focus and Privacy

Your own office is ideal for helping your team focus. Your employees won't be distracted by other companies around them so they can be more productive during the day. Because a tactic helped another company grow (and did it really?) doesn't mean it will for yours - your situation is unique.

If your team needs to discuss sensitive information, they won't have to worry about being overheard. Many companies benefit from the privacy of their own office space. Overall, research suggests the open office floor plans, a central tenant of coworking spaces, hinder productivity.

Space to Grow

You have room to grow if you lease your own space. Coworking offers flexibility, but constantly moving will be distracting to your team. And many shared workspaces have limits on how big the companies using their space can be, so you will eventually have to move out.

If you're looking for a new space anyway, it can be time and cost-efficient to find one with room to grow at the beginning.

Sublease Extra Space

You can make money by subleasing extra office space, especially if you rent a space large enough for your team to grow. We've even heard stories of recouping nearly all of your office expenses.

Reflect Your Brand and Culture

Modern office design is both functional and brings your brand to life. You can customize your own office to match your brand and company culture . At shared workspaces, you don't have any control over the layout of the office or the decorations, but in your own space, you can create an atmosphere that's most conducive to your company's success. Not only does this help employees think about your company's mission is also differentiates you from the competition when you are hiring employees .

Take, for example, the decision of Charlie Thuillier, CEO at Opto Ice Cream. Of his recent decision to move into a private workspace, Charlie said ""we have spent a huge amount of time investing in our culture and employee wellbeing. Coworking spaces are great but we wouldn’t want to risk diluting our culture as we scaled"".

Summary

There are a lot of factors to consider when finding a new home for your growing company. Both shared workspaces and your own lease have their advantages. And each company has its own set of circumstances.

When you evaluate the comparison above, customize them to your company. At what stages of their careers are your team? Are you seeking social and learning opportunities or focus on your core values? What is your employee growth plan?",considering new office space
265,Six Change Management Tips For Your Office Relocation,https://www.tmsconsulting.com.au/blog/six-change-management-tips-for-your-office-relocation/,,"While an office relocation can be an exciting and positive time for an organisation – potentially signalling growth, success or a new era for the business – it is also a period of major change that requires the utmost care.

The way an organisation manages and communicates this process with its staff will ultimately determine whether your workforce hits the ground running in the new environment or sits spinning its wheels on arrival.

In this blog, I’d like to share with you six key things to keep in mind to ensure your office relocation is the success it should be.

1. Plan

Plan for people as well as physical aspects

Whilst your physical move (IT and phone systems, desks, chairs, equipment etc.) is probably under the management of an experienced Project Manager, there are also more subtle elements that also need to be considered and planned for.

The often overlooked elements come from the people-side ; the impact on people themselves, as well as the impact of the relocation on an organisation’s culture and climate.

Staff will often have undocumented patterns, or practices, that cross team and department boundaries and when disturbed, can have subtle impacts on an organisation’s climate. This could be as simple as the morning walk to get a coffee with other team members, to the regular, informal lunch arrangements across teams that keeps the inter-team relationships friendly and helpful. Or it can be as unsettling as inter-departmental meetings, which may now be more challenging to organise when the teams are in different buildings, or cities.

Plan to identify and consult with all your stakeholders, not only the people relocating, but also colleagues, associations, unions, and any other relevant groups. Consider how these stakeholders could input into the design, or layout, of the new space.

Engagement and consultation with all stakeholders will ensure that everyone affected by the change is provided with opportunities to offer information, participate in decision making, ask questions, share their knowledge and skills, and ultimately commit to change

2. Communicate, Communicate, Communicate

Ensure your Communications Plan is aligned with your Project Plan

Keep your staff regularly informed with updates

Face-to-face communication is key

The staff who are impacted by the relocation can easily feel that they don’t know what’s about to happen to them and this can bring on varying levels of stress. If you don’t communicate and engage, informal processes will fill the void, sometimes with negative consequences.

The Communications Plan is pivotal to the success of keeping your staff informed, and therefore of your relocation. Ensure that your Communications Plan works closely with your main Project Plan, perhaps even integrating major events into the Plan.

Always keep in mind the clear and consistent messaging that you will be delivering to staff. Make sure that you can clearly define the purpose of the relocation, including why the change needs to occur and the benefits. Remember that staff don’t necessarily have the background knowledge that the relocation team has, especially as to why certain activities will be taking place in the sequence that they are.

Additionally as frustrating as it may seem to the Relocation team, it can take between 3 to 5 times for a message to be finally “taken on board”; don’t assume that just because you have sent a communication that your message has been received.

Use multiple communication channels such as face-to-face, email, intranet and even social media to reach as many people as possible – each channel should focus on a slightly different facet, or audience. Keep in mind, people pay attention to people, so engaging in face-to-face and verbal communication will be key to getting your message across . Email is useful and timely, but emails are often missed in the volume that many people receive. A disappointing, but not surprising, comment that I have heard is “Oh, I didn’t bother to read that. If it was really important, someone would let me know!”

3. Use “Move Champs” or Change Champions

Engage and consult with Champions early and often

Successful relocations, like other change projects, involve people as early as possible. Starting with the Executive Sponsor, seek engagement from representatives throughout the organisation.

It is not always easy to overcome the negative emotions around change so utilise members of staff who are already engaged and positive about the change to help get the rest of the team on board.

‘Change Champions’, or ‘Move Champs’ in this case, can be your eyes and ears on the ground. They can help their teams prepare for the move, meeting regularly to convey information in both directions.

4. Listen

Ensure communication is two-way – listen to concerns and act on them

Relocating, whether it be to the next street, suburb or state, can be quite emotionally unsettling for people. It’s important to listen to people’s concerns; though they might seem trivial compared to some of the larger issues, they are important to the individuals concerned.

Use the face-to-face opportunities, such as large “town hall” sessions , medium-sized staff forums, and individual one-on-one sessions, to ensure that people feel that you are sincerely listening.

If there are times where there are questions that you can’t answer, be frank about that. Once you are able to answer the questions, communicate the answers through the appropriate channels.

Engaging early can help identify critical accommodation issues, such as change rooms, and impacts on changes to doing business e.g. hot-desking. Good communication (and engagement) helps project teams understand, anticipate and respond to staff concerns.

5. Manage expectations

Be understanding, but realistic, about expectations for the move

Staff may have differing expectations about the move and what their new environment will be like. If possible, take your Move Champs on guided tours of the new location, as soon as practical.

If your relocation is across a significant distance, there might be some staff who have to decide whether they have to resign from their positions. This causes stress for not only the individuals concerned (and their families), but also the team that they will be leaving.

Staff who have been located for a long period of time in one location could encounter ‘place attachment’, or an emotional tie to a place. This break from a location can be felt quite strongly, and is quite different to the attachment to a beautiful setting, or building. Acknowledging this feeling of loss, or nostalgia, for the old site can help individuals start to deal with the loss. You might also consider holding departing ceremonies at the time of the move, so there is a clear marker of the move from old to new location. Depending on the significance of the old location, you could also memorialise the old site with photos, or artefacts.

Also, do you need to keep the services that you provide seamlessly in place?

Staff may be expected to maintain a high degree of customer service whilst also encountering the stress that a relocation will place on them, often with no additional resources. This in turn can have a negative impact on morale . A Business Continuity Plan can help you address these potential risks.

6. Change management after the move

Keep support available after the relocation

You’ve successfully moved – does that mean that it’s all done? Not surprisingly, with such a large scale effort, there still will be issues to iron out.

How will the organisation use technology to bridge the new, geographical challenges e.g. use of Skype for Business to facilitate video conferences? You might need to run additional training sessions, once staff have arrived at their new locations. Other pressures can be encountered in the use of what are now shared resources, such as limited conference rooms with video capabilities.

Your Move Champs can help smooth out some of these, but it is important to continue to listen to people. Some of the issues will be physical, but it is important that people continue to feel that their feedback is being considered.

In closing, celebrate the successful move to the new site with a welcome event, marking the transition for staff and stakeholders who will use the space. Continue the communication and engagement with the stakeholders, and make sure that the “lessons learned” are captured.",plans to move office

176,Slidell Police Department receives approval to relocate ...,https://wgno.com/news/louisiana/st-tammany-parish/slidell-police-department-receives-approval-to-relocate-headquarters/,2 дня назад,"SLIDELL, La. (WGNO) — The Slidell Police Department is getting a new home and is moving out of its current Olde Towne headquarters. The department is relocating to a brand-new facility built on city-owned land off Robert Boulevard.

Chief Administrative Officer Daniel Seuzeneau explains the move is overdue, especially now that hurricane season is here.

“When a storm comes and it floods, the building may not flood but everything underneath all of our vehicles and everything would have to move,” said Seuzeneau.

Initially, the department planned to upgrade its current headquarters. Yet, the $23 million cost of renovations was $8 million over the department’s budget.

Seuzeneau says it will only cost $15 million to build a new state-of-the-art headquarters, a plan that saves both time and money.

“In the process of building a new facility, we don’t have to move out of here. Because that is quite a logistical nightmare to have to move everything here. We have five decades’ worth of evidence back here we are going to have to deal with,” said Seuzeneau.

The department isn’t completely leaving its Olde Towne roots. Seuzeneau says the department plans to maintain a substation in the historic area.

Slidell resident David Ticer says he’s happy with the plan to build a new headquarters.

“That makes me feel good because we need our police. We need our police, especially during disasters, because if you don’t have police, you end up with violence,” said Ticer.

The funds for the new facility are expected to be in place by the end of the year, with construction set to begin in early 2025.

“They say it could take a year in a half, two years, to three years depending upon the weather and other circumstances. So, we are hoping to be in the new facility by 2027,” said Seuzeneau.

65,Strategic Equity and Anti-Racism Framework,https://equity.ubc.ca/stear-framework-and-roadmap-for-change/,,"Endorsed by UBC’s leadership, the Strategic Equity and Anti-Racism (StEAR) Framework guides the university’s approach to implementation of equity and anti-racism priorities and evaluation of progress.

Context

Introduced in 2023 by the Associate Vice-President, Equity and Inclusion (AVPEI), the StEAR Framework is a community-engaged, data-informed, action-oriented and accountability-driven planning tool developed to guide the implementation of equity and anti-racism priorities and the cyclical evaluation of progress over the next three to five years.

The framework is built around four broad institutional domains of change – structural, curricular, compositional and interactional – and six principles of practice. Using the framework, the Equity & Inclusion Office (EIO) reviewed UBC’s existing equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI)-related plans and reports to identify salient objectives and strategic actions that constitute the StEAR Roadmap for Change.

A StEAR governance model provides an accountability structure and establishes lines of communication, consultation, and engagement with Equity Leads, EDI champions, and HPSM community groups.

Additionally, efforts will be made to build the competencies and capacities of leaders to act as change agents, to develop reporting and accountability mechanisms, and to establish quantitative and qualitative measures and methods to track progress.

Relationship with the Indigenous Strategic Plan The Indigenous Strategic Plan (ISP) Guiding Network is responsible for facilitating the implementation of the ISP, which “provides thoughtful guidance for action and a framework for reconciliation”. The StEAR framework is meant to complement, not compete with, the ISP, which is the university’s organizing framework to advance priorities related to Indigenous rights, decolonization, and reconciliation. In collaboration with Indigenous leads, mutually beneficial mechanisms for communication, consultation, collaboration, and coalition-building across the StEAR and ISP frameworks will be in place to ensure that equity and anti-racism priorities relevant to Indigenous students, faculty, and staff are appropriately addressed and/or referred to in the StEAR framework.

Domains of change and goals Structural change: to develop institutional principles, paradigms, and processes that build organizational capacity to enable, drive, and sustain systems change through equitable and anti-racist leadership, governance, and accountability. Curricular change: to promote locally and globally relevant and responsive ways of learning, knowing, and translating knowledge through equitable and anti-racist teaching, research, and community-engagement programs and pedagogies. Compositional change: to expand the representational diversity of the student body, professoriate, staff complement, and senior leadership and enhance lifecycle experiences of historically, persistently and systemically marginalized (HPSM) groups through equitable and anti-racist recruitment, development, and retention policies and practice. Interactional change: to develop individual proficiencies that build campus community capacity to foster positive and effective intergroup relations and cultivate a climate that promotes human rights, dignity, equality, and belonging through equity and anti-racism training, education, and dialogue.

Guiding principles 1. Recognition of the rights of Indigenous Peoples and respect for self-determination: implementing equity and anti-racism plans in a manner that complements and elevates, but does not subsume, Indigenous-led plans; 2. Race-consciousness in the pursuit of equity and inclusive excellence: centering anti-racism in an intersectional anti-oppressive framework to address deeply imbedded institutional racism and systemic inequities; 3. Meaningful and ethical community engagement: ensuring ongoing consultation with, transparent communication to, and meaningful recognition of contributions of historically, persistently, or systemically marginalized groups; 4. Networked leadership and coordinated de-centralization: cultivating a collaborative network of cross-campus equity champions working in communities of practice to advance unit-level and university priorities; 5. Accountability through collective responsibility and leadership ownership: demonstrating senior-level endorsement of and investment in strategic initiatives to mobilize and sustain campus-wide ownership and action towards systems change; 6. Data-informed decision-making and continuous improvement: undertaking assessment, evaluation, and research and leveraging qualitative and quantitative data to inform cyclical strategic planning processes.

Roadmap for change: Objectives and strategic actions

The StEAR Roadmap for Change sets out 18 salient objectives and numerous strategic actions as part of the StEAR framework, to be implemented over the next three to five years.

As a living document, the roadmap will be updated to reflect new plans and reports as well as signal progress on strategic actions. Implementation sponsors, leads, and partners have been identified for each strategic action, and will be included in subsequent versions of the roadmap.

Explore the objectives and strategic actions for each of the domains of change below or review it as a PDF.

Compositional change Explore objectives and actions intended to expand recruitment, development and retention of historically, persistently or systemically marginalized groups. Learn more Interactional change Explore objectives and actions intended to develop individual proficiencies through equity and anti-racism training, education and dialogue. Learn more

Governance model

To support the implementation of the roadmap, a governance model provides an accountability structure: Implementation Teams to drive efforts, a StEAR Roadmap Implementation Committee comprising the leads of Implementation Teams; the committee reports to the Executive Liaison Team comprising Executive Sponsors.

The model also establishes lines of communication for consultation and engagement of Equity Leads, EDI champions and campus community groups representing historically, persistently or systemically marginalized (HPSM) students, faculty and staff.

Implementation accountabilities

This section details the accountabilities for the implementation of the roadmap.

The Associate Vice-President, Equity and Inclusion and the EIO The Associate Vice-President, Equity and Inclusion (AVPEI) and the EIO team will be responsible for centrally leading the planning and evaluation of the roadmap implementation. The AVPEI will chair a StEAR Roadmap Implementation Committee that will provide a forum for Implementation Team leads to share progress on strategic actions, which will be reported to the Executive Liaison Team and the campus community. The AVPEI and the EIO team will also be responsible for establishing and coordinating networks with HPSM students, faculty and staff and communities of practice with Faculty and portfolio Equity Leads as well as unit champions and facilitating lines of communication, consultation and collaboration through implementation.

UBC Executive (Senior-level sponsors) The UBC Executive will be responsible for clearly articulating commitments to deploying the StEAR framework, including the roadmap, imbedding principles and practices in executive portfolio strategies, and investing appropriate human and financial resources to support and sustain pan-institutional implementation. StEAR Executive Liaison Team The StEAR Executive Liaison Team includes the AVPEI, the UBCV and UBCO Provosts & Vice Presidents, Academic, the Vice-President, Students, the Vice-President, Human Resources, the UBCO Associate Provost, Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Anti-racism (IDEA) and the Executive Director and Project Manager from the Office of the President. The committee meets monthly to review progress on implementation, to elevate information to the Executive, and to recommend executive level actions and communications to support campus-wide mobilization of efforts.

Senior leadership (Key campus partners) Senior academic and administrative leaders will be responsible for directing human and financial resources to support implementation, including developing the cadre of Faculty and portfolio Equity Leads and building capacity for Faculty and portfolio-level systems change. Implementation Teams StEAR Implementation Teams will be established where mobilizing objectives requires cross-unit/campus partnership and deployment of EIO project managers. Leads and team members will be identified on the basis of positional responsibilities and subject matter expertise. Each team will develop a project plan and will be supported by an EIO assigned project manager.

Lines of communication for community consultation and engagement

This section defines mechanisms for communication, consultation and engagement with Equity Leads, EDI champions and HPSM community groups.

Faculty and portfolio Equity Leads (Distributed equity champions) Faculty and portfolio Equity Leads are designated by their Dean or VP to participate in an EIO-facilitated equity and anti-racism community of practice and to mobilize and support initiatives at the faculty/portfolio level. Departmental-level EDI Action Network The EDI Action Network is a community of practice established for department-level EDI champions (for example, typically faculty and staff who chair or participate on unit EDI committees). EIO team members will facilitate regular meetings with the EDI Action Network.

Historically, persistently or systemically marginalized (HPSM) groups The StEAR Framework explicitly draws from, and brings together, the incredible work done by various historically, persistently, or systemically marginalized communities through the plans and reports they have produced, and these perspectives were integral to its development. The EIO is taking an inventory of affinity and advocacy groups on campus and establishing processes for building relationships and enhancing communication. Mechanisms will be introduced to ensure intentional and regular consultation and engagement of HPSM groups throughout the StEAR framework implementation.

695,Strategy,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy,,"Plan to achieve goals in uncertainty

Strategy (from Greek στρατηγία stratēgia, ""art of troop leader; office of general, command, generalship""[1]) is a general plan to achieve one or more long-term or overall goals under conditions of uncertainty.[2] In the sense of the ""art of the general"", which included several subsets of skills including military tactics, siegecraft, logistics etc., the term came into use in the 6th century C.E. in Eastern Roman terminology, and was translated into Western vernacular languages only in the 18th century. From then until the 20th century, the word ""strategy"" came to denote ""a comprehensive way to try to pursue political ends, including the threat or actual use of force, in a dialectic of wills"" in a military conflict, in which both adversaries interact.[3]

Strategy is important because the resources available to achieve goals are usually limited. Strategy generally involves setting goals and priorities, determining actions to achieve the goals, and mobilizing resources to execute the actions.[4] A strategy describes how the ends (goals) will be achieved by the means (resources).[5] Strategy can be intended or can emerge as a pattern of activity as the organization adapts to its environment or competes.[4] It involves activities such as strategic planning and strategic thinking.[6]

Henry Mintzberg from McGill University defined strategy as a pattern in a stream of decisions to contrast with a view of strategy as planning,[7] while Henrik von Scheel defines the essence of strategy as the activities to deliver a unique mix of value – choosing to perform activities differently or to perform different activities than rivals.[8] while Max McKeown (2011) argues that ""strategy is about shaping the future"" and is the human attempt to get to ""desirable ends with available means"". Vladimir Kvint defines strategy as ""a system of finding, formulating, and developing a doctrine that will ensure long-term success if followed faithfully.""[9]

Military theory [ edit ]

Subordinating the political point of view to the military would be absurd, for it is policy that has created war...Policy is the guiding intelligence, and war only the instrument, not vice-versa. On War by Carl von Clausewitz

In military theory, strategy is ""the utilization during both peace and war, of all of the nation's forces, through large scale, long-range planning and development, to ensure security and victory"" (Random House Dictionary).[7]

The father of Western modern strategic study, Carl von Clausewitz, defined military strategy as ""the employment of battles to gain the end of war."" B. H. Liddell Hart's definition put less emphasis on battles, defining strategy as ""the art of distributing and applying military means to fulfill the ends of policy"".[10] Hence, both gave the pre-eminence to political aims over military goals. U.S. Naval War College instructor Andrew Wilson defined strategy as the ""process by which political purpose is translated into military action.""[11] Lawrence Freedman defined strategy as the ""art of creating power.""[12]

Eastern military philosophy dates back much further, with examples such as The Art of War by Sun Tzu dated around 500 B.C.[13]

Counterterrorism Strategy [ edit ]

Because counterterrorism involves the synchronized efforts of numerous competing bureaucratic entities, national governments frequently create overarching counterterrorism strategies at the national level.[14] A national counterterrorism strategy is a government's plan to use the instruments of national power to neutralize terrorists, their organizations, and their networks in order to render them incapable of using violence to instill fear and to coerce the government or its citizens to react in accordance with the terrorists' goals.[14] The United States has had several such strategies in the past, including the United States National Strategy for Counterterrorism (2018);[15] the Obama-era National Strategy for Counterterrorism (2011); and the National Strategy for Combatting Terrorism (2003). There have also been a number of ancillary or supporting plans, such as the 2014 Strategy to Counter the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, and the 2016 Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States.[14] Similarly, the United Kingdom's counterterrorism strategy, CONTEST, seeks ""to reduce the risk to the UK and its citizens and interests overseas from terrorism, so that people can go about their lives freely and with confidence.""[16]

Management theory [ edit ]

The essence of formulating competitive strategy is relating a company to its environment. Michael Porter[17]

Modern business strategy emerged as a field of study and practice in the 1960s; prior to that time, the words ""strategy"" and ""competition"" rarely appeared in the most prominent management literature.[18][19] Alfred Chandler wrote in 1962 that: ""Strategy is the determination of the basic long-term goals of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals.""[20] Michael Porter defined strategy in 1980 as the ""...broad formula for how a business is going to compete, what its goals should be, and what policies will be needed to carry out those goals"" and the ""...combination of the ends (goals) for which the firm is striving and the means (policies) by which it is seeking to get there.""[17]

Definition [ edit ]

Henry Mintzberg described five definitions of strategy in 1998:

Strategy as plan – a directed course of action to achieve an intended set of goals; similar to the strategic planning concept;

set of goals; similar to the strategic planning concept; Strategy as pattern – a consistent pattern of past behavior, with a strategy realized over time rather than planned or intended . Where the realized pattern was different from the intent, he referred to the strategy as emergent ;

over time rather than planned or . Where the realized pattern was different from the intent, he referred to the strategy as ; Strategy as position – locating brands, products, or companies within the market, based on the conceptual framework of consumers or other stakeholders; a strategy determined primarily by factors outside the firm;

Strategy as ploy – a specific maneuver intended to outwit a competitor; and

Strategy as perspective – executing strategy based on a ""theory of the business"" or natural extension of the mindset or ideological perspective of the organization.[21]

Complexity theorists define strategy as the unfolding of the internal and external aspects of the organization that results in actions in a socio-economic context.[22][23][24]

Strategic Problem [ edit ]

The concept of strategic problem elucidates the dynamic interplay between competitive warfare and harmonious cooperation among agents within fluctuating markets. Crouch delves into this domain, emphasizing the sustenance of dynamic relationships. While embracing the notion of cooperation, the author accentuates the primacy of market structure preceding strategy, in turn preceding organizational structure. Hence, the author's perspectives align closely with definitions that regard strategy as a valuable position, as articulated by Porter and Mintzberg.[25][26][27]

In contrast, Burnett adopt a prescriptive viewpoint, defining strategy as a plan formulated through methodology. According to Burnett, the strategic problem encompasses six tasks: goal formulation, environmental analysis, strategy formulation, strategy evaluation, strategy implementation, and strategic control.[28]

Mukherji and Hurtado indicates a bifurcation in defining the strategic problem. The literature commonly highlights two aspects: the challenge of categorizing the environment and emphasizing the organization's primary responses to the established context. These aspects, as identified by the authors, encapsulate the three dimensions originally proposed by Ansoff and Hayes, which evolved to encompass internal and external issues arising from the situation, the processes involved in resolving these issues, and their constituting variables.[29]

From a complexity perspective, the strategic problem intertwines invariably with governance within complex, interconnected systems, both internally and within the external milieu. In Terra and Passador's conceptualization, the strategic problem is rooted in the interrelations among subsystems, human agents, and environmental elements within organizations seen as complex sociotechnical systems consisting of symbiotic relationships among subsystems, originating from the configurations of the organization's internal social system and the responses it generates to ensure its own identity. This model accentuates the intricate nature of these interconnections, highlighting the challenge for strategists to comprehend and navigate the complex interactions between internal structures and external responses.[30][23]

Complexity Theory [ edit ]

Complexity science, as articulated by R. D. Stacey, represents a conceptual framework capable of harmonizing emergent and deliberate strategies. Within complexity approaches, the term ""strategy"" is intricately linked to action but contrasts programmed action. Complexity theorists view programs merely as predetermined sequences effective in highly ordered and less chaotic environments. Conversely, strategy emerges from a simultaneous examination of determined conditions (order) and uncertainties (disorder) that drive action. Complexity theory posits that strategy involves execution, encompasses control and emergence, scrutinizes both internal and external organizational aspects, and can take the form of maneuvers or any other act or process.[31][23][30]

The works of Stacey stand as pioneering efforts in applying complexity principles to the field of strategy. This author applied self-organization and chaos principles to describe strategy, organizational change dynamics, and learning. Their propositions advocate for strategy approached through choices and the evolutionary process of competitive selection. In this context, corrections of anomalies occur through actions involving negative feedback, while innovation and continuous change stem from actions guided by positive feedback.[32][31][33]

Dynamically, complexity in strategic management can be elucidated through the model of ""Symbiotic Dynamics"" by Terra and Passador.[23][34] This model conceives the social organization of production as an interplay between two distinct systems existing in a symbiotic relationship while interconnected with the external environment. The organization's social network acts as a self-referential entity controlling the organization's life, while its technical structure resembles a purposeful ""machine"" supplying the social system by processing resources. These intertwined structures exchange disturbances and residues while interacting with the external world through their openness. Essentially, as the organization produces itself, it also hetero-produces, surviving through energy and resource flows across its subsystems.[23][34]

This dynamic has strategic implications, governing organizational dynamics through a set of attraction basins establishing operational and regenerative capabilities. Hence, one of the primary roles of strategists is to identify ""human attractors"" and assess their impacts on organizational dynamics. According to the theory of Symbiotic Dynamics, both leaders and the technical system can act as attractors, directly influencing organizational dynamics and responses to external disruptions. Terra and Passador further assert that while producing, organizations contribute to environmental entropy, potentially leading to abrupt ruptures and collapses within their subsystems, even within the organizations themselves. Given this issue, the authors conclude that organizations intervening to maintain the environment's stability within suitable parameters for survival tend to exhibit greater longevity.[23][34]

The theory of Symbiotic Dynamics posits that organizations must acknowledge their impact on the external environment (markets, society, and the environment) and act systematically to reduce their degradation while adapting to the demands arising from these interactions. To achieve this, organizations need to incorporate all interconnected systems into their decision-making processes, enabling the envisioning of complex socio-economic systems where they integrate in a stable and sustainable manner. This blend of proactivity and reactivity is fundamental to ensure the survival of the organization itself. [23]

Components [ edit ]

Professor Richard P. Rumelt described strategy as a type of problem solving in 2011. He wrote that good strategy has an underlying structure he called a kernel. The kernel has three parts: 1) A diagnosis that defines or explains the nature of the challenge; 2) A guiding policy for dealing with the challenge; and 3) Coherent actions designed to carry out the guiding policy.[35] President Kennedy illustrated these three elements of strategy in his Cuban Missile Crisis Address to the Nation of 22 October 1962:

Diagnosis: ""This Government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military buildup on the island of Cuba. Within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites are now in preparation on that imprisoned island. The purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere."" Guiding Policy: ""Our unswerving objective, therefore, must be to prevent the use of these missiles against this or any other country, and to secure their withdrawal or elimination from the Western Hemisphere."" Action Plans: First among seven numbered steps was the following: ""To halt this offensive buildup a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated. All ships of any kind bound for Cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back.""[36]

Rumelt wrote in 2011 that three important aspects of strategy include ""premeditation, the anticipation of others' behavior, and the purposeful design of coordinated actions."" He described strategy as solving a design problem, with trade-offs among various elements that must be arranged, adjusted and coordinated, rather than a plan or choice.[35]

Formulation and implementation [ edit ]

Strategy typically involves two major processes: formulation and implementation. Formulation involves analyzing the environment or situation, making a diagnosis, and developing guiding policies. It includes such activities as strategic planning and strategic thinking. Implementation refers to the action plans taken to achieve the goals established by the guiding policy.[6][35]

Bruce Henderson wrote in 1981 that: ""Strategy depends upon the ability to foresee future consequences of present initiatives."" He wrote that the basic requirements for strategy development include, among other factors: 1) extensive knowledge about the environment, market and competitors; 2) ability to examine this knowledge as an interactive dynamic system; and 3) the imagination and logic to choose between specific alternatives. Henderson wrote that strategy was valuable because of: ""finite resources, uncertainty about an adversary's capability and intentions; the irreversible commitment of resources; necessity of coordinating action over time and distance; uncertainty about control of the initiative; and the nature of adversaries' mutual perceptions of each other.""[37]

Game theory [ edit ]

In game theory, a player's strategy is any of the options that the player would choose in a specific setting. Any optimal outcomes they receive depend not only on their actions but also, the actions of other players.[38]

Dana Baldwin

Senior Consultant, CSSP, Inc.

In strategic planning, there are five basic strategies one may pursue: Expand, Maintain, Contract, Milk or Withdraw. The most aggressive strategy is Expand. What does an Expand strategy encompass?

First, let's define the Expand strategy so we have a basis on which to base discussion. The dictionary defines expand as: to increase the extent, number, volume, or scope of, to enlarge. We further define an expand strategy as one in which we are growing significantly faster than the market or market segment is growing overall.

To follow an expand strategy, a company must decide to provide the resources which will support the targeted growth rate. It implies that the company's growth will absorb much of the real growth of the markets in which the company is competing. It also implies that the company is willing to take on competitors in order to take market share from them, in addition to absorbing the growth in the market place itself.

Before we select the expand strategy, we need to look in depth at each market segment to see whether it will qualify for an expand strategy. What are the requirements that a market segment should have in order to be eligible for an expand strategy?

First, we need to be able to have sufficient resources, both people and money, to properly support the strategy to expand our sales volume in each affected market segment. An expansion strategy can be quite expensive, and will likely absorb a lot of time of some key people in your company.

Second, it should be in a relatively attractive market. We use a 3 x 3 matrix to demonstrate how attractive a market segment is, and also how strong a competitor we are relative to our own competition.

When you look at the matrix above, you can readily see that the market attractiveness for the suggested strategy of expand is high. Notice too, that the competitive strength (vertical axis) may range from being a weak competitor/new entry to being a strong, dominant competitor. Our goal over time is to move our competitive position up the axis to the strongest possible competitive position.

Often it won't make a lot of sense to expand in a less attractive market segment. The one exception for this is in a moderately attractive market in which you are the dominant player. If the potential for a good long term reward is present in a moderately attractive segment where you are a strong number one, then expand should certainly be considered.

Many companies simply do not have the depth of resources - usually people resources - to support too many expand strategies. Companies need to select the few markets where they want to expend the resources to significantly gain market share. Focusing resources is paramount to any plan's success - so your team should not try to expand in all markets. Rather, we suggest pick the 2-3 that, given the effort, will deliver the most bang for your buck. We find that if you force the team to pick only 2-3 expand strategies immediately, a few ""winners"" will be chosen. This selection of only a few ""expands"" helps ensure that a team will be successful on the chosen markets.

In conclusion, an expand strategy is a strong bet on your company's ability to grab market share at a rate higher than the market is expanding, with the goal of increasing your return on investment over time. This means you will aim to increase your top line sales and bottom line profits at a rate higher than the additional costs you will be incurring in your expansion efforts.

A recent survey of more than 16,000 full-time office workers across 15 countries showed that office designs are not keeping pace with the evolving needs of the workforce.

According to Gensler, the world’s biggest architecture and design firm, there is a direct positive link between top performers and working in a high-quality workplace.

The Gensler Workplace Survey, which was conducted between Oct 31, 2023, and Jan 29, 2024, involved respondents of various ages in a range of roles and geographies, including the United States, Britain and South-east Asia. Respondents excluded full-time remote workers.

It found that workers in higher-quality spaces reported more positive feelings about their company.

The report highlighted the importance of going beyond building efficiency, or the effective design of spaces, in defining workplace performance.

The emotional response to space, also called the “workplace experience”, is a recent finding that indicates a significant shift towards a more people-centric approach to workplace performance.

The survey showed that those born between 1997 and 2010, also known as Gen Z, look for places such as cafes, outdoor workspaces and libraries.

Meanwhile, top performers want variety in their workplaces, with opportunities for learning, networking and socialising.

The company envisions a pair of buildings off Col. Glenn Highway near Interstate 675, not far from the Dave Dennis Chrysler Jeep Dodge auto dealership at 4232 Col Glenn Highway.

One planned building is bigger than the other, with a two-story, 40,000-square-foot office building being finalized in design, and a four-story, 85,000-square-foot building for which design is already finalized. Grading work at the construction site has started.

Synergy will likely break ground this spring. Plans will be forwarded to Beavercreek city planners next month.

For years, Synergy and Mills has spearheaded projects serving area defense contractors and others. The company created a Department of Defense-focused corridor off I-675 with clients such as Kettering Health Network, Wright State University and the Department of Veterans Affairs. The company was also behind other commercial projects in recent years, serving Dayton Children’s Hospital Child Health Pavilion, to Allure apartments in Centerville.

When it comes to building for the local defense community, Synergy is familiar with the market.

“Our expectation is that not only Wright-Patterson Air Force Base and the jobs on base, but especially the contract support outside the base will continue to grow,” Barnett said in an interview.

Wright-Patterson is unique in that it is the largest concentration of employment in one location in the state of Ohio, but some 35,000 military, civilian and contractor employees working on or for the base.

231,Ten golden rules for leasing your first office space,https://www.startupdonut.co.uk/business-premises/commercial-premises/ten-golden-rules-for-leasing-your-first-office-space,,"Whether you're thinking of making the move from a home office to a leased office or you are establishing your business in a commercial environment, renting office space is a big decision – and one that requires careful thought and forward planning

The good news is finding your first office space is usually a sign that your start-up is beginning to expand and flourish, and means that you're ready to take the plunge and find a more productive environment from which to run your business. But there are both monetary and strategic issues to take into account, and these ten golden rules will raise important issues for you to consider before leasing your first office space:

1 Make sure you're in a position to commit

Leasing office space means committing to a commercial office lease - and this is a legally binding agreement that will tie you in to a contract for a given period. You must ask yourself whether the move to leased office space will enhance your business and the services you offer, and that it will enable you to be a more profitable and productive business. An office lease is a big responsibility to take on and as a small business you need to make sure you are clear about the commitment and at the right stage to move on to a “real” office.

2 Ask yourself – can I afford commercial premises?

It goes without saying that a new office will tie you to regular monthly costs that you may not have had to consider until now. These will include rent, service charges, business rates, maintenance costs, insurance and the day-to-day running costs. Make sure you are fully aware of all the costs from the outset and that you don't overstretch yourself financially.

3 Don't try to do it yourself!

Finding the right office and then negotiating the right terms for your business is a time-consuming and complex process, so you should never attempt to take this on yourself. Use a commercial property agent in your area who knows the market inside out and can “hold your hand” throughout the process to ensure a profitable outcome for your business.

4 Make sure the lease is on your terms

Every office lease is different, yet they are usually drafted in favour of the landlord. Decide what office lease terms are best for you as a tenant; consider issues such as lease length, rental increases, options to renew, break clauses, etc. Clarifying these issues at an early stage will save lots of upheaval at the negotiation stage.

5 Short list potential premises

Do your homework on your shortlisted properties; tour the building several times; investigate who the landlord is and other properties they own, traffic patterns, who the previous tenant was (and why they left) and who the neighbouring tenants are.

6 Evaluate the building

Evaluate whether the geographical location, space and type of building is a good fit for your business. Your choice of office space says a lot about you as a business and you want to make sure it gives the right first impression. Use our office space checklist as a guide to evaluate each office building.

7 Consider your future growth

Make sure that any space you’re considering is big enough for both your current needs and your foreseeable growth. Be realistic and don’t under- or over-estimate your true needs.

8 Get professional legal advice

Hire a property solicitor who not only specialises in lease negotiations, but who also has dealt with start-ups before. A lease negotiation can cover hundreds of terms, often with confusing jargon, and you want someone who will represent your best interests and clarifies anything you don't understand.

9 Take advantage of the opportunity

Moving into leased office space provides you with a great opportunity to find the right office suppliers and install the right business communications systems that will enable you to operate efficiently and provide the best service to clients.

10 Don't rush into anything

Don't be rushed into making a decision if you're not fully comfortable. And if the lease negotiations don't quite come out as you planned – be prepared to walk away. There are always other properties that may better suit your needs.

The 10 Best Things to Know

Before Opening Your Own Office See also: Project Management Skills

Digital platforms, social media marketing programs and shopping applications make starting businesses simple and stress-free. Individuals can use virtual systems to build their companies’ foundations. Over time, businesses may expand and require office spaces or storefronts.

Opening an office space may feel overwhelming and anxiety-provoking. Business owners may expand their education to increase their projects’ success. There are ten things company owners should explore before opening office spaces.

Employees are Returning to Office Spaces

Preparing business owners for office space development is essential. More employees are willing to return to the office as the pandemic’s intensity decreases. Employees believe office spaces improve collaboration, decision making and social connections.

One company found up to 80% of its employees would like to return to the office. C.E.O.s are developing inviting and productive offices to support their employees following the lockdown. Business owners can explore office space expansions or development to ensure a project’s success.

1. Know Your Needs

Owners should understand their needs before purchasing a new office space. They may identify precisely why they need a physical space for employees. Business owners can also determine the features their offices need.

Some CEOs search for larger office spaces to protect their employees’ health and well-being. They look for spaces large enough for social distancing and small enough to maintain cleanliness. Employees can contract germs and viruses through shared surfaces like keyboards and door handles.

Large office spaces reduce individuals’ interactions with shared surfaces. Business owners may also install efficient ventilation systems and hire routine cleaners to maintain cleanliness. Individuals may also define their budgets when defining their needs.

2. Location is Essential

The second area of consideration is location. Business owners may choose office space locations based on where their employees live. They also can consider their core customers’ demographics before purchasing office spaces.

Business owners may also explore the real estate market when investing in new offices. Real estate prices change depending on a building’s proximity to a city, highway, main road or an important structure. Finding the perfect location may take time and remaining optimistic may improve the process.

3. Lease or Purchase

Individuals may also decide whether to lease or purchase a building in the initial stages. Renting and buying offices have their advantages and disadvantages. Both options offer business flexibility, which benefits owners.

Purchasing a building increases an owner’s ability to renovate and change the space. Renting an office allows individuals to walk away from an incompatible property. Leasing and purchasing buildings also require different financial demands.

It is more expensive to purchase an office space, which makes it less accessible to some business owners. Renting a space requires few upfront costs but landlords can increase rent at any point. Business owners may assess the pros and cons of renting and purchasing before investing in an office space.

4. Consider Using a Commercial Real Estate Agent

Business owners may feel confused and overwhelmed when navigating the commercial real estate market. Some CEOs transitioning from remote work may be experiencing the market for the first time. Working with a commercial real estate agent can help business owners find affordable and compatible workspaces.

Agents also identify and resolve conflicts throughout the closing process. They may pick up on hidden costs and other contract-related issues to minimize financial losses. Business owners can find talented agents by exploring their credentials and previous experience.

5. Plan for Expansions

Individuals may also plan for business expansions when searching for office spaces. Most owners hope to expand their companies and reach a larger audience of consumers. Customers generally want their favorite businesses to grow also and create more storefronts.

Business owners may plan for expansion when looking for office spaces. They can purchase buildings with space for renovations. Or they may invest in short-term rental spaces and minimize expansion limitations.

6. Determine Your Moving Costs

Owners may also determine their moving costs before investing in an office space. Moving offices or designing first-time spaces can be expensive. Moving furniture, electronics, appliances and other materials requires professional services.

Individuals can determine their office set-up costs by contacting a professional mover. They may also calculate the number of hours interrupting the workday. Business owners may deduct profits from their moving time and calculate it into their costs.

7. Explore Hidden Fees

Business owners can make the most of their office space budgets by watching out for hidden fees. Some property owners hide damage to increase the cost of their buildings. Individuals may receive multiple inspections before purchasing office spaces to minimize repair or maintenance fees.

They can also avoid hidden fees by thoroughly reading rental agreements. Business owners may search for properties with set rental rates in their contracts to avoid unexpected changes. They may also determine monthly utility costs and what fees landlords include in rent.

Some landlords include monthly water costs and trash removal fees in rent. Others fail to identify who pays for additional fees. Finding a property owner who includes utility costs in their rental agreement may eliminate hidden costs.Â

8. Obtain Essential Furniture

CEOs may also consider what furniture items are essential to their new office spaces. Some individuals overspend on furniture, which takes away from their moving budget. Other business owners under-purchase goods and interfere with their employees’ work productivity.

The type of furniture business owners invest in can directly impact their employees’ health and well-being. Many CEOs add ergonomic chairs to their new office spaces because of their physical health benefits. The chair design promotes good posture, which influences alertness and engagement.

Some business owners also invest in adjustable standing desks to support their employees’ well-being. Standing up and moving throughout the day promotes good mental health. Individuals may also purchase multi-person office desks if businesses require group work and regular staff meetings.

Business owners may define their projected staff sizes for the coming years before investing in furniture. Filling new office spaces with the right amount of furniture can improve productivity and a company’s general success.

9. Help Employees Transition

Another consideration before opening an office space is employee transition training. Business owners can ensure the ease of their moves by designing relearning programs. Individuals may assess the adult learning principles before creating training courses.

The programs can include real-world applications to prepare employees for in-office work. Creating effective training programs may also help individuals transition away from remote work. The transition is challenging for some employees and requires additional support.

10. Switch Over Your Services

The last thing to consider when opening an office is services and utilities. If business owners move their office spaces, they must switch over their phone, electricity, water, WiFi and other services. Individuals can begin the transition by listing their monthly utilities.

Creating a list may help business owners cover all their bases. They may also update their google business accounts to include their new address.

Announce Your Move

Business owners can announce their moves after finding new properties and setting up their spaces. They may unveil their new office spaces to customers using social media, email campaigns and physical fliers. Individuals may collaborate with other business owners in their new neighborhoods to improve marketing.

Owners can also create accessible maps to help customers get to their new office spaces. Developing opening promotions may also attract customers and expand a business. After spreading the word about an opening, business owners can watch their profits increase.",plans to open new office

393,"The Bay of Pigs Invasion and its Aftermath, April 1961",https://history.state.gov/milestones/1961-1968/bay-of-pigs,,"The Bay of Pigs Invasion and its Aftermath, April 1961–October 1962

A left-wing revolution in Cuba had ended in 1959 with the ouster of President Fulgencio Batista and the establishment of a new government under Premier Fidel Castro. The Castro regime quickly severed the country’s formerly strong ties with the United States by expropriating U.S. economic assets in Cuba and developing close links with the Soviet Union.

These developments proved a source of grave concern to the United States given Cuba’s geographical proximity to the United States and brought Cuba into play as a new and significant factor in the Cold War. In March 1960, President Dwight D. Eisenhower directed the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) to develop a plan for the invasion of Cuba and overthrow of the Castro regime. The CIA organized an operation in which it trained and funded a force of exiled counter-revolutionary Cubans serving as the armed wing of the Democratic Revolutionary Front, known as Brigade 2506.

Following his election in November 1960, President John F. Kennedy learned of the invasion plan, concluded that Fidel Castro was a Soviet client posing a threat to all of Latin America and, after consultations with his advisors, gave his consent for the CIA-planned clandestine invasion of Cuba to proceed. Launched from Guatemala, the attack went wrong almost from the start. Components of Brigade 2506 landed at the Bay of Pigs on April 17, 1961 and were defeated within 2 days by Cuban armed forces under the direct command of Castro.

The failed invasion strengthened the position of Castro’s administration, which proceeded to openly proclaim its intention to adopt socialism and pursue closer ties with the Soviet Union. It also led to a reassessment of Cuba policy by the Kennedy administration. The President established a committee under former Army Chief of Staff General Maxwell Taylor and Attorney General Robert Kennedy to examine the causes of the defeat suffered at the Bay of Pigs.

This examination and policy assessment, initiated in May 1961, led in November of that year to a decision to implement a new covert program in Cuba, with the codename of Operation Mongoose. Oversight for Operation Mongoose was provided by the 5412/2 Special Group, under the auspices of the National Security Council, expanded to include General Taylor and Attorney General Kennedy.

Operation Mongoose was designed to do what the Bay of Pigs invasion failed to do: remove the Communist Castro regime from power in Cuba. Orchestrated by the CIA and Department of Defense under the direction of Edward Lansdale, Operation Mongoose constituted a multiplicity of plans with wide-ranging purpose and scope. Lansdale presented the Project’s six-phase schedule to Attorney General Kennedy on February 20, 1962, and President Kennedy received a briefing on the operation’s components on March 16, 1962. Lansdale outlined the coordinated program of political, psychological, military, sabotage, and intelligence operations, as well as proposed assassination attempts on key political leaders, including Castro. Monthly components of the operation were to be set in place to destabilize the communist regime, including the publication of Anti-Castro propaganda, provision of armaments for militant opposition groups, and establishment of guerilla bases throughout the country, all leading up to preparations for an October 1962 military intervention in Cuba. Some (though not all) of the planned Operation Mongoose actions were deployed during 1962, but the military intervention did not occur, and the Castro regime remained in power.

Although not considered as significant a U.S. foreign policy failure and embarrassment as the Bay of Pigs invasion, Operation Mongoose failed to achieve its most important goals. Meanwhile, throughout the spring and summer of 1962, U.S. intelligence reports indicated expanded arms shipments from the Soviet Union to Cuba. Amidst growing concern in Washington over whether the Soviet weapons being introduced into Cuba included ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads, in October 1962 the Kennedy administration suspended Operation Mongoose in the face of this far more serious threat—one that resulted in the most dangerous confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War.",intends to open new office
306,The Complete Guide For The Smoothest Office Move,https://www.bondcollective.com/blog/office-move,,"After you announce the move, gather your team to talk about the upcoming event face-to-face. Reiterate the details of the announcement, and then ask for input from your employees about their needs for — and concerns about — the new workspace.

Items might include:

Design recommendations (e.g., designate a quiet space)

Seating changes

Workspace needs (e.g., privacy screens, adjustable desks)

Equipment needs (e.g., upgrade printer/copier)

It is also beneficial to send out a survey after the face-to-face meeting to gather any personal preferences — seating changes or a team switch, for example — that your team members may not have felt comfortable expressing in a group setting.

6) Produce A Timeline For Your Office Move

Before you make any plans, produce a timeline for your office move. You don’t need every single detail at this stage, just the broad strokes.

To ensure that the timeline is as realistic as possible, discuss it with your team members. And give yourself plenty of time to complete the project. A small move can take up to three months to prepare, while a large one can take eight months to a year to organize.

7) List What You Have And What You Need

Making a list of what you have and what you need — be it furniture, equipment, appliances, or supplies — will help prevent overspending when it comes time to outfit the new office space.

Don’t overlook tools and supplies you use every day, like trash cans, coffee mugs, silverware, napkins, rags, cleaning chemicals, and other essentials.

And if you won’t be moving presentation equipment like wall-mounted whiteboards, projectors, or video screens, be sure to include those on your “Need” list so you’ll have them in place from day one.

8) Create Strategies To Maintain Workflow During The Move

Moving your office takes a great deal of time and effort, not only on your part but on the part of your employees as well. Sometimes an office move can take a year or more to accomplish. You can’t afford for the business to stop during that time.

Prevent team members from losing focus by creating strategies to maintain workflow during the move.

These strategies may involve more hands-on managerial involvement to keep team members engaged on project deadlines that occur during the move or negotiating the beginning of new projects until after the move is complete.

Whatever strategies you come up with, be sure to communicate this information to managers and team members alike so everyone knows what to expect once the move gets underway.

9) Create An Origin Map

During the planning stage, create a diagram of your current office space (i.e., an origin map).

On this map, group team members (or even entire departments) and their furniture and supplies by name, color code, or some other indicator. For example, you might designate your art department as blue, your IT department as red, and your customer service department as yellow.

This becomes useful later on when labeling boxes and transferring said boxes from the moving truck to the proper area in your new office space.

Mission

OPDP protects the public health by helping to ensure that prescription drug promotion is truthful, balanced, and accurately communicated. This is accomplished through comprehensive surveillance, compliance, research, and education programs, and by fostering better communication of labeling and promotional information to both healthcare providers and consumers.

Announcements

On April 24, 2024, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a revised draft guidance entitled “Promotional Labeling and Advertising Considerations for Prescription Biological Reference Products, Biosimilar Products, and Interchangeable Biosimilar Products: Questions and Answers.”

FDA is issuing this revised draft guidance to address questions that manufacturers, packers, distributers, and their representatives (firms) may have when developing FDA-regulated promotional labeling and advertisements (promotional communications) for prescription reference products and prescription biosimilar products, including interchangeable biosimilar products, licensed under the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act). In conjunction with the enactment of the Biosimilar User Fee Amendments of 2022 (BsUFA III), FDA committed to publishing a draft guidance on promotional labeling and advertising considerations for interchangeable biosimilar products on or before September 30, 2024, as described in the document entitled “Biosimilar Biological Product Reauthorization Performance Goals and Procedures Fiscal Years 2023 through 2027.” The revised draft guidance fulfills this commitment and replaces the draft guidance for industry entitled “Promotional Labeling and Advertising Considerations for Prescription Biological Reference and Biosimilar Products: Questions and Answers” issued in 2020.

Information About What OPDP Reviewers Do

OPDP reviewers have the responsibility for reviewing prescription drug advertising and promotional labeling to ensure that the information contained in these promotional materials is not false or misleading. They engage in a variety of tasks to perform this responsibility, including: providing written comments to pharmaceutical sponsors on proposed promotional materials to ensure clear and unambiguous communication of the laws and regulations relating to prescription drug promotion; reviewing complaints about alleged promotional violations; initiating compliance letters on promotional materials that are false or misleading; comparing the product labeling and promotional materials of various closely related products to ensure that the regulatory requirements are consistently and equitably applied; traveling to major medical meetings and pharmaceutical conventions to monitor promotional exhibits and activities; and acting as a liaison between OPDP and other divisions within the FDA on promotional issues.

The Bad Ad Program

FDA's Bad Ad Program is an outreach program designed to help healthcare providers recognize potentially false or misleading prescription drug promotion. The program’s goal is to raise awareness among healthcare providers including physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners, nurses, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians, and trainees about potentially false or misleading prescription drug promotion while also providing them with an easy way to report it to the Agency.

98,The Psychology Behind Modern Office Design & Workforce ...,https://serraview.com/psychology-behind-modern-office-design-workforce-well/,,"People seek out environments (including work situations) that satisfy their basic human needs. That’s a principle behind research conducted by the Interdisciplinary Center for Healthy Workplaces at the University of California, Berkeley. So if your organization is committed to attracting and retaining talent, increasing collaboration and growing productivity, it pays to address employees’ psychological needs (as well as physical ones) in the workplace. That’s why companies are implementing modern office design and workplace strategy to improve overall workforce well-being and employee experience.

In this article, we’ll explain 7 psychological drivers (identified by the Healthy Workplaces Model) that influence workplace behavior, and provide examples of ways these needs can be addressed by modern office design and other workplace strategies.

7 Well-being needs to address with modern office design & workplace strategy

The following are 7 psychological needs that drive employee behavior and well-being in the workplace, with examples of how modern office design can meet those needs.

1. PRIVACY

One reason employees are unhappy with the open office plan is lack of privacy. That’s because everyone wants privacy at some point during their workday, whether it’s to make a private phone call or to eliminate distraction and improve concentration. A modern office design that includes activity based work (ABW) spaces can address that need by providing quiet and private spaces for focus work, phone booths for private phone conversations, and small meeting rooms for small-group private talks.

2. FLEXIBILITY

According to recent research by CBRE, one of the things employees want most when it comes to their work environment is choice. That means more than flexible hours and the ability to work from home. It also means choice in their work environment. Surprisingly, it’s not only millennials that want and expect this flexibility: older generations are jumping on the bandwagon when it comes to expectations for modern office design. Activity-based work environments provide the flexibility workers want in choosing the type of space to work in based on what they need to accomplish.

Companies moving to these new strategies should be aware that they must also address the cultural shifts that are needed to support flexibility in the workplace. For example, managers need to clearly give employees permission to move around during the day, as well as model the desired behaviors themselves.

3. PREDICTABILITY

In an economic climate where rapidly accelerating change is a given, people need the comfort of being in control of their environment. When you’re implementing a modern office design with agile working for the first time, employees are probably worried about losing the predictability of their familiar desk and cubicle. That’s why it’s important to provide tools like wayfinding systems that give control and predictability back to the workforce. A kiosk or mobile app that helps them easily find the perfect space to work, locate a coworker, or find their way around an unfamiliar campus eases those concerns.

Watch this video to learn more about modern wayfinding tools: How Wayfinding Technology Can Shape Employee Experience.

To provide predictability for employees in an agile environment, you must be sure you create the right people-to-seat ratios and the right mix of spaces. There’s a science to that process as well, and it starts by implementing technology that helps you track how people are using space. Here’s a useful resource to help you sort through the utilization tracking technology options and figure out which ones you need to drive your modern office design: Managing Workplace Utilization.

4. EQUITY

All employees, regardless of their place within the organization, want to be treated equitably. That’s especially true of millennials who may feel stifled by a corporate hierarchy. Traditional workplaces emphasize the differences between workers, with the allocation of square footage and window offices indicating power and status. In a modern office design without assigned seating, status is no longer attached to workspace, which encourages more interaction between people at different levels.

5. COMFORT

Certainly workers expect physical comfort solutions in the modern office design, such as ergonomic furniture, good lighting and a properly functioning HVAC system. But features that improve emotional comfort and wellbeing are the strategies that are really attracting employees and enabling them to be productive and creative. Including green spaces, letting in natural light, and providing inspiring views are office design strategies that are making a big impact.

6. CONNECTION

Connecting with others is a basic human need that is better met with modern office design than with traditional office settings. That’s because modern agile work spaces encourage not only interaction within small teams, but between people who otherwise might never have a chance to connect. When people sit in a different spot each day, or even move around several times a day when working on different types of tasks, they have opportunities to interact, learn from and share with more people.

7. SAFETY

Of course, everyone needs to be physically safe to be productive, but employees need to feel emotionally safe in their work environment as well. Modern office design features that promote strong teams also help employees to develop those feelings of safety. Agile working “neighborhoods” as well as spaces that encourage team interaction help to build strong and cohesive team relationships where workers feel comfortable sharing ideas, expressing opinions and offering feedback.

Why modern office design must address employee well-being

It’s important to understand exactly what companies and their employees stand to gain when workplaces are designed to meet the basic human needs of employees. It turns out, implementing modern office design strategies along with wellbeing initiatives are in everyone’s best interest.

What employees gain:

Better health due to modern office design that encourages movement and even promotes better sleep.

Lower stress with addition of green spaces, outdoor views, and more flexibility to use space to help accomplish tasks.

Increased job satisfaction when they have the ability to choose how, when and where and with whom they work.

What’s in it for corporations:

Winning the war for talent. According to CBRE, 71% of workers are willing to give up other benefits to get a well-designed workplace.

234,The Truth About Open Offices,https://hbr.org/2019/11/the-truth-about-open-offices,,"Summary.

It’s never been easier for workers to collaborate—or so it seems. Open offices, messaging, and virtual-meeting software in theory make people more visible and available. But as the physical and technological structures for omnichannel collaboration have spread, evidence suggests they are producing less interaction—or less meaningful interaction—not more. This happens because individuals, not companies, decide when and how to engage with others. They become adept at shutting people out and reading signs that their coworkers wish to be left alone. Many companies don’t understand how to achieve the kinds of collaboration they want.

The authors provide guidance on reaching such an understanding. Companies can use new technologies, such as sensors that track people’s movements and software that collects their digital “bread crumbs,” to learn how members of particular groups are actually interacting. They can then experiment to learn how to achieve the types of exchanges they want: trying various office configurations, testing a pilot floor plan before overhauling the entire space, and exploring the impact of small tweaks. This approach will help them equip employees with the spaces and technologies that best support their needs.",considering new office space
230,The Ultimate Guide to Finding Office Space,https://aquilacommercial.com/pillar/the-ultimate-guide-to-finding-office-space/,,"Finding new office space can be overwhelming, but following a process and hiring a tenant representation broker can make it easier and keep you on track.

Here are five general steps your tenant rep broker will guide you through to make the process of finding new office space easier.

1. Discovery

The site selection process should always begin with discovery. Taking the time to understand exactly what your company needs is critical to getting the rest of the process right.

During this phase, your tenant rep broker will get to know your brand, company culture, location preferences, growth plans, and budget so that your broker can help you make informed real estate decisions that fit with your company’s strategy. This will include a needs assessment and timeline creation.

During the needs assessment, your broker will work with you to understand your firm’s long and short-term needs and goals.

Next, your broker will analyze the information gathered in the needs assessment and produce a realistic timeline for each step of your project.

Sample Leasing Timeline Template How long is your site selection process going to take? From discovery to move in, this timeline template breaks out each step of the process in order for you to properly plan and schedule. While every lease is different, this timeline template allows you to customize each piece of the puzzle to reflect your project's requirements. Download Your Timeline Template Now

In the rest of this guide, we will help you get started on the discovery process, helping you estimate how much office space you need when you should start looking for space, what type of office space you need, and more.

2. Search

After you decide on a strategy, your broker will begin the search for a site based on your needs and goals.

A professional tenant representation broker will do the heavy lifting on the search by preparing surveys and scheduling tours.

Your broker will find the best options for you and will compile property flyers and floorplans for each option. Then, they will create a shortlist of your top options.

Next, your broker will schedule and facilitate tours of each property. Once you have narrowed your options down to the top properties, your broker will request proposals from each landlord for you to review.

3. Analysis

Depending on the broker you hire, they may leave you to figure out the differences between each proposal.

If you hire experienced tenant rep brokers, they will provide a detailed comparison and analysis of each offer. By providing the analysis, your broker will better equip you to make the best decision for your company.

During this step, it’s also important to get construction estimates. Typically, landlords will pay for their architect to lay out your desired test fit onto a floorplan and also get a pricing estimate on your behalf. Taking the time to lay out your space and get pricing will allow you to get a full picture of the cost to build out the space. This will help you during the negotiation phase in assessing proposed tenant improvement allowances.

4. Negotiation

A good broker will help you negotiate your deal from initial proposals to an executed lease. They will facilitate communication between your company, lawyers, and the landlord throughout the process, working to keep you involved, and making sure you end up with a space and terms that best meet your needs.

The negotiation sequence typically begins with a counter-proposal.

Once you’ve received initial proposals and construction estimates negotiations begin. Your broker should draft counter proposals for each option that still meets your needs in hopes of improving the economics and other deal terms for you.

After primary negotiations with landlords, your broker will prepare a letter of intent (LOI).

An LOI outlines the key terms and conditions of the lease to be drafted and serves as a good faith agreement between the tenant and the landlord.

Based on the LOI, the landlord will then draft a lease. You, your lawyer, and your broker will perform a comprehensive review of the commercial terms to make sure they match up with the letter of intent and negotiate any final terms.

5. Build-Out and Delivery

Once your lease is signed, the next step will be to build out your office space. We recommend engaging a project manager early in the site selection process to help make this last step run smoothly.

After your lease is signed, your broker should work with you to make sure you have a strong understanding of your lease and stay in touch to periodically monitor and reassess your real estate needs and strategies. They should also check in prior to any expansion deadlines that you may have negotiated into your lease, as well as prior to your renewal option or expiration date.

706,The Ultimate Guide to PR Strategy and Planning,https://www.presspage.com/ultimate-guide-pr-strategy-planning/,,"Introduction: Do you really need a strategy? Yes. PR is a full-time job, and the day-to-day tasks are so time-consuming that teams often start missing the big picture, and instead end up focusing on tasks that might not have an impact on their core objectives. Public relations strategic planning should have a positive impact on your brand, and the best way to ensure this is to have a strategy in place, and a plan to execute it.

Your PR plan and strategy will help you navigate and prioritize every day’s demand. With established goals, you can follow the best tactics to create an impact. While every brand is different, we’ll go through the fundamental parts you need to be able to develop a strategy and plan around it using our PR tools and strategies.

Creating a PR plan that works

Take the PR strategy and planning guide with you. Download as PDF

1 Assess the situation Whether you call it an analysis or an assessment, this is the foundation of any future decisions you make. This is where PR teams and public relations strategic planning can – and should – be working with other stakeholders like Marketing, Product, Commercial, and Customer Support to get a complete overview of the business situation, and the markets or environments thin at you’re operating in. Your financial situation, business goals, corporate image, product plans, and competitors are just some examples of information you should have in your situation analysis that will inform your PR strategy and goals.

Also, keep an eye on the big picture. Consider these questions when doing public relations strategic planning: What does your industry look like today?

Have there been any significant changes in the last few years?

What might change in the coming period?

Which economic and political conditions might affect your industry?

2 Identify your audiences Sending your message out to the world at large is not an effective approach. Identifying who you’re talking to – and gaining an understanding of them – is the crucial foundation of effective PR. Taking the time to research and connect with your audience using PR Tools and Strategies will help you develop your entire approach, adding a focus and intent to your strategy that will speak clearly through your end results. Your public relations strategic planning should keep in mind two groups of audiences – your buyers, and people who can influence your buyers.

Your main target audience When developing your strategy, keep your customers front-of-mind as your main target audience. Take the time to get to know them; the customers themselves will provide the most important information for setting your PR strategy: Find out who your buyers are and why they pay for your product/s or use your services.

Define and craft the story that speaks to their needs.

Research where and how they consume media. Those who can influence your main target audience This group can include journalists, bloggers, influencers, and editors of publications in your industry. Industry experts and thought leaders with a large number of blog subscribers or social media followers, also belong to this group. Tools like BuzzSumo can help you find influential writers. If you’re a Presspage user, you could also do further research by getting access to a database with around 900 thousand media contacts, including journalists, bloggers and influencers.

Tip Do background research on where your competitors are mentioned to help you identify publications to reach out to.

You can reach your first group of audiences much better by developing better relationships with the second. You should also have an easy process set up for this group to get relevant and valuable information from you, such as establishing an SEO-optimized newsroom to make it easier for journalists in your industry to find your content.

3 Set up PR goals and objectives Public relations strategic planning goals and objectives are sometimes used interchangeably, leading to plenty of confusion. In this guide, we’ll discuss the G.O.S.T model – Goals, Objectives, Strategies, and Tactics.

Goals

What you want to accomplish overall.

Ex.: [Your brand] wants to become the best-known brand for [your product/sector] in the US. Objectives

The specific outcomes from your public relations strategic planning should define how you achieve the goal. These should be SMART (specific, measurable, agreed upon, realistic and time-based).

Ex. Increase the number of new visitors to the website by 20% in 2020. Strategies

The approach you take to achieving measurable objectives.

Ex. Implement an ambassador program. Tactics

PR Tools and Strategies you use to support the tactics that you’ve decided on.

Ex. Reach out to 50 US-based influencers and bloggers with personalized pitches. Companies have taken different approaches to applying the G.O.S.T model in PR teams. The first is by having “Goals” as the overall business or company goals, with PR objectives or strategies coming in below to support the goal.

Business Goal We want our company to be the number 1 selling brand in this industry Business Objective Increase sales by 15% this year Pr Strategies To Support Business Objective Increase traffic to our e-commerce website by collaborating with influencers and have them promote our product

The second is by setting up a complete G.O.S.T model within the PR/communications team that’s based on overall company goals or objectives.

Setting up a model like G.O.S.T is a crucial step to give your team direction when juggling multiple tasks. It might be difficult to see the impact of one press release after another, but having concrete numbers will give you a clear objective to strive for. With every public relations strategic planning activity, you can set goals such as increasing website traffic, blog subscriptions and share of voice on social media. Digital tools are crucial in helping you measure impact.

4 Develop key messages Key messages are the essence of what you want to communicate with your customers and will be the building blocks for all your tactics and activities developed through the help of your PR tools and strategies. Think of key messages as the anchor that keeps all your communication unified and consistent, and what will inform all the messaging on your other PR channels. Here are the three things to consider when crafting key messages: Revisit your company’s mission and core values.

Pick words and phrases in your brand vocabulary, avoid anything too generic or too similar to your competitors’ key messages.

Consider the assessment of your situation to address changes in the industry and any new identity that your brand wants to adopt. Your key messages should be concise, simple, and adaptable. Concise: Lengthy messages are difficult to remember and adapt. Simple: It should be easy to understand for most people. No jargon or acronyms. Memorable: In this world of information overloading, easy-to-recall messages stand out. Adaptable: for being used in different channels and various forms. Avoid using wordplay that only sounds smart, for example, in writing but not when speaking. Compelling: You want your audiences to take action. Evocative: The best messages are the ones that evoke strong feelings and the desire to be a part of something bigger than themselves. Let’s go over a quick example of a key message and its supporting messages.

“Our company’s products deliver tangible ROI”

While this is the core message we want to communicate, we wouldn’t use this particular wording in our external communication. Instead, we would create PR tools and strategies where we can drive secondary messages forward that support this key message. Supporting messages would look something like this:

“Our customers on average report an increase in revenue of 29% after 6 months of using our product”

Your PR team could complete public relations strategic planning out of these supporting messages, for example in writing articles about specific customers that have benefited from the product. Further proof points like hard-hitting quotes can be used to strengthen the message. Example:

“Since we started using this product, referral traffic from the newsroom to our e-commerce website has increased by over 180%”.

5 Identify PR channels Now it’s time to decide on how you’re going to deliver your messages to your target audiences. There are various PR tools and strategies that PR pros can use to approach their customers. It’s important to recognize that you don’t have to do it all, especially if your team is fairly small. Identify channels where your target audiences spend their time, and what tactics will get you the most value. Common PR channels that should be included in your public relations strategic planning are: A central newsroom or media center

Press releases

Blogs

Social media

Events Newsroom Whether you call it a newsroom, media center, or press page, the premise is the same; a communications hub that connects the organization with its audiences. Newsrooms tend to be at the core of a PR team’s content publication strategy. It’s a vital part of PR strategies that allows you to bring your company’s news and stories to your stakeholders in a way that’s creative, engaging, and on-brand. To successfully manage your newsroom, you need to have public relations strategic planning behind it. Set some goals and objectives for it, keep a content calendar, and measure the performance of your page.

Press releases PR professionals have always been creating and distributing press releases to get the word out. Although many have declared the death of the press release, it can still have a significant impact if done right. Here are some action points to make it an effective channel in today’s digital landscape: Offer value Only share releases that are truly newsworthy. Avoid self-promoting as it doesn’t sit well with today’s savvy, value-seeking customers. Make it SEO friendly Publish the text of press releases on your online newsroom instead of attaching a pdf version. It would help if you also share your press releases on popular PR platforms, such as HARO or PRWeb. Track open and click rates Data such as open and click rates can give you an indication of how your contact list feels about the content you’re sending them. Presspage helps you build an online newsroom at ease. You can also take advantage of our database of influencers and media contacts.

Brand journalism and blogging The practice of content marketing can help with your efforts in your public relations strategic plan. Well-crafted, high-quality articles can contain useful information for a subgroup of customers with a particular problem you earn the trust of your customers and might attract the attention of mainstream media. If you have the expertise and PR tools and strategies to create an in-depth guide or a valuable resource, you can reach out to publications and blogs to ask them to include a link to your content. This is called the skyscraper technique.

Social media Social media accounts are becoming the first touchpoint that a brand might have with many customers. You can further your interaction with followers and amplify your other content like blog posts or press releases. Many companies even have dedicated social media accounts just to engage with journalists and post news that’s why you should include this in your public relations strategic planning.

6 Plan the budget Planning a budget is central to ensuring you have the resources, PR tools, and strategies to achieve your goals. Take into consideration the cost of both earned media and branded (paid) content. PR teams commonly allocate budgets for tools, (paid) channels, events, and agencies. Agencies can be in the form of PR agencies who support the writing, pitching, and publication process, or design agencies who work with in-house PR teams to create content. Examples of the type of tools that support your PR team include those that cover publication, measurement, distribution, project management, and automation.

7 Measure the results Brand awareness is not the easiest thing to measure, and PR pros often find it challenging to demonstrate ROI in their activities that’s why you need Presspage’s PR distribution software. Here are some examples of how you can plan to measure the impact of your activities using PR tools and strategies so that you can see what’s working and what you can improve. Website traffic (organic and referral) You can measure the percentage of total web traffic that you are driving with PR activities. If you use Google Analytics, for example, you can add UTM tracking codes to all PR campaigns. The report will offer a detailed picture of how each one performs. In addition to the number of visits, you should measure: Time spent on the site and each page

The number of pages each visitor consume

The bounce rate Tools like Google Analytics and Presspage can give you insights into the traffic on your newsroom and individual press releases.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) When your audience searches for a product or service you provide, or even if they’re searching for topics online related to your industry, you want to appear on the front page of those search results. PR tools and strategies are incredibly effective at boosting SEO, and SEO is a great tactic to help increase brand awareness. Two elements of SEO that you should get familiar with: Domain Authority Domain Authority affects how likely your website will perform in search. High-quality content, which is regularly updated, has a significant role in boosting your domain authority and bringing your site higher up in search results. You can achieve that by publishing live press releases and engaging blog posts on your newsroom that include relevant keywords on what you want to rank for. Backlinks A backlink is a link on another website that can direct readers back to your site. A backlink in PR coverage means the readers can easily visit your website and learn more about your brand. When you have backlinks in publications with high readership or blogs of industry influencers, it improves your Domain Authority. Google thinks you are credible and might push your site up in its search ranking. You can check the Domain Authority of a site using free tools from Moz.com for example. Presspage helps you build an online newsroom with ease. You can also take advantage of our database of influencers and media contacts that’s why you should include this in your public relations strategic planning.

Mentions and share of voice You can use tools like Google Alerts to find out who mentions you. Remember that not all mentions carry the same weight. Featured mentions – when the article is specifically about your brand or product – as well as mentions in publications that are popular among your target audiences, tend to be more valuable. Share of voice is very interesting to measure if you have the resources available. Tools like Salesforce’s Radian6 monitor social media channels and compare how often your brand is mentioned vs your competitors to give you a share-of-voice indication.

Sentiment The sentiment is how your audience feels about your brand, product, or message. Similar to share-of-voice, this metric isn’t the easiest to measure but is incredibly important to PR teams utilizing various PR tools and strategies. How the public feels about your brand will affect your PR activities, whether your focus continues to be on increasing awareness or if you need to shift gears into crisis communication. PR teams approach sentiment analysis in various ways. Some tools in Public Relations Strategic Planning that monitor online channels have a sentiment analysis feature, where the tool will analyze what type of words are used in relation to your brand and whether these are positive or negative. Surveys that include NPS score questions are also commonly used as a way to measure sentiment.

Subscriber list The growth of your various subscriber lists can be an indicator of how your PR activities are performing. If your newsroom or media center has a subscriber list, this would be the most obvious metric to measure. Are newsletters or pitches part of your PR tools and strategies? Be sure to track how these emails are doing. Measure your open and click rates to identify what content is working, and what you can improve. If you’re aiming to build relationships with journalists or influencers and have them spread the word about your brand, your goal should be to ensure every content you’re sending them is relevant, interesting, and adds value for them. If you’re using a tool like Presspage to manage your media contact lists, be sure to monitor how your contacts are interacting with your emails. Identify which contacts are opening and clicking on your emails (and are they subsequently doing anything with your pitch?) to nurture those relationships, and be sure to rework your value proposition for the ones who are not engaging with your emails.

635,The Ultimate Guide to Your Office Build-Out or Renovation,https://aquilacommercial.com/pillar/the-ultimate-guide-to-building-out-office-space/,,"Building out a new office space can be an exciting yet daunting process, especially for companies going through it for the first time.

Companies starting their first office build-out will find this a valuable resource for demystifying the process and setting realistic expectations. By understanding the full scope of work, timeline, and costs associated with outfitting a new space, you can confidently manage the project to meet your business needs and budget.

In this chapter, we will explain what happens in each step of the build-out process, including:

Design

Construction Drawings, Permitting, and Bidding

Construction

1. Design Process

The design process will likely begin before your lease is signed. This is when you will work with your design team to define your vision, develop concepts, and eventually finalize construction documents that you can use for bidding and permitting.

Design Discovery

The design discovery phase involves defining the scope, assembling the project team, and beginning the design process while site selection is still underway.

During this process, you will engage the architects, engineers, and other consultants necessary for your project. Your tenant representation broker should be able to refer you to recommended design teams and will likely help you engage a project manager to lead the entire process.

After this, your project team will begin the process of providing test fits, project budgeting, and scheduling.

The entire process is outlined in the following sections.

Defining the Scope

The scope will outline the goals, requirements, and deliverables for the project. This includes things like:

Total square footage

Target occupancy headcount

Special spaces – conference rooms, lobby, amenities

Infrastructure needs – IT, A/V, security

Budget and schedule targets

Sustainability objectives

Branding and cultural elements

Assembling the Team

With a defined scope, you can engage the necessary design consultants, including:

Architect – develops the overall space plan and interior design

MEP Engineer – designs HVAC, plumbing, electrical, fire protection

Structural Engineer – evaluates any needed structural modifications

IT/AV Consultant – designs telecom/A/V systems and infrastructure

Additional specialists as needed – lighting, acoustics, etc.

Your project manager can refer you to qualified firms and consultants. Engaging an experienced project manager to run the process is highly recommended.

This newly formed team starts the design process by visiting potential sites and developing test fits, preliminary budgets, and schedules for each location under consideration. This information helps compare options.

Test Fits

Test fits are a crucial part of the site selection process. They help you visualize and evaluate how well a space can accommodate your company’s needs.

Once you have an architect and project manager (if you hired one) on board, they will work with you to produce test-fit drawings of the shortlisted spaces. This involves creating rough floor plans showing proposed layouts and positioning of key elements like:

Workstations, desks, and seating

Conference rooms and huddle spaces

Breakroom, cafe, and other amenity spaces

Reception area, lobby, and circulation

Support rooms – printing, IT closets, storage, etc.

The architect studies the existing base building conditions and works within the given parameters of each space. They configure the layout to optimize workflow and spatial efficiency. Different options are developed based on number of employees, department groupings, preferred workstyles, and any special requirements unique to your company.

The test fits help you visualize how well a space can actually accommodate your headcount and spatial needs. They provide an early gauge of what construction will be required – demolitions, walls, finishes, MEP, etc. This gives a general idea of the tenant improvement budget required.

Reviewing multiple test fit options allows you to provide feedback and give direction to the design team on which layout works best. The final test fit becomes the framework for design once you are ready to move forward.

Preliminary Budgeting and Scheduling

During the test fit process, a project manager can develop preliminary budgets and schedules to help compare build-out costs and timelines across the spaces you are considering.

Budgets

For each test fit option, the project manager can create a preliminary budget based on the proposed layout and scope of work. This factors in estimated costs for required construction, furnishings, AV/IT, security, signage, permitting fees, etc.

Comparing preliminary budgets for different spaces will help you determine which option aligns best with your overall project budget goals. It also allows you to negotiate an appropriate tenant improvement (TI) allowance in your lease to sufficiently cover anticipated build-out costs.

Schedules

The project manager can also produce a high-level schedule for each test fit scenario to estimate durations for design, permitting, and construction. This helps give a sense of how long the build-out would take to complete for each space.

Having schedule estimates during the site selection process enables better decision-making on timeframes. It ensures the space can be delivered according to your business needs and occupancy goals.

Design Development

Once the lease is signed, the design team will take the approved schematic design and further develop it into the design development phase. This involves refining the spatial layouts, material selections, and design details.

The architect will create design studies to explore different options for the office layout. This includes developing further test fits to optimize the workspace configuration and determine desk, meeting room, common area, and support space quantities and sizes.

The selection of interior finishes begins during design development. The architect will present finish options like flooring, wall treatments, ceilings, millwork, and furnishings. Color schemes, artwork, and graphic displays may also be developed.

Engineers assist with building system designs for mechanical, electrical, plumbing, AV/IT, security, and lighting. Any specialty lighting, acoustical treatments, or environmental graphics are specified. Signage and wayfinding systems are designed.

It is crucial that the project team and tenants are heavily involved at this stage. The design team will present options to gain feedback and consensus on the layout and finishes. This ensures the design suits the client’s functional needs, brand identity, culture, and goals. Changes are still relatively easy at this phase before construction drawings are produced.

The end goal is for the client to approve the final design development package, which sets the direction for documentation and construction. This includes floor plans, interior elevations, finish schedules, furniture plans, and technical system designs.

2. Construction Drawings, Permitting, and Bidding

Construction Drawings

Once the design is agreed upon, but before construction can begin, the project team must produce the final construction documents that will be used to bid out the project with vendors, submit them to the city for permitting, and as a reference during the actual construction process.

The construction drawings include detailed plans, sections, elevations, and specifications for all aspects of the buildout. This includes architectural drawings showing floor plans, ceiling plans, interior elevations, finish schedules, and construction details. Structural engineering drawings may be required for any structural modifications. Mechanical, electrical, plumbing, and fire protection drawings will show all related systems.

The construction drawings must adhere to all applicable building codes, regulations, and accessibility standards. They should accurately represent the final built design, dimensions, materials, and assembly methods. The specifications will outline standards, procedures, materials, quality control, and performance criteria.

The detailed construction drawings are a crucial step that transitions the design from conception to physical construction. They act as the blueprint for the entire buildout process. Careful coordination between the project management, architectural, engineering, and contractor teams is essential to produce a clear, comprehensive set of construction documents.

The bidding and permitting stage begins when the complete set of construction drawings is finalized and ready to submit for pricing bids from general contractors and subcontractors. The drawings are also submitted to the local building department for plan review and permitting. This ensures the design meets code requirements.

Permitting

When Permits Are Needed

Permits are required in Austin for construction, renovation, demolition, or significant modification of commercial spaces. This allows the city to review plans and ensure compliance with building codes and safety standards. Always consult with a project manager to determine if your specific plans require a permit.

Permit Expediters

Your project manager will likely recommend that you hire a permit expeditor. Permit expediters act as liaisons between the project team and city officials to streamline the process. They compile all necessary drawings, forms, fees, and documentation for submission. Expediters communicate with reviewers to resolve any questions or issues with permit applications. Their expertise results in a more efficient review and approval process.

Timelines

For standard office build-outs, permitting typically takes six to eight weeks in Austin. Exact timeframes depend on factors like city review backlogs, code changes, construction volumes, and staffing levels. Permitting may take longer for complex projects or major renovations. Rush fees can help expedite simple permits.

Fees

Permit fees are based on the valuation of construction. Other charges may apply for plan reviews, inspections, and other administrative tasks. All fees must be paid before the permit is issued.

Starting any work before obtaining permits can risk denial and lead to fines, work stoppages, or rework. Proper permitting is crucial for all commercial construction projects.

Vendor Bidding & Selection

While permits are being processed, it’s time to solicit pricing and select the vendors who will execute the build-out. A project manager can guide you through this process:

RFP

The project manager sends out a request for pricing (RFP) or bid invitation to reputable general contractors and subcontractors in your area. RFPs are also sent to vendors for IT, security, cabling, furniture, etc. as needed.

The RFP includes the final construction drawings and specifications. It requests a detailed bid for completing the defined scope of work.

Review and Selection

The project team reviews the competitive pricing received and evaluates each vendor based on bid cost, qualifications, experience, and references.

The team selects the vendors that provide the best overall value – contractors and subcontractors for each trade, plus any additional suppliers or providers.

3. Construction Process

With the construction drawings finalized, your permit in hand, and the team hired, the physical construction process can begin.

Depending on the scope of your project and the initial state of your space, this process can vary greatly and might include:

Demolition

Framing and drywall

Ceiling

Finishes

Millwork

Mechanical, electrical, plumbing (MEP)

The timeline for this phase can range anywhere from a few weeks to several months, depending on the project’s scope.

For reference, a Class A build-out of a 20,000-square-foot shell space would take an estimated 32 weeks to complete, while the same build-out of a second-gen space would take about 20 weeks.

Vendor Items

Once construction is complete, the final vendor items will be installed to outfit the space before move-in. This includes audio/visual equipment, signage, and furniture.

The AV vendor will install any audio/visual systems specified in the plans, such as video conferencing equipment, projectors and screens, speakers, and microphones. They will test all systems to ensure they are functioning properly.

The signage vendor will install any interior and exterior signs, including lobby directories, office and conference room signs, wayfinding signs, and branding elements. Signage helps create a professional look and makes it easy for employees and visitors to navigate the space.

The furniture vendor will deliver and install all specified furniture, fixtures, and equipment (FF&E). This includes workstations, private offices, conference room furniture, lobby furniture, kitchen appliances, and more. The furniture will be assembled and placed according to the furniture plan.

Punch List

The last step before you occupy the space is a walk-through with the project team. During the walk-through, they will identify anything that does not match the construction plans or that is not up to standard.

These items are added to a “punch list.” The general contractor or vendor responsible for each item is required to complete or correct each issue before they receive the final payment.

Typically, the punch list will be completed either during or after move-in. If small items need to be corrected, work can be done around employees during working hours. If there is larger or louder work that needs to be done, timing can be negotiated to include weekend and after-hours work.

After the punch list is completed, one final walk-through should be done to confirm that everything was addressed, meets the construction drawings, and is to your satisfaction.",new office space planning
41,The White House Building,https://www.whitehouse.gov/about-the-white-house/the-grounds/the-white-house/,,"Our first president, George Washington, selected the site for the White House in 1791. The following year, the cornerstone was laid and a design submitted by Irish-born architect James Hoban was chosen. After eight years of construction, President John Adams and his wife Abigail moved into the still-unfinished residence. During the War of 1812, the British set fire to the President’s House, and James Hoban was appointed to rebuild it. James Monroe moved into the building in 1817, and during his administration, the South Portico was constructed. In 1829, Andrew Jackson oversaw the addition of the North Portico. Various proposals were put forward during the late 19th century to significantly expand the President’s House or to build an entirely new residence, but these plans were never realized.

In 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt began a major renovation of the White House, including the relocation of the President’s offices from the Second Floor of the Residence to the newly constructed temporary Executive Office Building (now known as the West Wing). The Roosevelt renovation was planned and carried out by the famous New York architectural firm McKim, Mead and White. Roosevelt’s successor, President William Howard Taft, had the Oval Office constructed within an enlarged office wing.

Less than fifty years after the Roosevelt renovation, the White House was already showing signs of serious structural weakness. President Harry S. Truman began a renovation of the building in which everything but the outer walls was dismantled. The reconstruction was overseen by architect Lorenzo Winslow, and in 1952, the Truman family moved back into the White House.

Every president since John Adams has occupied the White House, and the history of this building extends far beyond the construction of its walls. From the Ground Floor Corridor rooms, transformed from their early use as service areas, to the State Floor rooms, where countless leaders and dignitaries have been entertained, the White House is both the home of the President of the United States and his or her family, and a living museum of American history. The White House remains a place where history continues to unfold.

There are 132 rooms, 35 bathrooms, and 6 levels in the Residence. There are also 412 doors, 147 windows, 28 fireplaces, 8 staircases, and 3 elevators.

The White House kitchen is able to serve dinner to as many as 140 guests and hors d’oeuvres to more than 1,000.

The White House requires 570 gallons of paint to cover its outside surface.

At various times in history, the White House has been known as the “President’s Palace,” the “President’s House,” and the “Executive Mansion.”",plans to expand office
84,The history of the open-plan office space,https://mikomaxsmartoffice.com/en/open-plan-office-space-how-has-it-been-developing-over-the-years-the-history-of-the-open-plan-office-space/,,"The way office spaces are arranged has undergone dynamic changes over the years. The growth of digitalisation, changing ways of working and work culture and new employee preferences have led to different concepts for open-plan office arrangement. The workplace of today is no longer just an office building located in the city centre, but first and foremost it is a multifunctional space, divided into zones with ergonomic furniture, reminiscent of a flat, local café and a meeting place. Let us take a look at the history of the open-plan space and how it has changed employees’ perceptions of the environment where they do their work. Open-plan space – what type of office is it? The open-plan office refers to a large open area that typically has no partitions or other physical barriers that would separate various areas and workstations. In the open-plan office, multi-station working spaces are created, and they are sometimes divided into smaller clusters. It is often the case that desks are grouped into islands for better team collaboration. There are also independent stations for staying more focused on your task. The open-plan space requires thoughtful design and flexible modern office furniture to improve privacy and acoustics – the factors that employees complain about most often. The history of the open-plan office space – how did it start? The exact date of the emergence of the open-plan space is difficult to pinpoint for certain. Office work has a history of many years of change and development. The first offices appeared during the Industrial Revolution as a result of the demand for administrative support for rapidly expanding factories. Located in warehouses or factories, they were nothing like the well-kept green spaces of today’s businesses though.

It was not until the 18th century that special office buildings began to be built.

In the 1960s, the so-called Bürolandschaft movement was involved in experiments with different office layouts in order to find the most efficient solutions.

Noise and lack of privacy in the open space prompted the search for new concepts. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Robert Propst’s Action Office concept became popular. He designed a modular office system that would adapt to the needs of employees in order to facilitate communication and collaboration . However, large corporations have simplified Action Office assumptions, which resulted in ‘cubicle farms’. We are familiar with that landscape of small cubicles packed closely to each other, which mainly remains a thing of the past.

. However, large corporations have simplified Action Office assumptions, which resulted in ‘cubicle farms’. We are familiar with that landscape of small cubicles packed closely to each other, which mainly remains a thing of the past. The development of teleworking, the result of technological progress in communication and data transmission, began in the 1990s and has continued to this day. This encouraged a new look at how the office should function. Who is believed to have invented the open-plan office concept? Architect Frank Lloyd Wright is credited with this advancement, as he was the one to promote in the early 20th century the idea that walls and closed rooms in the office served no good purpose. According to him, open space improves creative thinking, communication and removes barriers between employees. Many companies, however, used to interpret this concept slightly differently. Rather than focusing on the social aspects and improving the quality of work, corporations saw that open spaces will allow more employees to be crammed in less space, thus lowering rental costs. In the 1950s in the United States, the open-plan office space began to resemble factory floors, where people worked in a single room and the loud sounds of typewriters, telephones and conversations were a day-to-day reality. Those in senior positions tended to use separate offices that were a symbol of their position in the company. Open-plan space concept evolution The concept of open-plan space has evolved over the years as it has adapted to the changing needs of employees and organisations. A key moment in this transformation was when the German architectural firm Quickborner marketed modern desks in 1950. The workstations were separated from each other by small partitions. This arrangement gave employees more privacy and a sense of having their own space. The idea quickly caught on to became standard in many offices around the world. In Poland, the open-plan work space system gained popularity in the 1990s, when, after the political transformation, large international corporations began to start their offices in this country. Although it has been in use for many years, open-plan office design is still favoured by organisations, albeit in a more modern form.

The evolution of open-plan work – the present and the future The evolution of office spaces over the years has come to a point where designers of modern open-plan spaces are keen to use home office design and draw on Activity Based Working or Agile Working concepts. In modern open-plan offices, they have begun to combine approaches developed over the last 100 years. Collaboration is balanced with privacy, and efficiency goes hand in hand with comfort. The contemporary open-plan space offers areas for meetings, team brainstorming and individual work. The barrier-free office has provided employees with a variety of workspaces to support their well-being, health, efficiency and creativity. The hot desking concept – workplace selection Developments in technology and the popularity of working in hybrid mode have meant that people want to be able to do their work from anywhere – not just within the company, but around the world. Employees are no longer tied to their workstation, and the diversified nature of the work they do (video calls, client meetings, brainstorming, teamwork, phone calls) means they spend less and less time at a standard desk. This is why more and more organisations are choosing to introduce hot desks, which are part of the trend towards flexibility and mobility. A workspace system in which an employee has no assigned desk when arriving in the office and takes any desk that is not occupied is ideal for companies operating in a flexible hybrid model. The advantages of introducing hot desking include keeping your desk tidy, staying in touch with people outside your department and being able to move freely, to name but a few. What our expert says Caring about staff well-being means that, for this approach, Stand Up R height-adjustable desks are the best choice. Thanks to proprietary adjustable worktop systems, their height can be easily adjusted to suit a person’s height and to enable standing-up or sitting positions. It is a remarkably versatile piece of furniture, as several of these desks linked together create a solution that provides both private and shared workspaces – says Eliza Donek, Product Manager at Mikomax.

Open-plan office divided into zones – common but separate space When arranging modern open-plan offices, designers are currently trying to reconcile two needs – collaboration and privacy. This translates into the concept of a variety of zones in the open-plan space, which are adapted to the specific needs and tasks carried out by the teams. A noticeable trend is the use of mobile partitions in open space, which allow contemporary desks to be separated, when need arises, from sources of noise (printers, colleagues having lively discussions). They provide privacy and shelter from distractions while remaining open. The Soniq mobile partition system, which can be arranged in rows and perpendicularly, allows the creation of a workspace for small teams or individual space for conceptual work. They are fitted with castors in their stabilising feet for more mobility available at all times. All this brings about the office of the future – a space that is attractive, functional and flexible, as well as it can be adapted to the changeable requirements of employees. You can also read Divide and conquer – with the SONIQ modular office wall system Multifunctional space in the open-plan space – one space, many possibilities In order to adapt open-plan offices to the dynamically changing needs of employees, flexibility of arrangement is essential. For this purpose, free-standing tree-like partitions are ideal. They can improve acoustic comfort by being ‘planted’ anywhere in the office. They can also be an interesting decorative element, which additionally fits in with the currently popular biophilic design. Modular and wheeled furniture allows the space to be easily transformed by changing its character, depending on the situation, from a workplace to a chillout zone to a business meeting area. The Ligo cubicle system allows a variety of combinations to be created, from desks and shelves to seating and storage spaces. Their versatility and ease of rearrangement make them ideal for the dynamically changing environment of the modern office. Chillout zones in the open-plan space – shared space not only for work In a modern open-plan office designed according to the concept of well-being, which supports the physical, mental and emotional health of staff, it is important to create appropriate communal spaces. Smaller chillout areas, large chillout rooms with hammocks, designer sofas and couches, coffee tables and entertainment areas are where relationships start, problems are solved or the best ideas come to mind. Also, they are places that you can relax and refresh in on comfortable soft seating furniture after long hours of being focused on a task, talking to a contractor or brainstorming.

Biophilic design – open-plan office closer to nature Biophilic design is not just a fad in interior design, but a genuine desire to get closer to nature, with a host of benefits to offer. This approach in open-plan office spaces is expressed with unique places that are both elegant and harmonious, reflecting the power and beauty of nature. Elements such as natural light, plants, water, wood, stone and green walls transform the space in such a way that the user feels more relaxed, focused and happy.",planning new office location
4,The productivity tax of new office concepts: a comparative ...,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11301-022-00316-2,Автор: A Gerlitz,"In this section, we provide an analysis of the 46 reviewed papers and show the influence of office concepts on the other dimensions. A summary description of all reviewed articles is provided in the Appendix of this paper. First, we briefly introduce the different office concepts. Second, we analyze the dimension “work” by looking closer at the level of distractions and interaction. Third, we consider the effects of personality fit. Fourth, we evaluate employee satisfaction with the environment, interaction, and job. Fifth, we examine the influence on health. Sixth, we examine the effect of enabling paradigm on performance, and finally, seventh, we look at the cost paradigm. Each aspect is analyzed with respect to the specific office concept. We conclude each section with a summary.

3.1 Office concepts

The literature does not use a single common terminology for office types. To align the language of different researchers, we developed the following taxonomy to define the different office concepts based on Duffy and Powell (1997) and Danielsson and Bodin (2008).

3.2 Work: Sometimes it is distraction, sometimes it is interaction!

3.2.1 Level of Distraction

A recurring theme in the reviewed studies is noise-induced distraction. When speech intelligibility cannot be ensured, occupants feel distracted, and their satisfaction and performance diminish. Appel-Meulenbroek et al. (2021) studied occupants' coping strategies for different noise sources. Their findings show that choosing a specific coping strategy depends on the origin of the noise; for instance, when the noise source is near one's desk, occupants use the avoidance strategy by interrupting their work or trying to be quieter. However, the stress level will remain when trying to ignore the noise. Göçer et al. (2019) compared higher and lower performing OPOs and found noise as one predictor of lower performance. As distractions lead to greater stress and frustration, more errors are made (Mark et al. 2008), and collaboration is reduced (Škerlavaj et al. 2018). Noise appears as a consistently reported problem in OPO; see Hedge (1982). Wadu Mesthrige and Chiang Yat (2019) show that interruptions, overcrowding, and noise negatively influence the occupants' performance in OPO. Roskams and Haynes (2020) show that reducing the level of distraction results in higher productivity, which is in line with Roelofsen (2008). They also find that lower perceived distraction is associated with higher psychological comfort and enthusiasm, which is consistent with previous studies (Haynes 2008; Veitch et al. 2007; Candido et al. 2016).

Roelofsen (2008) states that in an office where potentially disturbing conversations take place the ideal noise level should be around 45 dB (A) and never be higher than 48 dB (A). Furthermore, noise can lead to working pressure, cause fatigue, depression, and reduces overall satisfaction (Jahncke et al. 2011; Sander et al. 2021). Personality and work tasks influence how employees perceive the disturbance level (Oseland and Hodsman 2020; Roelofsen 2008). Banbury and Berry (2005) found that 99% of their participants report concentration problems due to background noise from other employees. They also show that noise distraction is higher in OPO than in single offices. Pejtersen et al. (2006); De Been and Beijer (2014); Kaarlela-Tuomaala et al. (2009), and Kim and De Dear (2013) provide further evidence that the distraction level in single offices is the lowest. To cope with noise distractions in OPO, quiet work areas are a needed remedy (Chacon Vega et al. 2020; Chadburn et al. 2017; Roelofsen 2008; Seddigh et al. 2015). Employees moving from OPO to ABW perceive better conditions for concentration (Blok et al. 2009; Candido et al. 2019; Haynes et al. 2019; Rolfö et al. 2018). But distraction still play a role in ABW (Rolfö et al. 2018). It leads to less concentration (Keeling et al. 2015) and therefore less productivity (Wadu Mesthrige and Chiang Yat 2019) compared to single offices. Roelofsen (2008) recommends incorporating smaller closed office spaces to better cope with noise distraction. Noise distraction is a widespread problem in open office environments, especially in OPO, but also in ABW. The distraction level depends on the job role and personality and affects the occupants' performance. A growing number of employees are looking for quiet work areas. In a world where knowledge workers are in high demand, companies may be well recommended to reconsider OPO as the dominant office concept.

3.2.2 Interaction

Interaction is linked to noise and distraction because it can be seen as its counterpart. New office concepts like OPO and ABW have been designed to facilitate interaction, but face-to-face communication decreases in OPO environments (Brennan et al. 2002; Sailer and Thomas 2021). Bernstein and Turban (2018) examine how human interaction patterns change because of the architectural shift from a traditional office to an OPO. Gathering data by tracking face-to-face interaction with wearable sociometric devices and gaining data from electronic communication servers, including e-mail and instant messaging, they conducted two intervention-based field studies at corporate headquarters. Their results show that workers in unbounded offices reduce face-to-face interaction by 70%. The researchers observe that the employees try to isolate themselves as best as possible, pretending to be remarkably busy. In addition, the occupants feel observed and transparent. As a result, they choose electronic communication tools. When dealing with complex cognitive tasks that require deep work, irrelevant environmental stressors such as undesired interaction should be avoided to enable the occupants' performance. Chadburn et al. (2017) show that knowledge workers opt for a flexible range of office environments that offer room for quiet concentration work as well as areas for collaborative tasks. The ABW concept allows one to balance these needs (Keeling et al. 2015).

When experiencing a shift from OPO to ABW, employees notice an increase in interaction (Divett 2020; Blok et al. 2009; Haynes et al. 2019). Those with the autonomy to decide where and when to work perform better (Fincke et al. 2020). According to Rolfö et al. (2018), a proper time and space management system is indispensable for any ABW. Rolfö et al. (2018) find that a lack of communication and rules will lead to high people-to-workstation ratios. Problematic situations occur when a workspace is unsuitable for a given activity and team members do not find workstations close to each other. As a result, teams are scattered all over the place due to overcrowding and cannot collaborate as intended. Furthermore, participants report insufficient amounts of arrangements to have a collaborative gathering and that this lowers their performance. The architectural solution ABW does not automatically result in human interaction. The ABW setting requires rules, time, and space management to foster collaboration (Rolfö et al. 2018). Interestingly, two studies conducted in Teheran and Malaysia came to different results. Samani et al. (2017) studied employees in creative mobile industries (programmers and designers) in Malaysia. The findings show an increase in social interaction and creative output in OPO. A similar study from Teheran concludes that OPO increases interaction and employees experience a more democratic working culture (Samani and Alavi 2020b). The contradictory results of these two studies appear to be related to cultural differences. Although models that describe cultural differences have their limits in revealing in depth the cultural complexity of a country (Sure 2017), they can offer the first understanding. The Hofstede cultural distance model shows that power distance plays a significant role in Malaysia (100), is essential in Iran (58), and is less important in the UK and Germany (35) (Hofstede 2021). That leads to the assumption that the experience of open office concepts is modulated by culture. Bouncken et al. (2016) show that multicultural teams have the potential to increase innovation and creativity but likely struggle with different working and communication styles.

The physical office environment can trigger processes that foster personal interactions among employees and the quality of these relationships in the work context with respect to social and task-oriented bonds (Khazanchi et al. 2018), which may positively influence performance. Depending on the office concept, these interactions may become unintended background noise that distracts other co-workers and reduce their performance. Managers can influence with the implementation of office concepts the quality of the social interaction among their employees. All actors should be involved and participate in this process (Vereycken et al. 2021). ABW requires more conscious and deliberate planning than other office concepts. Sailer and Thomas (2021) conclude that the most unplanned interaction takes place in single/shared offices because workers in single or shared offices visit each other spontaneously. These spontaneous interactions occur more often because, unlike in OPO, other occupants are not affected by these interactions. Interaction.

3.3 Personality fit: different strokes for different folks!

Individual differences, such as personality traits, influence how individuals perceive their work environment and how they perform. Wadu Mesthrige and Chiang Yat (2019) find that OPOs only suit extroverts but are not a good fit for introverts and highly sensitive people. In general, introverts prefer to have their own dedicated workspace. In contrast, extroverts are generally open to OPO concepts. This study also shows that conservative workers reject working in an OPO. These results are in line with the findings of Oseland and Hodsman (2020), who show that the performance of introverts is lower in an OPO setting. Going deeper into the behavior of different personalities in an open office setting, Appel-Meulenbroek et al. (2021) find that high extroverts tend to be quieter, medium extroverts are more likely to interrupt their work, while high neurotic choose to continue their work at home (if possible). Each office concept requires a specific way to deal with its unique atmosphere, which resonates with the personalities of the occupants, so that a given office concept may improve or reduce performance.

3.4 Satisfaction: a place to call my own!

Scholars have been studying the psychological outcomes of office concepts, especially satisfaction. The reviewed studies focus on three aspects of satisfaction: environmental, interpersonal, and job. Roskams and Haynes (2020) find that reducing the level of disturbance improves satisfaction in OPO, which leads to greater environmental comfort and increased productivity. Another factor that increases satisfaction within an OPO setting is personal control over one's workspace (Ahmadpoor Samani et al. 2017). Two studies show that satisfaction with the work environment decreases after relocating from single offices to an OPO (Kim and De Dear 2013; Bergström et al. 2015), which is in line with Oldham and Brass (1979), who show that motivation decreases among employees who relocate from a single office or shared office to an OPO. They point out that motivation is related to interaction with colleagues and overall job satisfaction. Danielsson and Bodin (2008) concluded that job satisfaction is lowest in the OPO setting, which supports the evidence of other studies reviewed above, so we must conclude that OPO has a negative impact on satisfaction. A well-managed ABW gives employees autonomy to choose a workspace and therefore gives them control over privacy and noise, increasing employee satisfaction. For example, employees report an increase in satisfaction when moving into ABW with respect to auditory privacy and background noise (Rolfö et al. 2018). Other scholars have reported equivalent results (Candido et al. 2019; Divett 2020). Furthermore, occupants of ABW report that they like the new aesthetics but criticize the time and space management (Rolfö et al. 2018); see section “interaction” of this paper. As ABW does not allow for personal workstations, time and space management are crucial to ensure that work can be done. Employees complained that it is very hard to find an appropriate office space unless they come very early in the morning (Engelen et al. 2019). Additionally, Taskin et al. (2019) show that new employees are initially enthusiastic about the typical ABW environment but find themselves disoriented after working there for some time because they cannot easily locate relevant co-workers to address their questions. These two studies show that ABW occupants find the design stylish or appealing at first glance, but they also reveal the major problems of working in a flexible environment. In traditional settings, each person has a designated workstation which is often located according to hierarchy. An ABW is solely based on current tasks, hence not allowing a straightforward way to maneuver across the office floor. ABW is associated with a loss of orientation that leads to an overall experience of dissatisfaction. There is a trend these days to put a lot of ambiance and funny props in ABW. But Appel-Meulenbroek et al. (2011) show in their study that ABW should not incorporate too much of it because these elements are often unpractical and occupants refuse to use them. Instead, office environments should offer their occupants opportunities to personalize their workstations (Arundell et al. 2018; De Been and Beijer 2014; Candido et al. 2021; Kaarlela-Tuomaala et al. 2009; Gorgievski et al. 2010; Sidorenkov et al. 2022). Taskin et al. (2019) show that anonymous office designs of OPO and ABW make employees feel dehumanized, dispossessed, abandoned, and injuncted to adapt the modern behavior, which causes ill-being and dissatisfaction with the office environment. Therefore, employee satisfaction is influenced by the physical characteristics of the work environment and the implementation process (Brunia et al. 2016; Candido et al. 2021). Candido et al. (2021) show that interior design and physical configuration play a crucial role in employee satisfaction and productivity. They conclude that if ABW is well implemented and well-designed, it will fit many organizations across different industries. Satisfaction is rated lowest in OPO. In ABW, satisfaction is limited by its implementation and management; however, occupants have personal control in ABW, which adds to its overall appreciation. However, employee satisfaction is still highest in single or shared offices and lowest in OPO. It appears that employees who feel at home at work are more satisfied and hence perform better.

3.5 Health: flourish or perish!

The reviewed studies of office concepts show mixed results on health. Moving from an individual office to OPO has negative effects on health. Bergström et al. (2015) show that after 12 months of working in the new OPO environment, employees' feeling of health deteriorated. This study investigates the long-term health effects of employees after three, six, and twelve months. This study measures “intrapersonal characteristics” (for example, feeling stressed) and “interactive function” (for example, feeling supported by colleagues) using the Salutogenic Health Indicator Scale, a test instrument that covers physical, mental, and social well-being. The rated health perception deteriorated. After three months, the differences are significantly worse; at six months, no significance can be measured, but at twelve months, perceived health deteriorates significantly. Bergström et al. (2015) see a possible explanation for the time when the enquiry after six months took place: it was just after the prime vacation time in summer. This may also have influenced the workers’ perceived health of workers. Another reason is that the employees adapted after a half-year of working in the new office environment. An acclimatization phase that followed an initial culture shock can be recognized after 3 months. Then, after 6 months, this effect stabilizes. If this effect were just a culture shock, recovery was to be expected after 6 or 12 months. But we see from their results that perceived health is even worse after 1year. Therefore, one can isolate the effect and one can observe a longitudinal negative effect on health in an OPO. Not being able to control environmental conditions such as air quality, temperature, humidity, noise, and lighting has a negative effect on health (Mulville et al. 2016). Mulville et al. (2016) show that behavior influences health; see also (Haynes 2007). Employees who take breaks more often suffer less from headaches and noise distractions. People take breaks when they feel exhausted. Feeling exhausted may stem from two leading causes: negative effects of the work environment, e.g., bad air, high noise, etc., or the desire to take back personal control. Danielsson and Bodin (2008) show that personal control is a significant indicator of preventing mental stress and strengthening health. In both cases, occupants try to counter the negative effect of the work environment and do something to improve their health.

As the OPO concept has adverse effects on workers' health, the new concept of ABW addresses these issues by giving employees control over where and when they prefer to work and by stimulating physical activity (Engelen et al. 2019), which nudges employees towards a healthier lifestyle. Candido et al. (2019) find that perceived health improves after relocation from an OPO to an ABW environment. Their post-relocation results show that occupants significantly reduce their sedentary time. Foley et al. (2016) conducted a similar study but found that breaks or step counts do not change significantly after relocation from OPO to ABW. Another pre-post study by Arundell et al. (2018) focusing on the shift from a traditional office to ABW reveals no significant improvements in sedentary time. Occupants describe an increase in incidental movements for job-related communication. Furthermore, this study also examines the eating behaviors (which no other study has done before). They concluded that ABW leads to healthier eating behavior. However, food vending machines were not available in the new office environment and a new policy banned eating at desks. The workers ate together in designated areas which increased peer pressure to eat healthier. It is not only the design of the office space that fosters a healthier lifestyle, but a new policy that is enforced and implemented at the same time with the new office concept. Appel-Meulenbroek et al. (2011) concluded in their study, which they conducted in four service organizations in The Netherlands, that implementation is key to success. ABW is more than a floor plan but requires a policy of use to ensure that workers benefit from it. If not properly implemented, ABW results in dissatisfaction and increased illness. Danielsson and Bodin (2008) examined seven distinct types of offices’ influences on health and satisfaction. Validated questionnaires were used, including self-reported sick leave, general health, and physiological and psychological problems of the occupants. The lowest health status was found in small and small OPO, and the best health status was found in single offices and ABW. Pejtersen et al. (2011) came to comparable results. They find that OPO occupants have a significantly higher number of sick leaves than those in single offices and suggest five mechanisms to explain the increased sickness absence rates in OPO: These might be (1) noise, (2) air quality, (3) spread of infections, (4) lack of privacy, and (5) lower autonomy.

Based on insights from the COVID-19 pandemic, the OPO concept may need to be reconsidered as high office density increases the risk of cross infections (Zhang 2020; Samani and Alavi 2020a) and could lead to a reversal of the current trending OPO (Megahed and Ghoneim 2020). To conclude, long-term health effects have been studied by a few scholars. The impact of office concepts on health, and therefore indirectly performance, appears to be strong. The data of this SLR suggest that OPO is the least healthy workspace; ABW motivates employees to do physical activities, which has a positive health effect that is also reflected in their performance. But the healthiest office work environment appears to be the single office.

3.6 Enabling paradigm: make a workplace work!

Depending on the industry, labor costs make up about 80% of the total cost, and real estate costs account on average for only 10%, shows a study of multinational companies (Pfnür 2013). Thus, savings in real estate costs are relatively small in comparison to costs that are caused by a decrease in productivity through these office concepts (Appel-Meulenbroek et al. 2018; Haynes 2008): “Just a 2% decline in productivity can wipe out a tenant's cost savings (…)” (Newmark Grubb and Frank 2016). This leverage effect is dubbed the “productivity tax”. As an example: There are $550B annual losses in the US productivity of employees (Gallup 2013), as productivity is a matter of enabling workers to do their tasks. The critical drivers of productivity are team interaction and decision making (Divett 2020). Employees interact more and make better decisions when their overall satisfaction is ensured. Ahmadpoor Samani et al. (2017) and Haapakangas et al. (2018) show in their studies that supporting employees' satisfaction and improving environmental comfort motivate them to perform better. Göçer et al. (2019) find that individual space and personal control are the strongest predictors of productivity. These findings are in line with Herzberg's theory of motivation. In summary, these results show that the performance depends on the work environment and work conditions. To increase productivity, companies should implement appropriate workspaces that enable employees to master their specific work in an atmosphere that enhances individual satisfaction. As all other measures are lowest at OPO, so is productivity, as research by Bernstein and Turban (2018); Bergström et al. (2015); Ahmadpoor Samani et al. (2017); Roelofsen (2008); Roskams and Haynes (2020) shows. A shift from OPO to ABW has a positive impact mirrored by employee performance. Candido et al. (2019); Blok et al. (2009); Divett (2020) show that productivity increases when occupants move from OPO to ABW, but Rolfö et al. (2018) conclude that there is no change in productivity. Arundell et al. (2018) investigate the transformation from traditional offices to ABW and find a decrease in productivity. The single office outperforms OPO and ABW in all aspects, as studies from Pauls and Lütke Lanfer (2017); Krupper (2011); Danielsson and Bodin (2008); De Been and Beijer (2014); Taskin et al. (2019); Sailer and Thomas (2021) reveal.

3.7 Control paradigm: what counts may not be what accounting counts!

Rising real estate costs led to a reassessment of office space occupancy (Węziak-Białowolska et al. 2018). Cost reduction is the most obvious rationale for transforming into OPO (Haynes 2007; Brunia et al. 2016; Baldry and Barnes 2012). As Blok et al. (2009); Parker (2016) show, ABW is even more cost-efficient than an OPO. Cutting real estate costs has a direct impact on performance. However, in the long run, the drawbacks of this short-term perspective become obvious.

Implementing office concepts plays an essential role in overall corporate success. Optimized office concepts can increase employee productivity by up to 13% (Pfnür 2013). Furthermore, companies can set a signal by incorporating attractive workplaces in the “war of talents” (Pfnür 2013; Jurecic 2020), which plays an essential role in employee retention and recruitment. The results of the study by Bauer (2014) show that being able to work self-determined positively impacts the work-life balance, resulting in higher motivation and higher overall performance. This may ultimately lead to a new human-centered approach to management in which employees are empowered to participate early in the process (Edwards and Ramirez 2016; Vereycken et al. 2021).",plans to open new office

Multinational companies relocating headquarters to Saudi Arabia in 2023 to secure government contracts are more likely to get tax exemptions, says Khalid Al-Falih, Minister of Investments.

Al-Falih commented in a conversation with Financial Times, where he noted that an announcement would soon be issued to clarify the regulations for the multinational companies. Companies outside KSA will still be taxed in the entities’ country of operations and will not be intermingled or mixed with the regional headquarters in the Kingdom.

The move further incentivizes entrepreneurs to set up shop in Saudi Arabia. It’s part of the Regional Headquarters Program (RHQ), launched in 2021, to invite global companies to relocate their regional headquarters to Saudi Arabia.

According to Al-Falih, these multinational companies that move their headquarters to KSA will be taxed only for limited profits, and most likely, those companies will be granted tax relief. The minister noted Saudi Arabia wants to avoid incurring additional costs for companies, and the biggest one is taxation.

About 80 companies, including Unilever and Siemens, have been granted licenses to relocate their regional headquarters to Saudi Arabia.

307,Thousands of civil service jobs set to move from Whitehall ...,https://www.civilserviceworld.com/professions/article/thousands-of-civil-service-jobs-set-to-move-from-whitehall-to-east-london,,"Cabinet Office says ""around 5,700 full time civil and public servants"" to make the move from central London to Canary Wharf by 2018

Almost 6,000 full time civil service and public sector jobs are set to relocate from Whitehall to London's Canary Wharf over the next few years, under plans unveiled by the Cabinet Office.

The Government Property Unit on Tuesday announced that one of its new ""Government Hubs"" – buildings serving a number of government departments in one location – will be based at 10 South Colonnade, Canary Wharf, a 25-year-old site that was part of the first wave of Canary Wharf development.

According to the Cabinet Office, ""around 5,700 full time civil and public servants"" will make the move from their offices in Whitehall to the 50,354 square meter East London address by 2018.

HMRC announces major office closure programme – full regional breakdown and reaction

Cabinet Office minister Matt Hancock: government to vacate 75% of sites by 2023

The move comes as part of the government's wider aim of closing 75% of its offices by 2023, with smaller local sites phased out in favour of larger hubs, which are likely to serve several departments.

This summer's Civil Service Workforce plan, setting out HR strategy for the government over the next four years, also emphasised the use of smart working in the new offices, saying improvements in technology would allow the ""untethering"" of staff from their desks to create ""truly shared spaces where departments can work effectively together"".

HMRC last year became the first department to unveil a mass programme of office closures as part of its move to the new model.

Minister for the Cabinet Office, Ben Gummer, said the new Canary Wharf hub would ""provide a better working environment for many London-based civil servants at considerably less cost to the taxpayer"".

The government has not provided detail on rates for the 15-year lease from Barclays, the current occupiers of the site, but said it was ""in line with the vast majority of large property deals in the UK"" and stressed that lease payments would be ""taxable in the UK"".

Gummer added: ""We have some of the most talented people in the UK working in the civil service and it is right that we provide them with the right environment so that they can serve the public to the best of their abilities.

""We will be replicating this approach across the United Kingdom, putting right the historic mistake of forcing public servants to work in ugly and expensive buildings.""

The Cabinet Office said the East London hub had been chosen because of both its lower cost when compared to Whitehall and its ""exceptional public transport connections to the rest of London and the UK"", pointing out that the area is set to benefit from the 2018 opening of the Crossrail train line. It is also served by the Docklands Light Railway.

The department promised detail on the departments set to make the move ""in due course"".

626,Tips for Office Relocation | Workplace Strategy,https://www.axiomworkplaces.com.au/blog/tips-keeping-next-office-relocation-schedule,,"Many people underestimate the time it takes for an office relocation and end up stressed, over budget and behind schedule. The key to avoiding this?

Effective planning.

We recommend you start reviewing your options around 12 to 18 months before your existing office lease expires, regardless of whether you are renewing, renegotiating or relocating.

If you’ve decided to move offices, here’s a general timeline of activity to help you stay on time and on budget.

Develop a workplace strategy: 2-4 weeks

Before starting your search for a property, it’s best to undertake a workplace strategy. This will help you define the goals of the business and understand what kind of space will support your business now and in the future. Your workplace strategy will include a needs analysis, an accommodation analysis and a location feasibility study. This process generally takes around two to four weeks, and is well worth it.

Search for a property & lease space: 6-9 months

Finding the right space can take time, but it’s an important decision that will affect the long-term success of your business, so it’s important to be patient. Your workplace strategy will help you narrow down options for your new space.

The next steps are to:

Inspect potential properties

Submit offers for short-listed properties and start negotiations

Choose your preferred property and finalise negotiations

Conduct spatial test fits and a building evaluation

Provide final approval and sign the lease

Design your space: 8-10 weeks

Once you’ve leased your property, it’s time to start planning what is required in the new premises. You should start with an in-depth briefing and a needs analysis with a design consultancy firm.

Get fees from a number of design consultancy firms, preferably ones with the capacity to build, as this will make for a smoother refurbishment process. Once you’ve chosen your preferred design, develop contract schedules and seek any statutory approvals required.

Delivery: 10-12 weeks

Don’t underestimate the time it will take to have all furniture and fittings delivered and installed. Renovation works like reflooring and painting should be factored into your timeline.

The big move: 2-4 weeks

Planning ahead will help you minimise downtime and ensure your team can set up their workspaces and get settled in with a minimum of fuss. You’ll need to work closely with your delivery team to ensure they move items at a suitable time and place them in the correct position.

Account for extra contractors you may need to set up and test your IT networks and phone systems so your staff can get on with their work in the new office fast. This is especially critical if you are taking existing equipment from old office to new; if it’s nearing end of life (or end of lease) consider replacing it.

535,Top 6 Reasons New Businesses Fail,https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/1010/top-6-reasons-new-businesses-fail.aspx,,"The first years of a new business are often the hardest. New business owners must struggle to find capital, suppliers, and customers, all while trying to find enough income to pay their bills. In order to be successful, it is essential for new business owners to prepare for these risks.

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), approximately 20% of new businesses fail during the first two years of being open, 45% during the first five years, and 65% during the first 10 years. Only 25% of new businesses make it to 15 years or more. These statistics haven't changed much over time, and have been fairly consistent since the 1990s. Though the odds are better than the commonly held belief, there are still many businesses that are closing down every year in the United States.

According to the BLS, entrepreneurs started 1,054,052 new businesses in the year ending March 2023. From the historical data, we can expect approximately 210,810 of these businesses to fail within the first two years. With the right planning, funding, and flexibility, businesses have a better chance of succeeding. We'll go through some of the biggest mistakes that startups can make and figure out how to improve your chances of success.

Key Takeaways New businesses have the highest chances of failing, due to the combined pressures of raising capital, finding customers, and bringing in enough income to pay their bills.

About 45% of new businesses fail within the first 5 years.

Failure to research the market, and prepare a business plan are common reasons for business failure.

Many companies do not raise enough starting capital, which is essential for new businesses without a reliable revenue stream.

For more established businesses, there is also a danger of expanding too fast, without conducting enough market research.

Investopedia / Ellen Lindner

1. Not Investigating the Market

So you've always wanted to open a real estate agency, and you finally have the means to do so, but your desire to open the agency blinds you to the fact that the economy is in a down housing market and the area where you want to work in is already saturated with agencies, making it very difficult to break in. This is a mistake that will result in failure from the start. You have to find an opening or unmet need within a market and then fill it rather than try and push your product or service in. It's a lot easier to satisfy a need rather than create one and convince people that they should spend money on it.

2. Business Plan Problems

A solid and realistic business plan is the basis of a successful business. In the plan, you will outline achievable goals for your business, how your business can meet those goals, and possible problems and solutions. The plan will figure out if there's a need for the business through research and surveys; it will figure out the costs and inputs needed for the business, and it will outline strategies and timelines that should be implemented and met.

Once you have the plan, you should follow it. If you start doubling your spending or changing your strategies whimsically, you are asking for failure. Unless you have found that your business plan is overwhelmingly inaccurate, stick with it. If it is inaccurate, it's best to find out what's wrong with it, fix it, and follow the new plan rather than change how you do business based on quick observations.

The more mistakes you make, the more expensive your business will become and the greater the chance of failure. You may also be called to pivot when market conditions change drastically and impact negatively the chances of success based on the initial business plan. In this case, you revisit your plan and edit it fully based on the decided pivot.

According to a study by U.S. Bank, 82% of business failures are due to insufficient cash flow.

3. Too Little Financing

If you have started a company and things aren't working out, and you have little capital and a struggling business, you're not in a good position to ask for another loan. If you're realistic at the beginning, you can plan to start with enough money that will last you to the point where your business is up and running and cash is actually flowing in.

Trying to stretch your finances at the beginning may mean that your business never gets off the ground, and you'll still have a lot of cash to repay. Lean management strategy is warranted in this phase in particular but can be applied even after this phase. Try to think of multi-channels for funding and financing. Get educated about this area and be creative searching alternative sources of financing.

4. Bad Location, Internet Presence, and Marketing

A bad location is self-explanatory if your business relies on location for foot traffic. Just as dangerous, however, is a poor Internet presence. These days, your location on the internet and your social media strength can be just as important as your company's physical location in a shopping district. An online presence will let people know that they can give you their business, so if the need is already there, the availability and visibility of your business is the next important step.

This is similar to marketing. Not only must you make sure that marketing reaches people, but it must also reach the right people. So make sure the type of marketing lines up with the audience you want to reach. Big billboards may not be the way to go for an internet company, just as online ads may not be the way to go for a heavy-construction business. If the need is already established, make sure you're reaching the audience who needs your product or service.

5. Remaining Rigid

Once you've done the planning, established your business, and gained a customer base, don't become complacent. The need that you're fulfilling may not always be there. Monitor the market and know when you may need to alter your business plan. Being on top of key trends will allow you lots of time to adjust your strategy so that you can remain successful. One must only look at the music industry or Blockbuster video to know that successful industries can undergo huge changes.

6. Expanding Too Fast

Now that your business is established and successful, it's time to expand, but you must treat the expansion like you're starting all over again. If you're expanding the reach of your business, make sure that you understand the areas and markets into which you'll now be reaching. If you're expanding the scope and focus of your business, make sure you understand your new products, service and intended consumer as much as you do with your current successful business.

When a business expands too fast and doesn't take the same care with research, strategy, and planning, the financial drain of the failing business(es) can sink the whole enterprise.

Why Do Most Startups Fail? Most new companies do not survive the startup phase, with 20% failing after the first year. Surveys of business owners suggest that poor market research, ineffective marketing, and not being an expert in the target industry were common pitfalls. Bad partnerships and insufficient capital are also big reasons why new companies fail.

What Is the Biggest Risk for Small Businesses? One of the biggest hurdles for small businesses is running out of working capital. Since small businesses tend to have a low cash flow, they also have less financial cushion if they face economic hardship, and need to borrow or find investors when they face financial difficulty.

How Do You Find the Best Market for Your Industry? Finding the right target market is a major hurdle for new companies, and entire industries exist to help market your products to the right consumers. Marketing professionals use focus groups, surveys, and in-person meetings with potential consumers to find out who their customers are, and what products they are looking for.

The Bottom Line

Though the rate of business failure in the first two years is around 20%, it doesn't mean that you have to fail. Through research, planning, and flexibility, you can avoid many of the pitfalls of a new business and be a part of the approximately 25% that make it to 15 years and beyond.",plans to open new headquarters
332,Top Technology Considerations when Opening a New Office,https://www.entechus.com/blogs/top-technology-considerations-when-opening-a-new-office,,"The expansion of any business is an exciting endeavor. If you’re finally making the leap of securing an additional office location, it’s important that you take the right steps to ensure that your technology is working properly before you begin conducting business. Everything from phone systems, cabling, dealing with vendors and internet service has to be set up. It can be a little overwhelming, but with a little planning and assistance, office moves and new locations don’t have to be difficult. Here are the most important technology considerations when opening a new office.

Internet Service Provider

Your employees need to be connected in order to work effectively. Rather than settling for the provider that you’ve always had, be sure to shop around in order to determine what’s best for your organization’s needs. It’s important that you have the appropriate bandwidth to ensure that your employees can be efficient without paying for something that you don’t need. It’s best to find a local resource with knowledge of the internet service providers. Reliability of service is the most important factor, but you should look into how responsive they are when issues arise as well. Ask around to other local businesses in the space that you’re moving into to get a better idea for which providers are better than others.

Building infrastructure

Whether you’re building your office space brand new or moving into an existing structure, it’s important to look at building infrastructure to determine how you need to cable and set up your network. If you’re building new, you can obviously customize this to suit your needs, but keep in mind that you should engage your IT provider before you do any space planning. This will help ensure that you can get connectivity to every employee and workstation. You’ll also want to ensure that your network closet will accommodate your hardware and look into how you’ll control the temperature in that room.

Phone System

When moving or opening a new location, it’s important to look at other phone options that might better fit the needs of a growing organization. There are many different options and VoIP providers that have begun offering continuous communication services and cloud-based phone service for flexibility that you cannot achieve with a standard phone system. Engage a professional and do your diligence regarding the phone systems for your new location. Here’s a great article offering three things to demand from your business phone service that may help.

Software and Hardware

Yes, there’s more. Don’t forget to navigate licensing for additional users, purchase the right workstations for your users’ unique needs and look into your network setup to determine if you’ll want to upgrade servers or make a cloud move. Use this time to make an assessment of the software that you’re using to ensure that it meets your needs.

Logistics

Perhaps the most time-consuming part of an office move or expansion is the logistics. While you may think that your office administrator can handle the move from a technology and vendor management perspective, the reality is that they’ll be busy dealing with movers and other logistics. Planning workstations and meeting technology vendors (phone, internet, cabling, IT) is only part of it. There’s also budget management, long term strategy, coordination and timing. Your ISP has to connect service, your cabling company must drop the cables, your phone service provider has to set up your system… it can all be overwhelming. Make sure that you have a plan in place or designated individual that will handle all of the details. An experienced Managed Service Provider or Project Manager is the best way to ensure that all the details fall into line perfectly.

A little overwhelmed? It’s a lot to do and by no means is this an all-inclusive list of considerations. When it comes to the expansion of your organization you shouldn’t leave it in the hands of a single technology resource or administrative role. Make sure that you engage a professional to help you plan strategically for the long term and choose the technology infrastructure, phone service, hardware, software and manage all the details.",future office expansion plans

News and notes from around town:

• With heat indexes already at or near the century mark, I’m all for more ways to access frozen custard. (Don’t get me started on attempts to get my cow to produce frozen milk. She’s still upset.) Instead, this idea involves a slight expansion at a local custard shop.

Plans have been filed at Lawrence City Hall for Culver’s, near the intersection of 33rd and Iowa streets, to add a double-drive thru lane that is not only wider but much longer.

The restaurant chain, which serves frozen custard in addition to hamburgers and other sandwiches, is taking a round-about way of adding more drive-thru space: It is going through a vacant car lot.

County property records indicate the owners of the Culver’s property at 2111 W. 33rd St. earlier this year purchased the adjacent used car lot at 3301 Iowa St. that previously housed a branch of AutoExchange.

AutoExchange closed that car lot more than a year ago, and it has been looking for a buyer ever since. Now, the plans filed with City Hall show that Culver’s intends to use the parking lot of the former dealership to house its drive-thru lanes.

However, the plans don’t call for demolishing the former auto dealership building. Rather, the plans say the building, which is small but very visible from Iowa Street, will be kept and used as an office building. For what type of business, the plans don’t say. However, it will be an unusual arrangement, as the building basically will be encircled by the drive-thru lane.

photo by: City of Lawrence/Kimley Horn

The plans also call for some additional outdoor patio space to be added to the Culver’s site.

The project is seeking mainly technical site plan approvals from City Hall. Assuming those approvals are granted, the project hopes to begin construction in October, according to the plans on file.

•••

Moving on to another role for the cow, I have a bit of an update on a major barbecue restaurant coming to Lawrence. As we reported in January, Kansas City’s Q39 restaurant has inked a deal to locate in downtown in a portion of the former Journal-World printing plant building.

There are new signs that restaurant project soon will be getting started at the site, which is just south of Sixth and New Hampshire streets. The project has filed a site plan at City Hall, which details how the business plans to remodel the site.

The concept remains the same as we’ve reported: The project will locate in the former mailroom portion of the Journal-World printing plant. That puts it on the east side of the former Journal-World complex, meaning the restaurant will face New Hampshire Street. The plans, as expected, show both a dining room and bar space for the business.

A few details of note on the plan include:

• The business is looking to create a unique connection to Massachusetts Street, which is one block to the west. The alley that serves the former Journal-World printing plant is unique because it is not straight. You enter the alley on Seventh Street, but the alley is ‘L’ shaped, so you exit the alley on Massachusetts Street. Perhaps you haven’t noticed, but there is a driveway just north of the Kring’s Interiors building. That’s a public alley.

The site plan for Q39 makes reference to using that alley as a new pedestrian walkway that would lead customers to a backdoor to enter Q39. The idea isn’t a surprise, as the developers briefly mentioned it when announcing the Q39 deal. But the idea isn’t a common one in downtown, so it has been worth watching whether it remains in the plan.

Thus far, it remains. However, this particular site plan doesn’t provide details about how the alley might be improved to better accommodate pedestrians. Lawrence attorney Patrick Watkins, who is representing developers on the project, said those details will be included in a future filing for the broader development of the area. He said increased lighting, new pavement and other amenities are likely. However, he said any design will have to be multifunctional. The alley will continue to serve vehicular traffic. Delivery trucks still use the alley to serve businesses in that block.

• The design features a big garage door, which may be appropriate given that the portion of the building the restaurant will be in used to be a loading dock. In this case, though, don’t look for semi-trucks to back up to it. (I like brisket as much as the next guy, but usually I can fit my lunch in the backseat and the trunk.) Instead, the business appears to want to use the garage door to open the area up and create an indoor-outdoor type of space.

Along those same lines, the plans call for the handful of off-street parking spaces that exist on the old Journal-World property to mainly be converted into an outdoor patio or landscaped area. The plans show an outdoor bar that would be underneath one of the canopies that extend from the building.

Indoor/outdoor types of spaces are a big idea with the whole development. If you remember, the Q39 proposal is just one use proposed for the former Journal-World site. Kansas City developer Vince Bryant has proposed converting a large portion of the former printing plant into an open-air entertainment and food court area. He would do so by removing the roof from a portion of the building, while leaving the walls standing. Inside would be a mezzanine, a stage, an area for yard games, and during the winter, perhaps, an ice rink.

Plans for that part of the development haven’t yet been filed. But Watkins told me Bryant is still very much interested in moving forward with such a development, and he expects plans to reach City Hall in the next couple of months. The same goes for another part of the project that would convert the part of the former Journal-World building that fronts Massachusetts Street into a 15,000-square-foot, high-class office space. No tenant has been announced for that spot, but the development group has been working with potential users.

While the new headquarters was under construction, the real estate and facilities team used Wisp ’s interactive scenario planning tools to finalize departmental adjacencies in the new space. Wisp was then used to create the final seating assignments and communicate to the move team where each employee’s belongings should go. Today, all Toyota employees benefit from wayfinding in Wisp — using it locate colleagues, conference rooms, collaboration spaces, and more. The facilities team relies on Wisp to manage employee churn with move management tools and access real time reporting for key metrics.",plans to relocate headquarters
59,Transit Projects & Studies | Maryland Transit Administration,https://www.mta.maryland.gov/transit-projects,,"BMORE BUS is a new transit plan for the for the Baltimore region that will develop recommendations for improvements to bus service types, frequency, and destinations over the next five-to-ten years. Once complete, BMORE BUS will inform the annual updates that MTA makes to bus service each fall, working to implement the priorities identified in the plan.

The MARC Growth and Transformation Plan will update and expand upon the MARC Cornerstone Plan, last published in 2019, which provided strategic priorities for the system and the capital investment needed to achieve those initiatives. This long-range plan synthesizes MTA plans, policies, and reports with performance data, local and national trends, and stakeholder input. MTA is comprehensively analyzing this information to create targeted recommendations for growth and investment that coordinate with the needs of the transit system overall.

The Penn-Camden Connector (PCC) project will restore a historic rail connection, to be used primarily for passenger trains between the two Maryland Area Regional Commuter (MARC) rail lines serving Baltimore – the Penn Line and Camden Line.

The Red Line is a high-frequency, high-capacity transit line for the Baltimore Region, and will be an investment in residents’ access to jobs, education, services, and opportunities. This project addresses a major gap in east-west transit service between Bayview and Woodlawn, through downtown Baltimore City.

The Purple Line is a proposed 16-mile light rail line extending from New Carrollton in Prince George's County to Bethesda in Montgomery County. It would provide a direct connection to the Metrorail Red, Green and Orange Lines. The Purple Line would also connect to MARC Train, Amtrak and local bus services.

MDOT MTA is leading the development of a new Regional Transit Plan for Central Maryland. Providing a 25-year vision of mobility, this plan will define public transportation goals for Central Maryland including Anne Arundel County, Baltimore County, Baltimore City, Harford County, and Howard County.

MDOT MTA is developing a new Statewide Transit Plan to provide a 50-year vision of coordinated local, regional, and intercity transit across the state. This plan will define public transportation goals and strategies for rural, suburban, and urban regions of Maryland to provide coordinated, equitable, and innovative transit.

In accordance with the Maryland Zero Emission Bus Transition Act, MDOT MTA submits an Annual Report detailing the Administration’s progress during the past year towards achieving zero-emissions fleet conversion goals, including an analysis of potential carbon emissions reduction and capital and operating expenses that will result from the conversion, as compared to the Administration continuing to purchase, operate, and maintain diesel buses. Current projects include:

MDOT MTA is investing $43 million in our core service area through the Fast Forward: Customer Experience Enhancement Project, accelerating projects that create a transit system that is more reliable, accessible, and easier to use. Funded by the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Fast Forward improvements are targeted for final design by the end of 2023 and construction or installation in 2024.

MDOT MTA is working with local jurisdictions to increase bus reliability, speed and passenger safety throughout the BaltimoreLink system. MDOT MTA has pursued a data-driven approach to identify opportunities in the system, focusing on reliability, bus speeds, and travel delays at bus stops. Potential targeted investments to the roadway that prioritize transit riders include curb-extensions at bus stops, transit signal priority, dedicated bus lanes, queue jumps, and more. Current corridor efforts include:

Transit Hubs Initiative

Transit Hubs are transfer points for multiple transit routes or modes. Typically, a transit hub includes enhanced amenities (shelters, benches, information). MDOT MTA is pursuing a community-driven and data-driven approach to identify opportunities to improve the customer experience, make transfers easier between bus routes and at rail stations, and improve multimodal connections. Potential improvements can include increased seating and shelters, lighting, widened sidewalks, and other amenities to improve safety, comfort, access, and overall enjoyment of the transit experience. For more information, please contact transitpriority@mdot.maryland.gov.

MDOT MTA is the 13th largest multi-modal transit system in the United States, operating and maintaining $12.6 billion in physical assets to provide transportation services across the State of Maryland. Investing in the state of good repair (SGR) of these assets and system enhancements is critical for MDOT MTA to deliver safe, efficient, reliable, and customer-focused services. The MDOT MTA Capital Needs Inventory (CNI), consistent with ongoing transit asset management (TAM) analyses, outlines the unconstrained investment needs between 2022 and 2031 that will help MDOT MTA meet current and future service demands and system performance goals. Since 2019, the relative size of the SGR backlog has decreased, and expected levels of state and federal funding will meet 98% of SGR needs over the next 10 years.

MDOT MTA has worked collaboratively with government and non-government partners to pilot new shared and on-demand mobility services and technologies to enhance our riders' transit experience. Following early successes, MDOT MTA has published a Shared Mobility Work Plan to communicate to the public our existing and planned partnerships and our commitment to remain nimble and embrace new business models and technologies benefiting transit riders.

Cornerstone Plans

The Cornerstone Plans translate MDOT MTA's mission statement into strategic priorities, policies, programs, and initiatives for each transit mode. MDOT MTA is committed to responsibly managing assets to support long-term operational demands while seeking ways to enhance customers' experiences. Each Cornerstone Plan synthesizes MDOT MTA plans, policies, and reports with performance data, local and national trends, and stakeholder input. The agency comprehensively analyzes this information to create targeted recommendations for growth and investment in each mode that coordinate with the needs of the transit system overall. For any questions or comments regarding the cornerstone plans, please contact cornerstoneplans@mdot.maryland.gov.

MDOT MTA is undertaking the Brunswick Line Expansion Study to evaluate opportunities for expanded service on the Brunswick Line that are identified in the MARC Cornerstone Plan. The Study will define potential phasing of future service enhancements and identify the associated infrastructure investments needed to accommodate those service levels. The study will include an evaluation of existing rail operations and station access, markets for increased ridership, as well as operating and capital costs to support service expansion.

A key element of the Frederick Douglass Tunnel Program led by Amtrak is the reconstruction of the West Baltimore MARC Station. This Program will modernize a ten-mile section of the Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor (NEC) in Baltimore for Amtrak and MARC trains. The new station will be constructed approximately 100 feet west of the existing station and will include new features such as ADA accessibility, platform canopies, restrooms, indoor waiting areas and public art.

For complete Program information Visit The Frederick Douglass Tunnel Program website.

TOD provides an opportunity to encourage economic development and maximize the return on existing transit investment. MDOT MTA has created multiple tools, including the TOD Design Guidelines, as resources for local jurisdictions, developers, and communities who are considering development at or near a rail station. The Maryland Departments of Planning and Transportation (MDP and MDOT) have also created comprehensive online planning and implementation resources to support state and local TOD efforts.

To increase the reliability and efficiency of the LocalLink 75 route and improve the rider experience, MDOT MTA has worked with partners and stakeholders to develop a flexible, on-demand microtransit pilot in the area between BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport, Arundel Mills Mall, and Parkway Center.",plans to expand office
472,Treasury Releases New Analysis Showing Historically ...,https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2402,,"WASHINGTON — Today, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office Economic Policy released an analysis that shows American businesses are doing well not simply because their earnings are high, but because they are investing those earnings productively. The Biden Administration has made creating favorable conditions for business investment a critical competent of the post-COVID economic agenda. The CHIPS & Science Act and Inflation Reduction Act explicitly encourage private investment, while other Administration efforts increase competition and reduce barriers to entry for new firms. Business investment strengthens our economy’s long-run productivity while creating space for higher-quality jobs.

This analysis comes before Secretary Yellen’s remarks to the Economic Club of New York on Thursday, June 14, where she’ll discuss President Biden’s Investing in America Agenda and the ways the Administration is partnering with the private sector to spur growth across the country.

Highlights from the analysis:

American business investment is outperforming expectations in the post-pandemic expansion; businesses have invested $430 billion more since 2019 than if investment had followed historical patterns. Despite high interest rates that increase firms’ borrowing costs, real American business investment has outperformed three key benchmarks: typical behavior in economic expansions, post-COVID consensus forecasts, and the conventional accelerator models that economists use to forecast investment.

Despite high interest rates that increase firms’ borrowing costs, real American business investment has outperformed three key benchmarks: typical behavior in economic expansions, post-COVID consensus forecasts, and the conventional accelerator models that economists use to forecast investment. Factory building (construction for manufacturing) has contributed almost one third of business investment growth since the pandemic. Factory building did not contribute to business investment growth on average from 1973 to 2021, but since then it has contributed a third of overall business investment growth. Intellectual property investment has also grown, while conventional equipment investment has slowed. With factory building concentrated in the computer, electrical, and electronic sector, the trend appears to be related to the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act.

With factory building concentrated in the computer, electrical, and electronic sector, the trend appears to be related to the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. The outlook for future business investment growth is encouraging: firms are observing persistently high returns to their capital, and founders are starting new businesses at historic rates. Today’s persistently high returns to capital give businesses confidence that their investments will pay off in the future and negate the idea that public investments are crowding out private capital. These high returns are persisting even as the Administration works to rein in non-competitive monopolistic practices that may have boosted these returns in the past. Business founders are showing confidence in the investment outlook, as applications for new businesses surge above pre-pandemic rates.

(WCBD) — A longtime Williamsburg County manufacturing facility reported its plan to shut down by January 2025, laying off over 100 employees at the plant.

Tupperware, a home product line that most notably produces various storage containers for food and other kitchen appliances, says it is shuttering its Hemingway facility, resulting in the layoffs of 148 employees.

Layoffs will begin Sept. 28 with the plant permanently closing by Jan. 14, 2025, according to a worker adjustment and retraining notification act.

In a statement to News 2, Tupperware Brands said that eligible employees will be offered severance packages and early retirement. They will also be provided with a chance to connect with other businesses at a job fair for future employment.

“It’s important to note this decision is not a reflection of the performance of the Hemingway tea,” Tupperware said.” “We appreciate each of our valued team members and the many years of service they have dedicated to our salesforce and to the Company.”

The brand sold the Hemingway plant in 2023 and plans to move manufacturing operations completely to Lerma, Mexico. Media officials said that is where the bulk of products sold in the US and Canada are made already.

The South Carolina facility is the only manufacturing facility the brand has in the US. The company’s headquarters is in Orlando, Florida.",plans to relocate headquarters

Trends & Industry News: Debt Service Looms Over Offices

The wave of office distress many anticipated has yet to materialize, but our latest U.S. office market report shows that many markets are exposed to potential distress.

Debt service coverage ratios — a measure of net operating income against current debt obligations — have declined for offices in recent years due to the two components of the ratio moving in opposite directions. As interest rates shot upward in the last year and a half, so did debt costs for commercial real estate. At the same time, cash flow has fallen — U.S. office vacancy rates spiked as firms downsized or eliminated physical office footprints altogether — and expenses have grown. Despite DSCRs’ downward movement, market-level average ratios show only a handful of markets exposed to widespread risk.

Using aggregated and anonymized income and expense data along with researched loan information and vacancy rates, CommercialEdge estimates market-level DSCRs for many of the metros covered by the service.

Everyone has been asking “where is this wave of distress?” The reality is that it didn’t materialize with extensions the last few years, but we are seeing an uptick, and this data shows the threat is still there in many areas. Peter Kolaczynski, Director, CommercialEdge

In March, five of the 91 markets analyzed by CommercialEdge had average DSCRs below 1.0: Brooklyn, N.Y. (0.81), Oklahoma City (0.89), Chicago (0.90), El Paso (0.92) and Cleveland (0.96). Another eight markets — including Manhattan (1.05), St. Louis (1.16) and Nashville (1.25) — sit at or below the 1.25 ratio that most lenders require. However, it is important to note that these market-level rates are only estimates, and DSCRs can vary vastly from property to property.

Many properties within markets with low average DSCRs continue to perform well, while properties in markets with a high average DSCR face distress. CommercialEdge has DSCR estimations at the property level to identify potential future distress situations.

The forces behind downward pressure on DSCR are unlikely to reverse in the near future, according to office real estate outlooks. Demand for offices remains stagnant as hybrid and remote work has become fully entrenched within many firms. Expense increases, like insurance and maintenance, have cooled in recent months but continue to eat into net operating incomes. Interest rate cuts may begin this summer, but in all likelihood, will not be steep enough to save properties that are teetering on the edge of distress. Office loans that mature are at greater risk of distress and delinquency because of the difficulty of generating enough cash flow to cover debt obligations in the current environment. Many in the sector have adopted the mantras of “extend and pretend” and “survive until ‘25,” hoping for circumstances to improve next year.

Listing Rates and Vacancy: Vacancies Grow Everywhere

The national average full-service equivalent listing rate was $37.66 per square foot in April, a decrease of eight cents from the previous month and 1.5% year-over-year, our latest U.S. office market report reveals.

Top Listings by Metro Area: April 2024

The national vacancy rate was 18.3%, an increase of 160 basis points year-over-year. U.S. office vacancy rates have been on the upswing in nearly every market. Tech markets have been hit the worst, with San Francisco (650 basis point increase over the last 12 months), the Bay Area (400 bps) and Seattle (400 bps) all experiencing significant increases. Markets with a high concentration of financial jobs, like Dallas (390 bps) and Charlotte (380 bps), have also seen large jumps in the last year. Even lab space centers like Boston (230 bps) and San Diego (370 bps) have seen vacancies rise despite the in-person nature of most work in the life sciences field.

Supply: New Office Starts Disappear

Nationwide, 83.7 million square feet of office were under construction as of April, representing 1.2% of stock. The office under-construction pipeline has shrunk by more than 50% in the past 18 months, as buildings have been completed and starts have slowed to a crawl.

Office Space Under Construction (Million Sq. Ft.)

Office starts have been nearly nonexistent in 2024, with just 3.2 million square feet of new space breaking ground through the end of April. While office construction began slowing in response to the shifts the pandemic brought to office utilization, some development was still occurring.

In 2023, 44.2 million square feet of office space broke ground, buoyed by the life science and medical office sectors. Now, even development for those uses has dried up. Our office real estate outlook predicts that once interest rate cuts begin, developers will slowly dip their toes back into the water, but given the current state of office demand, it may be years until there is a meaningful uptick in office starts, office real estate outlooks suggest.

Transactions: High-Quality Assets Remain in Demand

Across the U.S., a total of $7.5 billion in transactions have been logged so far this year, with properties trading at an average of $157 per foot.

Top-tier assets in quality locations remained in demand, as evidenced by Columbus Properties’ $86.1 million purchase of 24th at Camelback I. The eight-story, LEED Platinum-certified, Class A building is in one of Phoenix’s hottest office submarkets. It marked the largest sale recorded by our database in the Phoenix market since 2022, yet the sale price was lower than the $100 million the property traded for in 2018.

Western Markets: San Francisco Vacancy Rates Climb 650 Basis Points Amid Declines in Employment

Tech markets in the West experienced the largest increase in U.S. office vacancy rates, with San Francisco leading at 25.9%, up 650 basis points year-over-year — the highest uptick among the top 25 U.S. office markets. Due to the tech sector’s poor performance, office employment in the city has fallen 4.9% compared to last year. The Information sector alone lost 13,000 workers in the past 12 months, representing a 10.5% drop, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

While San Francisco remained the priciest market in the West, asking rents decreased 9.3% year-over-year in April to an average of $59.30 per square foot. San Diego was the only market with a steeper decline in asking rents, falling 9.8% year-over-year to $43 per square foot. Despite being a market driven mainly by life sciences, San Diego also saw its vacancy rates rise 370 basis points over year-ago figures to 18.4%.

West Regional Highlights

In the Western region, Phoenix and Portland recorded vacancy rates below the national average of 18.3%, with Phoenix at 17.5% and Portland at 16.2%. Despite these lower vacancy rates, both markets logged some of the most affordable asking rents in the country: Phoenix's rents were $27.67 per square foot, up 120 basis points year-over-year in April, while Portland's rents declined by 7.4% over the same period to $27.22 per square foot. Across the top 25 office markets in the U.S., Minneapolis-St. Paul ($25.83 per square foot), Orlando ($24.84) and Detroit ($22.46) were the only metros with lower rates.

From a transactional perspective, the Bay Area led the region in sales volume, with $469 million in closed office deals year-to-date through April at an average of $231 per square foot. The next-largest sales volume was recorded in Phoenix, totaling $349 million, with properties trading at an average of $199 per square foot, according to our U.S. office market report.

The metro’s sales volume was boosted by Columbus Properties’ $86.1 million acquisition of a 309,400-square-foot top-tier office building at 2375 East Camelback Road. Despite being the largest sale in Phoenix since 2022, the property traded 14% below its price in 2018, when the seller, New York Life Insurance, bought it for $100 million.

With the office sector facing several challenges, from reduced demand to high interest rates, office sales nationwide have been driven by institutions selling high-quality assets to balance their portfolios, reduce their office exposure, and mitigate risk on their balance sheets. Nonetheless, the market is evolving to include owners who are selling because they are facing distress and upcoming loan maturities.

Midwestern Markets: Chicago Logs $208M in Sales Through April Amid Distress Hitting the Market

While borrowers often adopt the ""extend and pretend"" approach, a loan extension wasn't enough to save Pennsylvania-based Pembroke IV from a $25 million foreclosure lawsuit. The company failed to pay off debt tied to a six-story building at 2001 York Road in Chicago.

The property was first added to the pool of distressed offices in January 2023, after Pembroke hadn’t paid off its loan by December 2022. At the time, the loan was modified, and the maturity date was pushed to March 31, 2024, but the extension didn’t make a difference, according to Crain’s. The building was only 58% leased for most of last year, and its net cash flow hadn't been sufficient to cover Pembroke's debt service for the past two years.

Midwest Regional Highlights

As of March, Chicago had $6.8 billion of maturing loans through 2024, representing 19.4% of the market's total loan volume, our data shows. Meanwhile, the market’s vacancy rate stood at 19.1%, up just 30 basis points year-over-year in April, and rents contracted by 20 basis points, coming in at $27.85 per square foot — the sixth-lowest asking rent across the top 25 U.S. office markets.

Despite the market’s weak fundamentals, electronics company Littelfuse is relocating its headquarters to the distressed Riverway office complex in Rosemont. This complex faced a $115 million foreclosure lawsuit last summer, the largest ever filed against a suburban Chicago office. Littelfuse will occupy 53,000 square feet in the Riverway complex by the end of the year.

Typically, lenders try to sell distressed properties rather than invest in renovations and leasing efforts. However, with falling demand and reduced property prices, some lenders are opting to play the long game to recover some of the lost value.

Year-to-date through April, Chicago logged $208 million in office sales at an average price of $81 per square foot. Next up, the Twin Cities saw $177 million in closed office deals at an average of $163 per square foot, while Detroit recorded a small volume of $43 million, with properties trading at $76 per square foot.

Looking at construction activity, none of the Midwestern markets saw new construction starts in 2024. Nonetheless, as of April, Chicago had 1.03 million square feet under construction, accounting for 0.3% of its inventory. Meanwhile, Detroit had 524,000 square feet underway, equal to 0.4% of the market's stock. The Twin Cities had only 35,666 square feet under development in April.

Southern Markets: Heavy Development in Recent Years Continues to Put Upward Pressure on Vacancy Rates in Texas Markets

In the South, markets with a high concentration of financial jobs experienced the largest increases in office vacancy rates. For example, office availabilities in Dallas rose by 390 basis points to 21.1% year-over-year in April — the third highest in the nation. Similarly, vacancy rates in Charlotte increased by 380 basis points to 15.6% over the same period but remained well below the 18.3% national average.

Overall, the highest vacancy rate in the Southern region was recorded in Houston at 23.6%, followed by Austin at 22.4%. Despite the Lone Star State's early reopening after the pandemic and a surge in corporate relocations driving return-to-office movements, Houston, Austin and Dallas still have some of the largest vacancies among the top 25 U.S. office markets.

South Regional Highlights

The rise in vacancies, despite healthy economic fundamentals, can be attributed to extensive development in recent years. As of April, Dallas had the third-largest new supply pipeline in the country by square footage, with 4.9 million square feet under construction, representing 1.8% of the metro's existing inventory.

Austin followed with 4.1 million square feet under development, equal to 4.4% of its stock. Across the Texas Triangle, Houston had the lowest new supply pipeline as of April, with 1.7 million square feet underway, accounting for 0.7% of its inventory.

Washington, D.C., led the Southern markets in terms of sales, with $937 million in closed office deals through April. Dallas was next, with office transactions totaling $357 million through the first four months of the year. Meanwhile, Austin led the region in sale prices, with properties trading at an average of $401 per square foot. Washington, D.C., and Miami followed with average prices of $345 per square foot and $279 per square foot, respectively.

Miami remained the most expensive office market in the South in terms of asking rents, closing April with a $49 per square foot average. Austin ($42.25 per square foot) and Washington, D.C. ($40.59 per square foot) followed with asking rents above the $37.66 national average. In contrast, Orlando ($24.84) and Dallas ($28.56) recorded the lowest rates in the region.

Northeastern Markets: Manhattan Leads the Region in Sales with Just $290 Million in Closed Office Deals

Four months into the year, sales activity in the Northeast remained slow, with only $884 million in office deals closed across the region’s leading markets. Manhattan led with $290 million in transactions, followed by New Jersey with $280 million. Boston saw $223 million in closed office deals, while Philadelphia logged just $92 million in transactions year-to-date through April.

As a major life science hub, Boston continues to experience higher development activity than any other market in the U.S. As of April, the metro area had 13.9 million square feet of office space under construction, representing 5.6% of its inventory. Although Boston's development pipeline decreased by 8% compared to the same period last year, when it accounted for 6.1% of inventory, it remains significantly higher on a percentage-of-stock basis than the national pipeline of 1.2%.

Northeast Regional Highlights

Despite being a life science hub, Boston saw a 230-basis point increase in vacancy rates, marking the second-largest uptick in availability after Philadelphia’s 280-basis point rise. At the same time, Manhattan’s office vacancy rate grew by 80 basis points year-over-year in April, while New Jersey saw a 150-basis point increase.

Manhattan continued to post the steepest asking rent in the U.S., closing April at $69.72 per square foot. Following Manhattan, Boston was the second-most expensive office market in the Northeast, with an average asking rent of $46.62 per square foot. Meanwhile, New Jersey's and Philadelphia's rents were $35.40 per square foot and $31.88 per square foot, respectively.

Office-Using Employment: Employment Declines in the Information Sector

Office-using sectors of the labor market lost 6,000 jobs in the month of April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The information sector lost 8,000 workers, and professional and business services lost 4,000. Financial activities were the only office-using sector that grew in April, adding 6,000 workers on the month. Office-using employment has been stagnant during the past year, growing only 0.4% in the past 12 months. The annual growth rate has not topped 1% since last June. The information sector has been the worst performer of the bunch, declining 1.3% over the past 12 months.

Methodology

This report covers office buildings 25,000 square feet and above. CommercialEdge subscribers have access to more than 14,000,000 property records and 300,000 listings for a continually growing list of markets.

CommercialEdge collects listing rate and occupancy data using proprietary methods.

Listing Rates — Listing Rates are full-service rates or “full-service equivalent” for spaces that were available as of the report period. CommercialEdge uses aggregated and anonymized expense data to create full-service equivalent rates from triple-net and modified gross listings. Expense data is available to CommercialEdge subscribers. National average listing rate is for the top 50 markets covered by CommercialEdge.

Vacancy — The total square feet vacant in a market, including subleases, divided by the total square feet of office space in that market. Owner-occupied buildings are not included in vacancy calculations.

A and A+/Trophy buildings have been combined for reporting purposes.

Stage of the supply pipeline:

Planned — Buildings that are currently in the process of acquiring zoning approval and permits but have not yet begun construction.

Under Construction — Buildings for which construction and excavation has begun.

Office-Using Employment is defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as including the sectors Information, Financial Activities, and Professional and Business Services. Employment numbers are representative of the Metropolitan Statistical Area and do not necessarily align exactly with CommercialEdge market boundaries.

Sales volume and price-per-square-foot calculations for portfolio transactions or those with unpublished dollar values are estimated using sales comps based on similar sales in the market and submarket, use type, location and asset ratings, sale date and property size.

Year-to-date metrics and data include the time period between January 1 of the current year through the month prior to publishing the report.

Market boundaries in the CommercialEdge office report coincide with the ones defined by the CommercialEdge Markets Map and may differ from regional boundaries defined by other sources.

Jackson Holtz UW News

University of Washington President Ana Mari Cauce announced Wednesday that she will step down from her leadership role at the conclusion of her second five-year term in June 2025 — a transition that has been planned for several years with the UW Board of Regents — and return to her faculty position. In her upcoming final year in office, Cauce said she is committed to advancing the work of the UW and ensuring a smooth transition.

Cauce’s career at the UW began in 1986, when she was hired as an assistant professor of psychology. Her rise through the university shattered one glass ceiling after another: from department chair — first in American Ethnic Studies and later in Psychology — to dean of the College of Arts & Sciences, then provost before being selected as interim president and named the UW’s 33rd president in 2015. She became the first woman, first Latina, and first openly gay person to serve as president.

Beyond these historic firsts, the impact of her presidency touched all corners of campus life, enhancing access to higher education for students, advancing research and patient care, uniting disciplines to address global challenges, and fostering the UW’s relationships with communities near and far. Cauce also championed the Husky Promise, expanding access to higher education for all eligible students in Washington, leading to record increases in enrollment along with increasingly diverse classes.

“Ana Mari Cauce is an outstanding president, who has led the UW through some of the most tumultuous times in its history. She has advanced the University’s public mission through partnerships with legislators, civic leaders, and the philanthropic community,” David Zeeck, Chair of the UW Board of Regents said in a statement on behalf of the Board. “Few university presidents now serve 10 years. The University has been fortunate to have Ana Mari in this position since 2015.”

The Regents will share details about the search for a successor in the weeks to come.

While president, Cauce led the university during the COVID-19 pandemic, switching to remote learning to ensure continuous, high-quality instruction, and she maintained a laser focus on the student experience at the UW while navigating tense challenges that often reflected the national mood around race, social justice and global events. As provost, she introduced the Husky Promise, which covers tuition at the UW for Washington residents who need it most, and she partnered with leaders at the state’s other universities and colleges to advocate for the Washington College Grant, one of the most generous financial aid programs in the nation.

Under her leadership, the UW has seen massive growth in its work toward advancing research and patient care, including the opening of the Center for Behavioral Health & Learning, joining the Weill Neurohub, opening the Brotman Baty Institute and the Garvey Institute for Brain Health Solutions, and expanding the Institute for Protein Design. She oversaw the establishment of the UW School of Medicine-Gonzaga University Regional Health Partnership, and the formalizing of the UW’s partnership with Fred Hutch Cancer Center.

And Cauce took decisive action in the ever-changing world of college athletics, including moving to the Big Ten Conference to create more opportunity for UW student-athletes to continue to compete in and win national championships.

“While I never imagined that my path would lead me here when I arrived as an assistant professor almost 40 years ago, the chance to lead this great public university has been an immense honor and a wonderful experience. I’m deeply grateful to be part of this incredible community that creates so much positive impact in the world,” Cauce said.

Raised in Miami after emigrating with her family from Cuba at the age of 3, Cauce earned a bachelor’s degree in English and psychology from the University of Miami and a Ph.D. in psychology, with a concentration in child clinical and community psychology, from Yale University.

She’s been widely recognized for her teaching and scholarship, earning the UW’s 1999 Distinguished Teaching Award, being elected to the American Academy of Arts & Sciences in 2020 and the National Academy of Medicine in 2022.

Cauce said she plans to use the next year to shore up support for higher education in the Legislature, work to encourage civil discourse and learning across differences, advance interdisciplinary research and teaching, break down traditional academic silos, and ensure a smooth transition to the Big Ten.

“The UW is a world leader in providing access to excellence for students and discovery and innovation that serves communities around the world,” Cauce said. “My focus now and in the year ahead is to ensure that we continue to serve that public mission and create positive change for future generations.”

What others are saying:

“I am deeply grateful for Ana Mari’s leadership and friendship during her tenure as UW president. Ana Mari will depart with a long list of accomplishments that have strengthened our world-class university. Among the many, I especially appreciate her work to grow our Clean Energy Institute which has provided such an economic boost to our state and is helping new businesses take root all over the state, and her support for our incredible new, first-of-its-kind Center for Behavioral Health and Learning. She brought a refreshing change from the days when I was cut from the UW basketball team. I wish Ana Mari the best of luck in all her upcoming endeavors.” — Washington Gov. Jay Inslee

“President Ana Mari Cauce’s staunch advocacy for women and underrepresented communities in STEM will have lasting impacts on future generations of alumni to come. Under her leadership, the University of Washington doubled the Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science & Engineering and secured massive federal, state, and private investment to support the next generation of innovators in semiconductor manufacturing and quantum computing. We owe Dr. Cauce a debt of gratitude for all she has done for UW to continue its legacy in producing world-class problem solvers.” — U.S. Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.)

“Ana Mari Cauce’s record at the University of Washington is that of a champion for the university, its students, and its home city, continuously growing as a leader from faculty to administrator to a nationally recognized and respected university president. For me, as mayor, and for my wife, as a former regent, it has been an honor to work with someone who is so passionate about the University of Washington, someone who is such an effective advocate for our cherished alma mater, and someone we are also lucky to call a friend.” — Seattle Mayor Bruce Harrell

“From day one of her presidency of the University of Washington, Ana Mari Cauce asked a vitally important question — ‘What can the UW do to help the people and places you represent?’ Over the years, on project after project, in community after community, Ana Mari and her team stepped up to make a difference — not only for UW students but for the entire state. She consistently showed the profound impact of higher education and innovation. I’m grateful for her leadership and partnership, and I look forward to what she will continue to do for the UW during her final year as President.” — Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.)

“Thank you to President Ana Mari Cauce for her years of service to the University of Washington and our entire state. Her tremendous leadership has made a lasting impact both on and off campus. And she has helped make important progress on expanding access to higher education and advancing research and innovation.” — Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.)

“I have always appreciated that Ana Mari is transparent, clear minded and principled in ensuring the UW is serving the state of Washington and that she believes 100% in our public university working for the people and the common good. She believes diversity is necessary for everyone to achieve academic excellence and for the UW’s public engagement, and her authentic connections with students, faculty, staff and the broader community have been vital in helping the university navigate its most difficult challenges.” — Alexes Harris, UW sociology professor and Faculty Regent

“Throughout her tenure, President Cauce has been a skilled relationship-builder, a champion for student success, and a strong advocate for the importance of public universities like the University of Washington. On behalf of the UW Foundation Board, we are grateful for her exemplary leadership these past 10 years. The University of Washington has reached august levels under President Cauce’s leadership, and while we continue to strive, we must acknowledge that this university has never been viewed so highly worldwide. We are all looking forward to walking alongside her as we continue to advocate for the UW in the year ahead.” — Ken Denman, UW Foundation Board chair

“As a proud UW Tacoma alumnus and veteran, it has been a privilege to work alongside President Cauce and witness her commitment to engaging students and alumni from all three campuses. Under her leadership, she has prioritized listening to alumni voices here in Washington, as well as around the world. We appreciate all she has done to build a strong UW community, bringing us closer to the university and to one another.” — Joe M. Davis II, ‘16, University of Washington Alumni Association Board President

“It is a privilege to work with President Ana Mari Cauce. During her presidency, which will span a decade when she completes her term next year, she has led the University of Washington through several years of unprecedented challenges for higher education. The hallmark of her leadership is her profound commitment to the students, faculty, staff and alumni of the UW, where she has served 38 years as a faculty member and in various leadership roles, including department chair, dean, provost and president. Her remarkable legacy is apparent in the university’s tremendous success in research, education and service and also in the lives of thousands of the UW community members she touched.” — Barbara R.

417,Using Git with VS Code,https://dx.appirio.com/vcs-git/git-with-vs-code/,,"Using Git with VS Code

Integrated Git support is one of the great features of Visual Studio Code. Git allows you to track your work, move back and forth between versions, and work on different branches at the same time. Visual Studio Code supports Git by default, which means you don't have to install any packages or extensions to use it. The Side Bar contains a separate Git View you can quickly open by clicking on the Git icon in the View Bar.

Initialize Your Repository¶

If your workspace isn't yet tracked by Git, first you need to initialize a new repository. To do so, click on the Initialize Git Repository button in the Git View.

VS Code will create a .git folder inside your workspace (you can't see this from VS Code, as it's a hidden directory, but you can find it in your file manager in the root folder of your project), and it will also add your untracked files to the Side Bar.

Stage Changes¶

After your Git repository is set up, it's time to create your initial commit (a commit is a recorded state of your whole repository you can later move back to). Before committing, you need to add the files you want to track with Git to the staging area, or in other words you need to stage the changes. To stage a file, click the + button that appears when you hover over that file in the Changes section.

After you click on the files you want to stage, Visual Studio Code moves that file from the Changes folder to the Staged Changes folder, that means that now they are in the staging area. If you want to stage all your files at once, click the + button that appears when you hover over the Changes subtitle.

Commit Changes¶

Staged changes are not yet recorded, you also need to commit them, so that later you can have a look at or move back to the current state of your repository. In order to commit the staged changes, you need to add a commit message that describes the changes you made since your previous commit.

Since in this example this will be the initial commit, let's use the not-so-creative ""Initial Commit"" message. Type your commit message into the input bar at the top of the SideBar, and click on the little tick icon. Now you have made your first commit, and the initial state of your repository is recorded.

Your Git working directory is clean, all the changes you made so far are tracked, and your Git View says there are 0 changes (it always compares the current state to your last commit). If you make new changes in your workspace, the new changes will appear again in the SideBar, and you'll need to commit them again once you have made significant changes that you want to record.

In the screenshot below you can see how your code editor looks right after committing.

Review Changes¶

As you proceed with your work, if you are not sure about how the current version compares to your last commit, you can quickly check the differences. In the Git View, you can just double click on the file you want to compare, and VS Code will show the current and previous versions side by side, so you can quickly compare them.

Speaking of reviewing changes, it's also important to notice Visual Studio Code's gutter indicators that annotate changes compared to your previous commit, even when the side-by-side view is not open. VS Code uses 3 kinds of gutter indicators:

A red triangle for every line deletion A green bar for every line addition A blue bar for every line modification

Create Branches¶

Git allows you to easily create and switch between branches. This is useful for experimenting with new solutions as well as to facilitate code reviews using merge requests. We recommend using short-lived feature branches and merge requests to facilitate code reviews and tracking changes in systems like CMC.

In Visual Studio Code, you can create new branches by clicking on the name of the current branch in the bottom left and selecting + Create New Branch . Or you can open the Command palette by hitting Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) , then typing the Git: Create Branch command into the input bar.

We also have a helper command adx git:branch that makes it easier to follow our suggested naming convention.

Checkout Branches¶

To switch between branches, click the name of your current branch in the bottom left and select your new branch from the list shown. Or use the Command palette ( Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P ) and select Git: Checkout to ... .

Use Git Commands from the Command Palette¶

You can access Git commands from the Command Palette ( F1 on Windows and Linux, Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P on Mac) as well. You don't have to do anything else, just type the command Git inside the Command Palette, and you get a dropdown list of the available commands you can quickly choose from.

Advanced Git Operations¶

So far, we have looked at how to use basic Git operations in Visual Studio Code to track our work. VS Studio Code has advanced Git features as well, such as managing remote repositories, merging conflicts, and you can even configure VS Code as your external Git editor.

The Visual Studio Code Marketplace also contains Git-related extensions that can make your Git workflow even more professional.",planning to open new branch

412,Version control basics | dbt Developer Hub,https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/collaborate/git/version-control-basics,4 дня назад,"On this page

Version control basics

When you develop in the command line interface (CLI) or Cloud integrated development environment (IDE), you can leverage Git directly to version control your code. To use version control, make sure you are connected to a Git repository in the CLI or Cloud IDE.

You can create a separate branch to develop and make changes. The changes you make aren’t merged into the default branch in your connected repository (typically named the main branch) unless it successfully passes tests. This helps keep the code organized and improves productivity by making the development process smooth.

You can read more about git terminology below and also check out GitHub Docs as well.

Check out some common git terms below that you might encounter when developing:

Name Definition Repository or repo A repository is a directory that stores all the files, folders, and content needed for your project. You can think of this as an object database of the project, storing everything from the files themselves to the versions of those files, commits, and deletions. Repositories are not limited by user and can be shared and copied. Branch A branch is a parallel version of a repository. It is contained within the repository but does not affect the primary or main branch allowing you to work freely without disrupting the live version. When you've made the changes you want to make, you can merge your branch back into the main branch to publish your changes Checkout The checkout command is used to create a new branch, change your current working branch to a different branch, or switch to a different version of a file from a different branch. Commit A commit is a user’s change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID that allows you to keep a record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made. main The primary, base branch of all repositories. All committed and accepted changes should be on the main branch.



In the Cloud IDE, the main branch is protected. This means you can directly edit, format, or lint files and execute dbt commands in your protected primary git branch. Since the dbt Cloud IDE prevents commits to the protected branch, you can commit those changes to a new branch. Merge Merge takes the changes from one branch and adds them into another (usually main) branch. These commits are usually first requested via pull request before being merged by a maintainer. Pull Request If someone has changed code on a separate branch of a project and wants it to be reviewed to add to the main branch, they can submit a pull request. Pull requests ask the repo maintainers to review the commits made, and then, if acceptable, merge the changes upstream. A pull happens when adding the changes to the main branch. Push A push updates a remote branch with the commits made to the current branch. You are literally pushing your changes into the remote. Remote This is the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server. Remote versions can be connected to local clones so that changes can be synced.

You can perform git tasks with the git button in the Cloud IDE. The following are descriptions of each git button command and what they do:

Name Actions Abort merge This option allows you to cancel a merge that had conflicts. Be careful with this action because all changes will be reset and this operation can't be reverted, so make sure to commit or save all your changes before you start a merge. Change branch This option allows you to change between branches (checkout). Commit A commit is an individual change to a file (or set of files). When you make a commit to save your work, Git creates a unique ID (a.k.a. the ""SHA"" or ""hash"") that allows you to keep record of the specific changes committed along with who made them and when. Commits usually contain a commit message which is a brief description of what changes were made. When you make changes to your code in the future, you'll need to commit them as well. Create new branch This allows you to branch off of your base branch and edit your project. You’ll notice after initializing your project that the main branch is protected.



This means you can directly edit, format, or lint files and execute dbt commands in your protected primary git branch. When ready, you can commit those changes to a new branch. Initialize your project This is done when first setting up your project. Initializing a project creates all required directories and files within an empty repository by using the dbt starter project.

Note: This option will not display if your repo isn't completely empty (i.e. includes a README file).

Once you click Initialize your project, click Commit to finish setting up your project. Open pull request This allows you to open a pull request in Git for peers to review changes before merging into the base branch. Pull changes from main This option is available if you are on any local branch that is behind the remote version of the base branch or the remote version of the branch that you're currently on. Pull from remote This option is available if you’re on the local base branch and changes have recently been pushed to the remote version of the branch. Pulling in changes from the remote repo allows you to pull in the most recent version of the base branch. Reclone Your Repository Reclone your repository directly from the Cloud IDE. You can reset your repository back to a fresh clone from your remote. To do this, click on the bottom right-hand side green Ready text, then click Reclone Repo. Refresh git state This enables you to pull new branches from a different remote branch to your local branch with just one command.

Merge conflicts often occur when multiple users are concurrently making edits to the same section in the same file. This makes it difficult for Git to determine which change should be kept.

Refer to merge conflicts to learn how to resolve merge conflicts.

dbt Cloud implements a global .gitignore file that automatically excludes the following sub-folders from your git repository to ensure smooth operation:

dbt_packages/

logs/

target/



This inclusion uses a trailing slash, making these lines in the .gitignore file act as 'folder wildcards' that prevent any files or folders within them from being tracked by git. You can also specify additional exclusions as needed for your project.

However, this global .gitignore does not apply to dbt Core and dbt Cloud CLI users directly. Therefore, if you're working with dbt Core or dbt Cloud CLI, you need to manually add the three lines mentioned previously to your project's .gitignore file.

It's worth noting that while some git providers generate a basic .gitignore file when the repository is created, these often lack the necessary exclusions for dbt Cloud. This means it's important to ensure you add the three lines mentioned previously in your .gitignore to ensure dbt Cloud operates smoothly.

note dbt Cloud projects created after Dec 1, 2022 — If you use the Initialize dbt Project button in the dbt Cloud IDE to set up a new and empty dbt project, dbt Cloud will automatically add a .gitignore file with the required entries. If a .gitignore file already exists, the necessary folders will be appended to the existing file.

Migrating project from Core to dbt Cloud — Make sure you check the .gitignore file contains the necessary entries. dbt Core doesn't interact with git so dbt Cloud doesn't automatically add or verify entries in the .gitignore file. Additionally, if the repository already contains dbt code and doesn't require initialization, dbt Cloud won't add any missing entries to the .gitignore file.

249,What Do Employees Want From Their Office Space?,https://www.resolutioninteriors.com/what-do-employees-want-from-their-office-space/,,"What Do Employees Want From Their Office Space?

Global attitudes to work have shifted dramatically in the last few years. In the wake of pandemics, social rights issues and fears of a recession on the horizon, things have truly been put in perspective for many of us.

It’s clear then why the national and global workforce are speaking up more and more about what they want to see from their employers. The best businesses up and down the country are making adjustments to their office space planning to ensure they are providing for their workforce’s growing needs and ensuring they can thrive in this new world of work behaviours.

So what do employees want from their office space? What accommodations can be made to make office working fit around today’s workforce?

In truth, these changes don’t have to be drastic. In most cases, a shift in expectations and alterations to existing office spaces can pave the way for a more fulfilled workforce. In this post, we’ve identified four key things that are important to employees that they want from office spaces…

1. Create A Healthier Workspace Through Office Space Planning

During the COVID-19 pandemic, over half of remote workers demonstrated concern about the health and safety issues of being in a shared environment. Whilst we can thankfully say that the pandemic is over, concerns around physical health in the workplace are more prevalent than ever.

Your office space should look after your employee’s physical health and wellbeing. Let’s be clear, this is about more than hand sanitizers and reminders to wash your hands – everything about your office space planning process should consider the wellbeing of your employees.

Here are some important factors to creating a healthier work environment through proper office space planning:

Ensure workspaces are exposed to as much natural light as possible. This has been proven to improve sleep, reduce headaches and prevent eye fatigue.

Incorporate biophilic design into your space. Greenery such as plants remove harmful compounds from the air and release water vapours that reduce respiratory irritation, as well as creating a more appealing work environment.

Look at increasing the space between employee workstations around the office. This works to promote movement and taking essential breaks, as well as creating a more comfortable working environment.

Ensure that all office equipment is ergonomic, where possible. Adjustable equipment should be kept in the right positions for employees to avoid injuries and strains caused by prolonged periods of poor positioning. Carry out a simple DSE assessment to assess your current equipment.

Install a quality ventilation system which increases the flow of clean air in the office space, helping to prevent the circulation of germs around the building.

2. Using Office Space Planning To Promote Collaboration

Collaboration in the workplace has always been fundamental. However, those that have been working from home more frequently in the past few years, often cite they are craving that in-person teamwork element – which cannot be replicated when at home.

With 58% of employees seeking hybrid working patterns, it’s clear that the power of collaboration and socialisation remains vital to the current workforce. Video meeting software such as Zoom and Teams has seen a monumental rise in active users since the pandemic, however, the virtual solutions haven’t quite filled the gap.

The ability to collaborate in person will likely be the selling point of your office for employees who have become accustomed to remote working. For this to work you not only need to have meeting spaces in your office – ensure that the office layout facilitates your teams working with one another, this can be achieved by placing teams near one another based on inter-dependencies or creating communal spaces that are comfortable and modern such as staff rooms and kitchens.

By investing the time to understand exactly what your employees need, you can make sure to deliver it. For example, whilst your board members and management teams may need large meeting tables for everyone to gather at, your wider workforce may prefer informal cosy environments where small groups can work in a relaxed setting.

The key to developing a great space for collaboration starts with developing a solid understanding of how your employees work best.

Find out how we created a unique workspace for McColls Head Office that met the needs of all of their employees.

3. Planning Quiet Spaces For Your Office

This might appear to contradict the previous point, but in truth, the best offices accommodate both ends of the spectrum. The ideal office provides workers with collaborative spaces as well as areas where they can go to focus or work in isolation.

Whilst working from home many of us have discovered the impact of fewer distractions, with more time alone having a positive effect on output and productivity. This led to many employees feeling more productive and focused on their work.

Listening to your workers here is essential. To encourage office working, develop a space that provides them with the same level of focus they can achieve at home when necessary.

A great way to approach this is to have other spaces around the office that employees can use to work at besides their main desk where there may be conversations, emails and calls coming in frequently.

Pods, workbenches, private offices and seating areas are all great options for focused work areas – but as with your collaborative spaces, you need to find the solution that will work best for your employees and office culture.

You may be surprised how many workers today are craving the combination of home and office working. In fact, a staggering 30% of remote workers reported experiencing burnout during the pandemic since there was little separation between work and home life. By incorporating spaces to focus within your office you can provide the same productive environment that workers crave while creating boundaries that have positive effects on mental health.

4. Flexible Work & Office Space Planning

While there have been drawbacks to working from home, there have been undeniable benefits for many employees including reduced commuting costs, more time with their families and the ability to work more flexible hours.

The two most named benefits of working from home is flexible scheduling and saving time on commuting.

Accounting for flexibility in your office space planning will help your workforce feel heard and comfortable. Small changes such as installing bicycle racks for those that dislike commuting on public transport can be the difference between retaining or losing a worker in the long-term.

Nearly half of remote workers are concerned that office working results in less flexibility and multiple surveys have even found that employees would consider leaving their jobs if flexible working was completely taken off the table.

The majority of employees would like to work part-time in the office with the ability to work remotely as and when they want or need to. This means that your office not only has to work well for those who are in the space, but also for those who are not.

Think about how you can maintain the collaborative atmosphere with employees working remotely – are your meeting rooms set up to accommodate remote and in-person workers with the right tech set up?

Consider Your Entire Workforce

Flexibility means more than remote or in-person working. One of the biggest benefits reported has been that employees can work different hours to their peers without causing disruptions.

During your office space planning, consider how your office space works for those who may keep different hours to most – is the kitchen next to the main working area making it loud and disruptive for those who work during the lunch hour? Is the lighting suitable for long work periods in the evenings or winter months when there is less natural light coming in through windows?

Your office won’t work for flexible workers if they feel like the space hasn’t been designed with them in mind.

Along this same vein, the workstations you create should accommodate flexible workers. For some, a permanent designated desk can make them feel pressured to come into the office more frequently than they’d like whereas hot desks still provide them with a workstation but without the strings attached. In contrast, a hot desk that does not have the right tech set up to support a frictionless operation will create frustration and deter flexible workers from utilising the office.

Ultimately, providing an office space that truly accommodates your employees is all about knowing what your employees want and need from a day at work.

270,What Does An Office Relocation Entail? A Professional Guide,https://www.modernoffice.co.nz/blog/what-does-an-office-relocation-entail/,,"As a business owner, there may come a time when you decide it's time to relocate your office. Whether it's to gain more space, be in a more convenient location for your employees and clients, or simply to upgrade your company's image, an office relocation is a major undertaking. In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at what an office relocation entails, including the planning process, the logistics of the move, and what you can do to make sure it goes as smoothly as possible.

Planning for an office relocation can take several months, and it's important to start the process as soon as possible so that you have enough time to properly prepare. Start by creating a detailed plan that outlines all the tasks that need to be completed before, during, and after the move. This should include things like packing up equipment and supplies, notifying clients and vendors, and arranging for transportation and logistics.

Once you have a plan in place, it's time to start getting everything ready for the move itself. This involves packing up all of your office equipment and supplies, which can take several days or even weeks depending on the size of your office and the amount of equipment you have. This is a great chance to declutter and remove old equipment and files that you no longer need. Make sure to label everything clearly so that it's easy to unpack and set up in your new space.

When it comes to the actual move itself, you'll need to arrange for transportation and logistics. This may involve hiring a moving company or renting a truck, depending on the size of your office and the amount of equipment you have. Make sure to get quotes from multiple companies before making a decision, and ask for referrals from other businesses who have gone through an office relocation to ensure that you're working with a reputable company.

Once you've moved everything to your new office, it's time to unpack and get settled in. Depending on the size of your office and the amount of equipment you have, this can take several days or even weeks. It's important to have a plan in place for setting up your new space, including things like where to put desks and other furniture, how to organize your files and supplies, and where to place equipment like computers and phones.

An office relocation is a major undertaking, but with the right planning and preparation, it can be a smooth, stress-free process. Start by creating a detailed plan that outlines all the tasks that need to be completed, and allow plenty of time for packing, transportation, and setting up your new space. Additionally, make sure to do your research and choose a reputable moving company to ensure that everything goes smoothly on the day of the move. With these tips in mind, your office relocation can be a success, and your business can continue to thrive in its new location.

691,What Is A Strategy Map?,https://www.clearpointstrategy.com/blog/what-is-a-strategy-map,18 мая 2024 г.,"During your strategic planning process, there are a lot of puzzle pieces to fit together. How do you identify the right goals for your organization? How can you ensure they are interconnected?

This is where the Balanced Scorecard's strategy map comes into play.

A strategy map is your fail-safe to help you work through your organizationâs priorities and goals in the proper order. Itâs an incredibly effective and useful tool to put in play during both the strategic planning and execution processes. In this article, weâll give a strategy map definition, walk through how to build a map, and explain why itâs so important to your strategy.

What Is a Strategy Map (& Do You Need One)?

A strategy map is a visual representation of the things your organization must do well in four areas (also called âperspectivesâ) in order to execute its strategy successfully. The map is created during the strategic planning process, and is used as a primary reference material during periodic strategy check-in and review meetings.

The four areas represented on a strategy map were developed by Doctors Robert S. Kaplan and David P. Norton as part of their Balanced Scorecard framework for strategic planning and management. They include:

Finance

Customer

Internal Processes

People/Learning & Growth

The top two perspectives can be characterized as âwhat weâre getting,â while the bottom two are more about âwhat weâre doing.â Another way to explain this is that the bottom two perspectives are the leading goals and activities and the top perspectives are the lagging goals and indicators.

While a map can be read from top down or bottom up, the âstoryâ of the strategy typically will flow better when read from the bottom up because what you do directly influences what you get.



Read a strategy map from the bottom up.

Do You Need a Strategy Map?

A map is one the main components of the Balanced Scorecard methodology. That said, you can get by without building oneâbut we donât recommend it.

âDuring the planning process, the structure of the four perspectives forces you to think through what youâre trying to accomplish and how youâll get there.

âStrategy maps help you identify key goals and uncover gaps in your strategy before you set anything in stone and initiate execution. These maps also help display how intangible company resourcesâincluding employee knowledge and customer relationshipsâgenerate strategic value.

In the long term, you can also use strategy maps to test methods of achieving your goals.

For example, if you think a certain customer management process or internal training will create more value and drive additional revenue, you can implement the tactic to test the theory. A year later during your annual strategic review, you can assess the implementation and progress toward the goal, adjusting your strategy if needed. In short, your strategy map helps you track progress and ensure alignment as you move through the execution phases.

Perhaps most importantly, strategy maps give employees an understanding of how their jobs contribute to top-level, strategic goals. When teams know their efforts are contributing to the organizationâs overall goals, itâs a huge productivity driver and morale booster.

How To Build A Strategy Map

As noted above, strategy mapping is part of the larger process of creating a Balanced Scorecard. To make an accurate map, youâll need to do a bit of planning first. The steps to building a strategy map are as follows:

1. Assess or develop your organizationâs foundational strategic elements

To guide your future direction, make sure there is consensus among your leadership team around your organizationâs mission and vision. These important concepts express your reason for being and act as a compass paving the way forward.

Your scorecardâand by extension, your mapâwill translate these concepts into performance objectives. Youâll also want to discuss your companyâs value propositionâhow you do things differently, better, or more efficiently than your competitors. Together, these elements will clarify your direction for the future.

2. Formulate your strategy

What set of activities will you need to undertake to achieve your desired future? What areas do you need to excel in? What levers can you pull to drive change? Most importantly, how will the activities you choose to do differ from those of your competitors? Take these questions into consideration as you determine your approach to make your vision come to life.

3. Create your strategy map

Now itâs time to craft succinct, precise objective statements for each of the four perspectives on the strategy map. If this is your first strategy map, limit your objectives to 15 or fewer to ensure youâre focusing on the most vital drivers of success.

Note that, while you might read a strategy map from the bottom up, you build it from the top down, in this order:

Financial

Itâs standard to use two measures of financial strategy: revenue growth and productivity. For nonprofits and municipalities, your mission would be at the top of your strategy map, not financials.

Customers

The customer value proposition should be at the core of your strategy, which is why it comes directly after the financials (or mission). For-profit companies typically focus on achieving one of these three value propositions:

Product leadership

Customer intimacy

Operational excellence

To effectively map your strategy, you have to decide which of those three is the priorityâitâs unrealistic to weigh them all equally. Making this choice is a big piece of your strategy.

For nonprofits and governments, your beneficiaries or citizens would replace customers and your three value propositions would more likely revolve around serving the needs of those citizens.

Processes

Once your financial and customer perspectives are established, youâll focus on HOW (through what processes) to achieve your financial and customer goals. Most companies are working to improve (if not perfect) internal processes that support these areas of the business:

Fostering growth through innovation and new-market expansion.

Enhancing customer value by improving relationships with existing customers.

Working toward operational excellence.

Creating productive relationships with external stakeholders.

Learning & Growth

Here lies the foundation of the strategy. This perspective outlines the employee skills and knowledge required to make the processes run smoothly, which in turnâ¦

provides value to customers, which in turn...

improves company financials. The specifics of this perspective can vary widely from company to companyâwhat you define as learning and growth is entirely dependent on your goals as outlined in the preceding perspectives.

4. Personalize the strategy map

Part of the mapâs strength is its ability to communicate strategy so effectivelyâa characteristic that can be enhanced by adding some visual appeal. Align it with your companyâs other marketing materials, including colors, logos, and any other brand themes.

Todayâs audiences are accustomed to sophisticated graphics; an attractive map is more likely to catch peopleâs attention and will remain more useful over the long term.

Nonprofits and other mission-driven organizations may also customize the perspectives within the strategy map. The key is to ensure that the map âtells the storyâ of your strategy.

Once youâve completed your map, youâll move on to the final steps of creating a Balanced Scorecard:

Select the right measures. Your scorecard should contain a mix of leading and lagging indicators, all of which will tell you whether youâre accomplishing your goals and on the right track to accomplish future goals.

Launch some initiatives. Decide which projects you need to undertake to achieve your objectives.

Share your strategy with employees and other stakeholders. Create a plan to shout it from the rooftops, letting everyone know where youâre headed, and the role your employees will play in getting there.

Tedâs Take: The Strategy Map In Action

At ClearPoint, weâve helped a lot of mission-driven organizations. I've personally had the good fortune to help many in the Coastal Alabama region, where I grew up. Interestingly, all the organizations we worked with were dealing with similar issues, primarily around transparency and alignment.

This became clear when a friend recommended me to a nonprofit organization. In this case, all the business executives involved had great ideas and a real concern about increasing their organization's effectiveness. They tended to agree with each other in meetings, but they kept talking about different aspects of the strategy and not connecting their opinions with others in the room.

It was as if they were good at expressing their ideas, but they didn't see how those ideas connected across the priorities, which caused frustration. In addition, it seemed that the board and leadership team were not aligned around the mission because they all had different ideas about how to interpret it.

To attack the problem, I introduced the Balanced Scorecard and the strategy map. These tools gave the executives a framework for understanding and organizing the issues when discussing them, allowing everyone to stay focused.

What happened next?

For the organization above, the strategy map allowed the board and executive staff to become much more productive and aligned in their conversations. The organization grew quickly and gained state-wide recognition for their work.

In a small or medium-sized cityâor even a big one with a tight-knit communityâgood ideas catch on fast:

After we introduced the strategy map, the nonprofit started working with its partners to develop strategy maps. I helped develop a map for both an industrial alliance and a healthcare board. Both groups noticed the maps improved their executive team meeting discussions, and made prioritizing and decision-making easier.

After the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, regional leaders formed a council to help determine the priorities, which ranged from environmental to economic to workforce development. What did they choose to help them stay focused and prioritized? You guessed it: a strategy map.

One of the individuals in the councilâs workforce development group was involved in another organization focused on economic development. He thought the map was so helpful, he wanted a strategy map for that organization.

The leader of the environmental organization who participated in the councilâs economic development group was also struggling to organize her board around that organizationâs mission. They, too, embarked on a strategy map. With the development of that map, related nonprofits and government organizations were better able to prioritize and focus their regional planning efforts.

David Norton, one of the creators of the Balanced Scorecard and strategy map, once said (and I'm sure heâs still saying it): ""Before the BSC, there was no common framework or way to talk about strategy."" As this story shows, in a community with active nonprofits and government organizations, there is a strong need for a common framework and a common language.

âIt is very fulfilling to watch workforce development, economic development, environmental, and healthcare organizations use a similar language to set priorities, and communicate their relationships and contributions to making Coastal Alabama a better place to live. All these organizations have a similar mission that relates to increasing the quality of life in the region. Now, with a similar framework, they can see how they all contribute to the common mission, even though they are in different ""businesses."" Think about your community...are all of your government and nonprofit organizations working together?

Strategy Maps In Balanced Scorecard Software

If a strategy map tells the story of where your organization is headed, then Balanced Scorecard software is the tool that brings that strategy story to life. Just like any map, strategy maps are only useful if they are frequently referenced (to help you stay on track) and kept up to date.

While you can build your strategy map using any number of digital tools, you need Balanced Scorecard software to make sure the map retains its value as a strategy execution tool.

Balanced Scorecard software is uniquely suited for supporting strategy execution efforts because it was designed specifically to track the performance of your goal-related activities. Strategy managementâand the data gathering and reporting that goes along with itâcan be challenging for organizations of any size, so itâs important to choose a software that simplifies the process. If youâre in the market for strategy software, review your options with the following in mind:

Users need to be able to see overall progress on strategy execution easily and quickly. Does the software present data in a clear, easy-to-read visual format?

Various stakeholders (not just the CSO) will want to know howâand ifâtheir daily activities are impacting the strategy; Balanced Scorecard software should provide the relevant information to users at a glance. Strategy maps are naturally visual, so your software should be capable of taking that document and building on it for maximum value.

ClearPoint turns your strategy map from a readable document into an interactive one, making it continuously useful for all stakeholders. It lets you upload a PDF or PowerPoint file of the map you created and link each objective to specific data points in ClearPoint.

As those data points change, so do status indicators overlaid on the map, making it reflective of reality at all times. So if your revenue numbers go up during a certain period, a green arrow pointing up automatically appears over that objective; if the numbers go down, a red down arrow will show. Users can then click on those icons to get more detailed information. (See more on that below.)



Users need a way to track all elements of strategy execution, not just high-level objectives. Does the software capture and track all aspects of your strategy, including your measures and projects?

Your high-level objectives are supported by measures, projects, action items, and more. To manage performance successfully, you need to track data associated with all those elements. The software you choose should be able to do that, and link elements together to give a full picture of strategic execution and how the organization is performing across all areas.

ClearPoint lets users track the projects and KPIs supporting your objectives; you can even link them to the objectives on your strategy map so that you always have a high-level view of your entire strategy. You can easily see improvement over time by visiting your strategy map from last month; all historical information is available in the tool. And since not all team members are interested in the same data points, ClearPoint lets you create reports with the relevant elements for different audiences.

Users need to see general and detailed performance data. Does the software have the capability to âdrill downâ more deeply into data?

The high-level view of performance illustrated on strategy maps may be exactly what the leadership team wants to see, but there may be times when they, and other team members, will want to see the layers of data that underlie those status indicators. Balanced Scorecard software should make it easy for everyone to access more granular views of data sets and analysis as needed.

When ClearPoint users click on the status indicators associated with an objective, they can see key data points and supporting information that contribute to performance. For example, if one or more specific projects have been implemented to help achieve an objective, you can drill down to project detail pages to get more information about how those projects are performing individually. This functionality gives users the ability to better understand the data without complicating reporting and data presentation.



The reporting process is time-consuming. Does the software reduce the amount of time you spend gathering data and reporting results?

Data gathering, report preparation, data entryâthese strategy management tasks take time away from execution activities. Many Balanced Scorecard software options track progress on your strategy, but few have bonus features that save you time.

ClearPoint automates the strategy management process to dramatically reduce the time and effort you invest in managing, tracking, and reporting on your strategy. For example, the status icons on your strategy map automatically change to red, yellow, or green based on the performance of your measures and the projects that support them. You can also send your strategy map reports out on a schedule (monthly, quarterly, etc.) so that everyone is on the same page about how your strategy is performing. (Read more about how our automation features help with strategy execution here.)

Strategy maps created in other tools donât always translate well into Balanced Scorecard software. Does the software retain and enhance your mapâs visual appeal?

The most effective strategy maps are informative and attractive. If youâve taken the time to create a well-designed map of your own, you want to be able to use it with your Balanced Scorecard softwareânot be forced to create a strategy map in the software using limited design tools.

With ClearPoint, you can use your exact, professionally drawn (or PowerPoint-created) map inside the software, or create a map consistent with your organizational styleâone that includes a background with your brand colors or shapes, your logo, your design techniques, and more. You can also customize the objectives, measures, and initiatives that appear on it. As a result, the map you create will be on-brand, useful, and inspiring.

If youâre just getting started with strategy mapping, first take a look at some sample strategy maps and learn how you can create your own. Then, give us a shout at ClearPointâweâd love to show you how our software works in conjunction with your new strategy map to keep your organization on track for reaching future goals!

The Strategy Map As A Common Language:Â A Case Study

We have helped a lot of mission-driven organizations. I've had the good fortune to help many in my hometown (home region?) of Coastal Alabama. In a small or medium city, or even a big one with a tight knit community, good ideas catch on fast. What was interesting to me was that all of the organizations we have worked with were dealing with similar issues. The issues are around transparency and alignment.

The boards and leadership teams were not aligned around the mission because they all had different ideas of how to interpret the mission. The strategy map helped get them all on the same page.

It started when a friend recommended me to a nonprofit that focused on Workforce Development. The business executives involved all had great ideas and a real concern about increasing their organization's effectiveness. They tended to agree with each other in meetings, but they kept talking about different things across different parts of the meeting. It was as if they were good at expressing their ideas, but they didn't see how the ideas connected across the priorities, so they were getting frustrated.

We introduced the Balanced Scorecard and the Strategy Map, and the executives had a framework for understanding and organizing the issues when they spoke of them. This allowed the organization to stay focused and start achieving some of their priorities.

In the Workforce Development group was an individual who was involved in an organization focused on Economic Development. The economic development executive thought that the map was so helpful, he wanted a Strategy Map for that organization. This organization had many members of local Chambers of Commerce. It also had an environmental advocate on its team. The map really helped them realize that they had common goals across the different communities and if they entire region grew, then it helped each one of them.

The leader of the Environmental organization that participated in the Economic development group was also struggling with organizing its board around its mission in a clear way. So they quickly embarked on a Strategy Map. With the development of that map, nonprofits and government organizations related to this environmental group were able to prioritize and focus on its regional planning efforts. Of course several of the agencies involved with this organization started considering strategy maps as well.

Then the original Workforce Development group started working with its partners to develop strategy maps. We helped to develop a map for an industrial alliance, and the Executive Director who sat on a healthcare board developed a map for that board on her own. Of course both groups said how much easier it made their executive team meetings and their prioritization, discussions, and decision making.

After the BP Oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, a council was formed to help determine the regional priorities. Of course these priorities ranged from environmental to economic to workforce development. What did they choose to help them stay focused and prioritized? You guessed it by now, a Strategy Map.

I started working for David Norton, one of the creators of the Balanced Scorecard and strategy map, in the 1990s. He said back then, (and I'm sure he is still saying it): ""There is no common framework or way to talk about strategy."" While I agreed with him, I didn't see a need for a common framework when working with for-profit organizations. There is no regulatory body for strategy, and so who cared if one company managed one way and a second company managed a different way.

But in a community with active nonprofits and government organizations, there is a strong need for a common framework and a common language. It is very fulfilling to watch workforce development, economic development, environmental, and healthcare organizations all being able to talk to each other and use a similar language to set priorities and communicate their relationships and their contribution to making Coastal Alabama a better place to live. All of these organizations have a similar mission that relates to increasing the quality of life in the region.

Now, with a similar framework, they can see how each of the organizations contributes to the common mission, even as they are in different ""businesses."" Think about your community...are all of your government and nonprofit organizations working together?

112,What Location to Choose When Looking for a New Office ...,https://www.corporateoffice.my/what-location-to-choose-when-looking-for-a-new-office-space,,"What location to choose when looking for a new office space? This is the question often being asked when we received an enquiry for office space search. Multi-national companies (MNC) usually have some better ideas of what they require in term of office space selection and they can usually zoom in quickly into the available buildings in the desired area. Meanwhile we often see the smaller companies or SMEs undecided on the locations and need to be presented with larger radius of radar before they shortlist the area(s) to focus in.

The commercial office space market in Klang Valley is mainly divided into a few major Central Business District (CBD) in Kuala Lumpur and Petaling Jaya (e.g. KLCC area, KL Sentral, Mid Valley, PJ City Centre) and some suburban local commercial areas (Subang, Puchong, Klang etc.).

When it comes to location selections, obviously different business will have different requirements and is suitable to different locations. Hereby we are going to discuss the FIVE key factors that are most important in the location selection: -

Location of Clients/Customers

The No. 1 consideration when one chooses their business address shall be the location of their clients and customers. Why is this so important? Do you want to stay near to your girlfriend’s house or let her other admirer(s) stay at her next door?

This location factor is most important for businesses such as sales & service centers, which will need central location(s) that is(are) willing to be accessed by customers from all corners of Klang Valley. This is also almost equally important for sales and marketing office, and the locations need to be near their customer base.

The rule of thumb is to locate your business as near client’s office as possible – if there is an anchor client or a group of major client office located in the same area (banking software developer need to near banking district etc.). The business owners will eventually find that any extra expenses to locate in the prime areas, if any, paid off by the extra business generated from the opportunities created to visit and carry out networking activities with your clients.

Location of Employees

For a relocating business or company, existing employees’ home locations are also another important factor especially if the company has a large nos. of employees. Some companies lose staffs when relocating their office and have to do quite some new recruitment to make up the headcount losses. However, the recruitment normally should not be more difficult if the relocation is to move to a more central location.

Of course the employer has to balance the importance between the retention and recruitment factor, and it will be an easier decision if the relocation is to accommodate for a major expansion that will be followed by intensive recruitment plan.

This problem can be minimize by being transparent about the relocation plan, and doing a simple survey among the key staffs before the selected location is being finalized.

Public Transport and Road Accessibility

Public transport will widely increase the accessibility of the employees to commute to work daily. As many are aware, LRT is the most convenient public transport in Klang Valley at the moment due to the best reliability (although there are still complaints on its sporadic breakdowns during peak hours) and a reasonable wide coverage of the population without train interchange (covering both KL & PJ with extensions coming soon).

If the staffs or management members need to travel overseas frequently, the accessibility to airport will be a key consideration, and that is one of the main reasons KL Sentral has attracted many major MNCs to relocate their regional office there.

Proximity to Amenities and Conveniences

For company with frequent visitors from overseas, hotel(s) nearby will be a much value-added amenities. Company located in KLCC, KL Sentral & Mid Valley area will not have any issue on the hospitality availability while this can be an issue for most of the other areas.

Nowadays companies are also looking at factors such as F&B choices availability, banking facilities and conveniences. For the same reason integrated development with shopping mall had become a popular choice.

Right Image for your Business

Some international companies need to be located in an area or in a building that can be recognized internationally, such as KLCC area, KL Sentral etc. Service providers with international clients also are very cautious on the address or road name carried by their business cards.

For small service providers or consultants, the business address becomes one of the first item to present their business image during first meet up with clients. For small business, one of the most cost-saving and effective way to have a prestigious address is to take up a virtual office package in prime office buildings.

Note that the factors discussed above are only those will affect the selection of business location, and there are other factors to be considered when we zoom in the building selections.

In other words, when a firm aims to grow considerably by broadening the scope of one of its business operations in the perspective of customer groups, customer functions and technology alternatives, either individually or jointly, then it follows the Expansion Strategy.

The reasons for the expansion could be survival, higher profits, increased prestige, economies of scale, larger market share, social benefits, etc. The expansion strategy is adopted by those firms who have managers with a high degree of achievement and recognition. Their aim is to grow, irrespective of the risk and the hurdles coming in the way.

The firm can follow either of the five expansion strategies to accomplish its objectives:

Go through the examples below to further comprehend the understanding of the expansion strategy. These are in the context of customer groups, customer functions and technology alternatives.

The baby diaper company expands its customer groups by offering the diaper to old aged persons along with the babies. The stockbroking company offers the personalized services to the small investors apart from its normal dealings in shares and debentures with a view to having more business and a diversified risk.

85,What is Office Space Management ...,https://offispace.sa/knowledge-center/office-space-management/,,"Some of the things that come to mind when thinking about what makes a company successful include skilled workers, well-oiled machinery, and forward-thinking management. Although it may not be immediately apparent, good space planning for the office is crucial to the success of your company over the long term. In light of this, the question arises as to how one may go about maximizing small office space by making the most of its physical space and supplies. To get you started on the path to more effectively managing your company’s office space, we’ve compiled the guide below.

What Is Office Space Management?

The management, control, and monitoring of the physical areas used by the business are referred to as space management in offices. This could mean a single story, several floors, or perhaps many buildings. Everything from office layouts to parking lots to conference rooms to employee break areas is included in your company’s footprint. Space planning office involves several steps, including information gathering, analysis, prediction, and planning.

What Are the Three Key Factors in Space Management?

Below are three major factors to consider when space planning an office.

Careful Planning

Preparation is the key to successful space management. Facility managers (FMs) should work with other divisions and staff members to identify objectives and design the workplace accordingly.

It’s important to note that the specifics of this planning procedure will vary based on the type of workplace that is currently being (or will be) utilized by the organization.

Implementation Using the Necessary Tools

The second fundamental factor of space management is the process of putting into action new layouts, office designs, and strategies while ensuring that the appropriate resources, including technology, are always at hand.

Keep in mind that the purpose of space management is to provide a more enjoyable and productive place to work. FMs must employ suitable technological means to achieve this goal in today’s ever-more-complicated workplaces.

Space Tracking

Finally, the third factor of space management is the ongoing assessment of current space usage to enhance that utilization whenever possible. FMs should initiate data analytics collection for their area. They can then start to create an image of how it is being used. They can use this real-time information to fine-tune and improve their operations.

How Do You Manage a Small Office Space?

The factors listed below will aid in planning an office space.

Being Flexible Is the New Mantra

Get rid of the compartmentalized rooms that serve only one purpose and replace them with a more open plan that can accommodate a variety of tasks. Intelligent space planning that allows for easy adaptation to changing needs is preferable.

Focus On the Choice of Materials

When used in a room, heavy materials can create the appearance of a smaller and more cramped area. To create the impression of more space, choose lighter materials like wood and simple finishes.

Eliminate Disorder and Clutter

Get rid of anything in the workplace that you’re not going to use. Smart devices and clever storage options might help you organize your office’s complex wiring and give the impression that there is more space there.

Merging the Lines of Common Areas

Ensure effective use of communal spaces and make them accessible. When workers need a break from their cramped desks, the company should make sure that the cafeteria and meeting rooms may be used for business as well.

What Is the Objective of Space Management?

The objective of office space management is to streamline processes, so making it possible to implement strategic, scalable optimization strategies that address unique issues related to utilization and functioning and ultimately improve working conditions for everybody involved.

When a company is experiencing rapid expansion, it is critical that the workplace be laid out for maximum productivity. Without a well-designed space, productivity, efficiency, and innovation among workers may suffer.

What Are the Benefits of Space Management?

To keep workers happy and motivated, planning office spaces is essential. Let’s take a look at some of the other advantages of efficient space management.

Massive Savings

A company’s budget may take a serious hit if the office space is improperly organized, leading to higher costs for rent and furnishings. Space planning can assist in creating an office environment that is functional for all workers. You can cut expenses by reducing the number of employees and the amount of idle office space.

Increased Efficiency

If your desk is a mess, your thoughts will be, too. And the same is true for the workplace. It’s easier for workers to get work done when they arrive at an office that is well-organized and free of unnecessary clutter and dead space.

Continuous Development

The potential for continuous development is a less visible advantage of office space management. With a space management plan in place, you won’t just design your office once but instead will actively seek out methods to make it better for your staff as their demands evolve. If you need access to information about the utilization of your office space, space management tools will be an invaluable asset.

Increased Flexibility

Office space standards and guidelines frequently undergo revision. Depending on the day, your office could be open to anywhere from 10 to 100 employees. Having a space management plan in place can help you adapt quickly to new circumstances and make room for necessary adjustments in the office.

Cut Down on the Workload of Office Managers

Effectively managing your team’s physical environment can help everyone save time and effort. No longer will they need to assign desks or rearrange furniture at the last minute manually. With more reliable forecasting and office space planning resources, they can prioritize employee happiness and security.

Thriving Corporate Culture

Culture at an organization is the sum of its employees’ daily interactions. Happy hours, team-building exercises, and productive brainstorming sessions can all be found right at your office. These conversations are vital to the development of a productive and cohesive workplace. Providing a suitable location for such gatherings will go a long way toward fostering a sense of shared identity and pride among your staff.

Why Space Management Is Important for a Business

The following are some of the reasons why businesses prioritize space optimization.

Cost Control

The majority of businesses and large organizations need a substantial amount of office space to house their administration, research, customer service, and other crucial business operations. It is especially vital to maintain optimal space use if your real estate portfolio consists of many buildings with offices scattered across multiple floors to cut or avoid major operational expenditures.

Waste Minimization

The world is investing more and more in environmental and CO2-reducing measures, so it makes sense that proactive space management in the workplace would help to reduce resource consumption and better position your facility for the future.

Engagement of Employees

Investing in your workplace’s infrastructure is not just good asset management from a financial perspective, but it can also have a profound effect on your staff’s morale and productivity. Managing your office space strategically will help you create a more pleasant and productive workplace, which will, in turn, motivate your current staff and appeal to potential new hires.

Conclusion

The success of your company depends in large part on how well you manage your office space. Maximizing the use of available space has multiple benefits for a business, including increased efficiency and lower operating costs.

We assume that you have set up your working environment and checked out your mizer fork to your local computer as described in the section Setting up working environment in the mizer developer guide. If you have not yet read that section, please do so now and follow all the instructions there before continuing with this tutorial.

Creating a branch Initially you will be on the “master” branch of your repository. The code in this branch of your repository is a perfect copy of the code in the master branch of the main mizer repository at https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer. You should always keep it that way and not commit any changes to this branch. You should do all our development work in branches that have been branched off from the master branch. When you start working on a feature or on a bug fix, start a new branch with a name suggestive of the feature or fix. In this example, where you will be adding your info to the list of people who have set up a fork of mizer, let’s call the branch “add_my_info”. To create the new branch, first make sure you have selected the master branch on the “Switch branch” dropdown in RStudio Git panel and then click the button to the left of that dropdown. To create the new branch, first make sure you have selected the master branch on the “Switch branch” dropdown in RStudio Git panel and then click the button to the left of that dropdown. In the dialog box enter the name for your new branch: “add_my_info”. Leave the remote as “origin” and make sure the “Sync branch with remote” checkbox is ticked. This means that the new branch will be created not only on your local repository but also on your GitHub repository. Click “Create”. You are now on a new branch in your repository, but so far this branch contains only exactly the same content as the master branch that you have branched off from.

Editing a file Next you will make an edit to a file. In the “Files” tab in RStudio, navigate to the “vignette” subdirectory and click on the name “developer_vignette.Rmd”. That will open that file in the Source editor pane. That file is the source file for this developer guide, written in R Markdown format. A good way to navigate within files is to use the document outline which will be displayed when you hit the right-most icon on the editor pane toolbar. A good way to navigate within files is to use the document outline which will be displayed when you hit the right-most icon on the editor pane toolbar. You will find the subheading “People with a mizer fork” towards the bottom of the outline. Clicking on it will move to the corresponding section of the file. You can now add another bullet point with your name and interests. This is an R Markdown file, so you can compile it by clicking on the “Knit” button on the editor toolbar. This will also save your changes to the disk. After a short while the resulting html file will be displayed in an RStudio viewer which will allow you to check the formatting of your bullet point. If you had made changes to the actual R code of mizer, then you would of course also rebuild mizer from that new code by clicking “Install and Restart” on the “Build” pane of RStudio to test it, and would in particular run the automated unit tests by hitting Ctrl+Shift+T.

Committing your changes So far you have only saved your changes to your local disc, but have not yet committed it to your local repository. To do that you click on the “Commit” button on the toolbar in the “Git” pane in RStudio: This will pop up a screen like the following: So far you have only saved your changes to your local disc, but have not yet committed it to your local repository. To do that you click on the “Commit” button on the toolbar in the “Git” pane in RStudio:This will pop up a screen like the following: The blue M to the left of the file vignettes/developer_vignette.Rmd indicates that this file has been modified on your hard disc. The files with the question mark are files that are in the project directory but not part of the repository. You now tick the file that you want to commit to the repository. In the above screenshot the file vignettes/developer_vignette.Rmd has already been selected and as a consequence, the lower half of the pop-up window shows the modifications that have been made in the file. You should see your additions in green. At the top right of the pop-up window you enter the commit message that will allow you and others later to understand the purpose of this commit. It is really useful to put a meaningful message here. The first time you make a commit to a new branch, you may want to write an extended commit message that explains what the new branch is for. When you are happy with everything, hit the “Commit” button. Now your changes are forever saved in the history of your local repository.

Pushing and pulling So far you have only committed your changes to the local repository on your computer. The changes have not yet been synchronised with your repository on GitHub. To do that, you click on the “Push” button on the toolbar of the “Git” pane, the one that looks like an up arrow. A window will pop up that will confirm if that push worked alright. You can then close that window. After you have pushed your changes, you will be able to see them also on GitHub. If you go to the home page of your GitHub repository you will see a comment that you made a commit a little while ago: After you have pushed your changes, you will be able to see them also on GitHub. If you go to the home page of your GitHub repository you will see a comment that you made a commit a little while ago: It may be that you have several computers on which you work an you can have a local repository on every one of them. In that scenario, it may be that you have pushed changes onto your GitHub repository from another computer. You will then not be able to push your new changes from your current computer until you have pulled those changes onto your current computer. You do that by hitting the “Pull” button that looks like a down arrow right next to the “Push” button. That will incorporate any changes from GitHub into your local repository and this will generally go smoothly. Only in the case where you have edited the same lines of the same file on different machines can you run into conflicts that git can not resolve automatically. In order to avoid such conflicts, you should pull and push frequently.

Making a pull request Once a feature is developed and tested, you will want to merge it into the master branch of the upstream repository at https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer. You can however not push your changes directly to that repository. Instead you create a GitHub pull request. This will then get a code review from another mizer developer before one of the developers with write access to the main repository merges your changes. Due to this extra code review before any changes are integrated into the core mizer code, you do not have to be hesitant with making pull requests. In case there is anything wrong with your changes, you will get friendly feedback from other developers. You can then make more changes and commit them to the same branch and your pull request will automatically get updated. The pull request is easy to create using the GitHub web interface: Go to the home page of your forked repository on GitHub Select the branch via the “Branch” drop-down. Click the “New pull request” button next to that drop-down. Go ahead an create a pull request for your “add_my_info” branch. Once your pull request has been reviewed and accepted by a developer and your changes have thus been merged into the upstream master branch, you can delete your development branch. There is a delete button on GitHub to delete a branch (for example on the page listing all your branches). You also need to delete the branch separately in your local repository by issuing git branch -d add_my_info from the terminal, where `add_my_info’ is the name of the development branch. In addition you may want to tell your local repository that the remote branch has disappeared as well: git remote prune origin Otherwise it will stay in RStudio’s list of remote branches.

Merging from upstream Once your pull request, or any pull request by anyone else with a mizer fork, has been merged into the upstream repository, the master branch in your fork is no longer in sync with the upstream master branch. So you will want to merge those upstream changes into our master branch. To do that you can use the “Terminal” pane in RStudio, where you execute the following git commands: git fetch upstream git checkout master git merge upstream/master Again, unless you locally changed the same line in the same file that someone else changed in the upstream repository, the merging will be automatic. You should then push the merged master branch back to your GitHub repository with the “Push” button. If you get an error when attempting to fetch from upstream then the upstream repository may not yet have been set for your repository. You can check with git remote -v If that does not list an upstream, then execute the command git remote add upstream https://github.com/sizespectrum/mizer.git and then try the above again. The first time you go through all the above steps, you will think that you will never grow to like git. What a lot of fuss. What a circuitous route for your change to make it into the master branch of your GitHub repository: from your editor to your from your harddrive into your development branch in your local repository via Commit from you local repository to your GitHub repository via Push from your GitHub repository to the main mizer repository via Pull Request from the main mizer repository to you local master branch via merge from your local master branch to the master branch of your GitHub repository via Push But this is the best system software developers have come up with to allow many people to collaborate on the same code. You may have more than one development branch because you may be working on several features at the same time or some of your features are still waiting to have their pull request merged. In that case, after merging the upstream changes into our master branch, you may also want to merge them from your master branch into some of your development branches. For that you just go to the development branch and do git merge master",planning to open new branch

Geneva, May 2, 2024

PR/2024/916

A new WIPO report probes the intersection of human innovation, economic diversification and industrial policy and finds that the key to sustainable growth for countries is to focus policy making on developing local innovation capabilities.

The biennial World Intellectual Property Report (WIPR) “Making Innovation Policy Work for Development” documents a recent resurgence in industrial policy making, including in many developing and least developed countries, aimed at ensuring a wide and growing economic structure base - and the innovation, creativity and technology required to achieve it.

The WIPR establishes a novel methodology that maps 20 years of innovation capabilities across 150-plus WIPO member states, pinpointing how different countries have boosted their economic diversification in areas of technology, science and exports. Through this, the WIPR results help governments design their policies in a highly dynamic economic and political environment.

We hope this report will guide policymakers across the world on how to leverage innovation for improved productivity, competitiveness, and development amid global economic shifts, geopolitical tensions and digital acceleration.

Our report shows that countries that leverage on local strengths, build diverse innovation ecosystems and develop deep capabilities are in a better place to win the innovation race.

said WIPO Director General Daren Tang, adding

We hope that policymakers will find the data and insights in this report useful and interesting as they build durable innovation ecosystems that brings real growth over decades.

To help guide policymakers, the report documented:

Power of local capabilities: Countries often use their existing innovation capabilities as a springboard for diversification. Innovation capabilities based on scientific, technological and production know-how in a particular country or region can be measured by studying the data on scientific publications, patent applications and international trade respectively. For example:

Countries often use their existing innovation capabilities as a springboard for diversification. Innovation capabilities based on scientific, technological and production know-how in a particular country or region can be measured by studying the data on scientific publications, patent applications and international trade respectively. For example: Economic Specialization and Diversification: Analysis of nearly 40 million patent filings, over 70 million scientific papers and economic activity worth more than 300 trillion dollars in goods and services exports, reveals that innovative outcomes are highly concentrated. Over the past 20 years, for example, the top eight countries account for 50 percent of exports, 60 percent of scientific publications and 80 percent of international patenting.

But change is occurring: China, India and the Republic of Korea saw big increases in their technological diversification over the period. China jumped from being specialized in only 16% to 94% of all technological capabilities, the Republic of Korea's technological capabilities went from 40% to 83%, and India saw its technological capabilities double from 9% to 21%.

Complex capabilities are rare and only diversified innovation ecosystems can make use of them. Of the three types of innovation capabilities, technological capabilities are the most complex and also more likely to generate higher growth.

Case Studies Spotlight

The WIPR focuses on three case studies across eight countries to reveal insights on how innovators and policymakers leveraged and enhanced existing industrial capabilities to create the advanced and sophisticated motorcycles, videogames and agricultural technologies of today.

Motorcycles Industry - full throttle on innovation

The documented evolution of the motorcycle industry is a key example of human innovation and economic diversification, which economists and policymakers can use to spur sustainable, long-term growth across the globe.

The experiences of Italy, Japan and India show how historical ties with closely related sectors - including bicycles, automobiles, and aviation – have allowed them to carve out their own unique specialized trajectories within the same innovative and complex industry.

For instance, Italian motorcycles excel in high-performance and groundbreaking design thanks to vibrant know-how in racing and top of the line craftsmanship; the big four Japanese motorcycles companies (Honda, Yamaha, Kawasaki, Suzuki) dominate the global market by exploiting Japan’s complex innovation capabilities on advanced technologies, product reliability, and sophisticated supply-chain logistics (keiretsu) ; and Indian motorcycle companies have emerged as a key global industry player catapulted by India’s capabilities on cost efficient production, particularly prioritizing fuel-efficient engines.

The motorcycle case study provides evidence of strategic implementation of industrial policies, such as those that enhanced the rise of national champions in Japan or faster adoption of electric two- and three-wheelers in India.

Today, the motorcycle industry is in a new and disruptive transformational journey driven by changing consumer preferences, a heightened focus on sustainability and technological shifts. Electrification, artificial intelligence, and enhanced connectivity technologies are revolutionizing the industry.

Agricultural Leveraging Technologies

The agricultural sector is undergoing a spectacular technological transformation as shown by the 239% increase of patent protected agriculture inventions in the last decade. New scientific breakthroughs in genetic engineering and the adoption of frontier robotic and digital technologies are increasing the innovation sophistication of one of the oldest economic activities.

The increase in innovation complexity in the agricultural sector is happening around the world. For instance, scientists in Kenya have leveraged their plant breeding capabilities to create a pest-resistant maize variety successfully being used across the African continent. In Brazil, sugarcane and sugar production capabilities were the standpoint for Brazil's global leadership of ethanol related technologies helping consumers find sustainable fossil-fuel alternatives.

The Rise of the Global Videogame Industry

The videogame case study showcases how seemingly unrelated existing capabilities can be used to create an innovative and sophisticated new industry.

The video game industry is a breeding ground for new businesses, with around 45% of game developers being newly founded companies. This dynamic environment fosters competition and innovation, contributing to the industry's rapid growth.

In addition, the report finds that around 15% of new video games launched each year are based on existing intellectual property (excluding sequels).

The development of the global video game industry has seen regional hubs navigating unique challenges and capitalizing on local strengths. The four video game industry hubs discussed in the chapter demonstrate how local expertise, cultural capital and interconnected industries collectively have influenced the industry's evolution and offer strategic insights for policymakers.

World IP Report 2024: A Guide for Policy Makers

The report provides a new policy toolkit that can help countries replicate these success stories. By identifying over 600 technological, scientific and production capabilities spread around the world, the new framework allow decision takers to design smart policies based on empirical evidence.

Policy makers can see where, when and how to target their innovation policies, either by nurturing their strengths, or by leveraging them to attain new and exciting scientific, technological and production opportunities.",planning office expansion

Every company must have an office as the center of the company's operational activities. The office is a component that must be owned by every company, the office functions as a center for gathering information, a place to store assets and as a place for the main operational activities of all activities in the company. The office is a room that is used for routine activities and activities to achieve the goals of the company. A strategic office location is one of the supports for business success and will have a big impact on the company because it will affect operational activities for the company. So it is very important for companies to have an office with a strategic location and it is important for companies to have a good location strategy. This paper describes several factors and methods that can be used in determining office locations. In this paper using the literature study method in which the author searches for some literature that is in accordance with the problems of this paper. Library Studies are sourced from books, e-books, journals, papers and so on.

How does ""A Christmas Memory"" provide symbolism? 2. How does the symbolism enhance and deepen the story's meaning? 1. The act of making fruitcakes in ""A Christmas Memory"" serves as a symbol of love and tradition. a) The characters, Buddy and his cousin, spend time selecting ingredients and carefully following a family recipe, which represents their strong bond and commitment to preserving cherished memories. b) Each step of the process, from collecting pecans to mixing the batter, reflects their attention to detail and dedication to creating a special gift for others. c) The act of giving the fruitcakes to acquaintances and strangers symbolizes their generosity and desire to spread joy during the holiday season. 2. The use of kites in the story also carries symbolic significance. a) The kites represent freedom and escapism for Buddy and his cousin, who live in a restrictive and isolating environment. b) By flying the kites, they are able to experience moments of joy and excitement, effectively breaking free from the constraints of their everyday lives. c) The kites can be seen as symbols of hope and optimism, as the characters use them to create moments of happiness despite their difficult circumstances. 3. The presence of a Christmas tree serves as a powerful symbol in the story. a) The Christmas tree represents tradition and nostalgia, as it is a familiar symbol of holiday celebrations and family togetherness. b) However, the characters' efforts to gather a tree from the nearby woods also symbolize their resourcefulness and determination in making the best of their limited resources. c) The act of decorating the tree with homemade ornaments and tinsel reflects the characters' creativity and ingenuity in bringing holiday cheer to their home. 4. The characters' close relationship with nature and animals provides rich symbolism in ""A Christmas Memory."" a) Their interactions with the natural world, such as collecting holly and foraging for ingredients, represent their connection to the earth and its abundance. b) The presence of their beloved dog, Queenie, symbolizes loyalty, companionship, and unconditional love, as the animal faithfully accompanies them on their adventures and offers comfort in times of need. c) The characters' appreciation for nature and animals suggests a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of all living things and the value of simple pleasures in life.",intends to open new office
5,“It's a human thing”: open-plan offices versus flexible spaces,https://www.ie-uk.com/blog/open-plan-offices,,"For years, open-plan office spaces have been believed to facilitate better teamwork, collaboration and innovation. This philosophy is so ingrained that it’s become ubiquitous - 69% of offices have an open floor plan, according to Steelcase research.

But a study by Harvard Business School (HBS) has revealed why open workplaces often fail to foster the collaboration they’re designed for.

Do open offices really work?

The research, led by HBS professor Ethan Bernstein, set out to understand what actually happens when employees move from cubicle spaces to open spaces. It followed two Fortune 500 companies as they made this move.

Hoping to see an increase in collaboration, what these companies actually experienced was a 70% drop in face-to-face interactions, and an increase in email and messaging by 50%.

As Bernstein explains in an interview for HBR IdeaCast:

“Good or bad, it was an unintended consequence of the move and was certainly not what had been billed to them in terms of what open spaces would create – the vibrancy, the nature of interaction, the collisions that people would have within the open space.”

So why does stripping away the cubicle walls to create an open and transparent space not facilitate a more collaborative culture?

Is it a human thing?

After checking the data and cutting it in every which way to see if they’d made a mistake in the way they’d compared it, Bernstein concluded that the shift in behaviour came down to how workers adapted to the new office space.

“The anatomy, the actual interactions that human beings decided to have or not to have in certain parts of that space didn’t go the way they expected the architecture to push it, which is in some respects a nice finding about humanity. We’re not controlled by the spaces we work in.”

“But it also reminds us that because of that, we react to the spaces we work in, in ways that might not have been intended by the designers.”

When people are used to working in a cubicle where they’re protected from distractions and have privacy to get their work done, and then find themselves in an open and observable space, new behaviours emerge.

And these behaviours are at odds with what designers’ expect and business managers’ desire.

As Bernstein explains,

“How do I block out noise? I put on headphones. How do I block out vision? I focus my eyesight somewhere. How do I avoid interruption? I go somewhere else. I work from home. I work from Starbucks.”

“There are ways that we can achieve the same function that those previous walls provided. And we just do so unfortunately at the cost of what the company’s trying to make us do - collaborate.”

Workers create these “fourth walls”, and they spread quickly, especially in open spaces because everyone can see each other.

So while the design of the workspace can influence workers’ behaviour, it will always be the workers who decide when and how to interact.

Are flexible office spaces the answer?

It’s not the open space itself that is at fault, but what we do with it and how we choose to fill it that is causing the problem.

For Bernstein, flexible spaces offer the best of both worlds. A hybrid office space that supports the changing activity and behaviours that it is required to host means people can choose where they want to work at any given time; the space that best fits their needs.

When seeking privacy and quiet, instead of putting headphones in and staring intently to signal to colleagues they don’t want to be disturbed, workers can retreat from the group into enclosed spaces to absorb information and process their own ideas.

When needing to work as a team, they can use spaces that allow people to sit, stand, draw on boards, move materials and objects.

How do we create spaces where people want to be?

According to Bernstein, the best way to find the optimal workplace design for particular groups is to run real experiments.

“You have to take a design thinking approach. The only way to get there is to experiment lots and lots of smaller, less expensive, more flexible experiments, hopefully not conducted from the top down, but even across the employees that you want to be more innovative and collaborative. Let them see the results that get collected, and ultimately improve and change, little by little, the office space together.”

These experiments need to be run by the people working in the space, not the managers.

But start small. Optimising collaboration doesn’t have to mean a radical overhaul of the office space. Small tweaks can make a big difference, even just moving desks or other furniture around.

And sometimes the best answer doesn’t involve changes to the physical structure. Bernstein and co-author Ben Waber shared examples in their recent article ""The Truth About Open Offices"":

“To help integrate new hires during their first week on the job, a midsize technology company puts jars of cookies on their desks and posts a map in the lobby showing the jars’ locations, to encourage people to stop by.”

“Humanyze discovered that the location of its coffee machines significantly influences interactions. If a team needs to focus internally, the company puts a coffee machine in the center of its area. If two teams need to collaborate, it puts the machine between them.”

Takeaways

Organisations are increasingly recognising that open office spaces don’t work in the way designers’ and office managers’ expect. Workers often react to the new space by adopting new behaviours that achieve the same function that cubicle walls provided.

Flexible spaces allow people to choose where they want to work based on what they need to get the job done, whether it’s privacy and quiet, or interaction and vibrancy.

But what we really need to do is create spaces where people want to work. This means getting workers involved in testing out new flexible arrangements and evaluating the impact.",plans to open new office
